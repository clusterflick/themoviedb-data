An impressionistic work with very close shots that cut out reality until, for example, the faces of the characters are omitted. A kind of description and brief chronicle of daily life in a house for a few minutes serves as a framework for the irruption of an unusual tragedy. Filmed without sound, it lacks any subsequent dialogue, although a piano band with a jazzy air has been added.","popularity":0.1195,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1955-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before breakfast","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Saura","original_name":"Carlos Saura","popularity":0.2793,"profile_path":"/wd3o1AA10A5Bd8Et81dJBYCCXpB.jpg","credit_id":"5bae9706925141510c060759","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julio Diamante","original_name":"Julio Diamante","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bae96e90e0a2664d006718d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julio Diamante","original_name":"Julio Diamante","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bae96f492514150ff05b639","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1955-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
