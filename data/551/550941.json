This unique island has a long and complex history of natural and human evolution, and is remarkable for its blend of rustic farmland, chic resorts, and grimy low-budget tourism - heavily dependent on British and German vacationers. This work represents the island through the centuries, chronicling its changes and equally temporary visitations. These changes include the impact of mass tourism and natural alterations, such as the common brush fires and the invasive Asian Palm Weevil that has been decimating the palmsâ€” icons of beach vacations.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/i5y7PYLDE0LXjLaBiH06ti4qPNh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Visitors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2137162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Carter","original_name":"Rob Carter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bae4487c3a3683a9c05f782","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2137162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Carter","original_name":"Rob Carter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bae4490c3a3683aaa05c400","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9060006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i5y7PYLDE0LXjLaBiH06ti4qPNh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
