As the city in the film is seen being empty, the flaneur – an unidentified traveller of the non-human nature, explores the city's architecture reminiscent of the pre-given desires and systems of attachment that embraces us all. Followed by the voices of the phone-sex operators, the trip is a dedication to the libidinal economy and the escaped fantasies that emerge.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Desire For Things To Work","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2097300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerda Paliušytė","original_name":"Gerda Paliušytė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba7d4c30e0a2635dd02e2a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
