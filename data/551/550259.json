Using intuitive and expressionist visual language and a striking specially composed soundtrack (by Stuart Jones) the film is a movement through land, sky, colour, sound and music that is both sensual and visually challenging. In Stan Brakhage’s words, Cezanne's Eye is “the most significant camera as paintbrush film in the history of cinema”.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/tVTYiYvCKbuCpZtggJaGFSIeCoA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of Great Britain","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cezanne's Eye","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1425225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Maziere","original_name":"Michael Maziere","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/p1H72UKyFrSj2y0umS9SzdN3ivQ.jpg","credit_id":"5ba9922e92514151df003e29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2134694,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stuart Jones","original_name":"Stuart Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba99240c3a36839fe004725","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8789550","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nl6z97rDoJiWGG09uGEgRD6NQW4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tVTYiYvCKbuCpZtggJaGFSIeCoA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":852},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iYMTa4CSrLSORUZ8pTWaZe9XnYG.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
