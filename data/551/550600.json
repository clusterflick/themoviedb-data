Since then, it has grown into an organization that treats more than a million patients a year from all 50 states and 150 countries. Dr. Mayo had a simple philosophy he imparted to his sons Will and Charlie: \"the needs of the patient come first.\" They wouldn't treat diseases...they would treat people. In a world where healthcare delivery is typically fragmented among individual specialties, the Mayo Clinic practices a multi-specialty, team-based approach that has, from its beginnings, created a culture that thrives on collaboration.","popularity":1.2703,"poster_path":"/jZUVcfpeH3qCjkLpowOAiBJkZXb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10725,"logo_path":"/rLfwt5kPoXfJweOsEDgJhhBnN7Q.png","name":"WETA","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United
