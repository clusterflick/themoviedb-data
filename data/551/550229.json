Mark Eccleston is an athlete who has overcome tremendous adversity - this frank, fearless and often funny film tells his triumph of the human spirit. He became one of the world's leading wheelchair tennis players and held the World No 1 spot for fourteen months. He went on to win a silver medal in the Athens Paralympics in 2004. Mark could never have achieved this level of success without the great will power he shows daily - and a philosophy which is as useful to the able bodied as to the disabled.","popularity":0.254,"poster_path":"/oVU1LvFklkgecPisGvnTzn3SHTV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pushing the Limits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fiona Gélin","original_name":"Fiona Gélin","popularity":0.2652,"profile_path":"/1S4GLc0EFapkZht0uKhkmeV2gl.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Fiona","credit_id":"5ba93e99c3a3680e68058ab2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1711617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Twight","original_name":"Mark Twight","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Xigor Copeland","credit_id":"5ba93ed89251412ef4051278","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Meeks","original_name":"Edward Meeks","popularity":0.3,"profile_path":"/uc2Y543rIkUeRwWZ1UXREVlElM6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Farjonnes","credit_id":"5ba93ef69251412f0705273a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Gélin","original_name":"Daniel Gélin","popularity":0.293,"profile_path":"/i5zZUU4IhqmJ8EZtbBy2hDRrAyl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Le père de Fiona","credit_id":"5ba93f08c3a3680e520565dc","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Donard","original_name":"Thierry Donard","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62708975cc277c0066991a2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0110919","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.754,"height":1017,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/oVU1LvFklkgecPisGvnTzn3SHTV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":767}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1994-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
