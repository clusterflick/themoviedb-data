During this time, a messianic prophecy arose in the countryside of an infant warrior that would be born that could overthrow the conquering Tang, heralded by a flying horse. Into this situation we meet a peasant, A Sadal, who we first discover stealing a Buddha statue from temple and stealing food from an old man dying of hunger. We then meet his wife, Sae Onyeo, and the happily married pair soon conceive and bear a child. However, reports of a flying horse abound and the Tang start a campaign to find the infant warrior, with potential consequences for the new parents in addition to the rest of their village.","popularity":0.0782,"poster_path":"/pFQqzYSCn1LFoRm2zNuD9700ocG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once Upon a Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baek Il-seob","original_name":"백일섭","popularity":0.3108,"profile_path":"/uKi44f5K34SYeOM7N4gKXzl4PUQ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"A Sadal","credit_id":"5ba9757a92514151cb000c1d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1318144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yu Hyun-mok","original_name":"유현목","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":"/z15TCDqi62XpbUKlTASWe7eENuO.jpg","credit_id":"5ba975980e0a26611e000d86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0324622","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1408,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pFQqzYSCn1LFoRm2zNuD9700ocG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":938}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"1978-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
