The Canadian participants range in age from 20 to 90 years old and are in either a heterosexual or homosexual relationship. The documentary depicts an 80-year evolution in culture and attitude toward mixed relationships in both China and Canada. It explores the participant's social background and how their romance began as well as food habits, language and communication, intimacy, financial management, child education, pop culture, and culture shock. The documentary's tone mixes humor with reflective and emotional moments.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/kjDNXhDiGwmq7foWm3raZJdL7NT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109182,"logo_path":null,"name":"UpFilm Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An uncapped look at Chinese mixed relationships.","title":"Ketchup & Soya Sauce","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2134187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhi-Min Hu","original_name":"Zhi-Min Hu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba858240e0a2635f603d9e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2134187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhi-Min Hu","original_name":"Zhi-Min Hu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba85834c3a3680e500437f1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7980744","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ow0U8YmvPjVwS1tkrQJ3pXvGdRS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v3RhVFkZMxGPXdhjXI2nf4iuC0U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kjDNXhDiGwmq7foWm3raZJdL7NT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1013},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qPZrP2jeIEppQOwaju7scGJAQnu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1013}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ketchup & Soya Sauce Trailer","key":"9Eu-0PhwrE4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-09-24T19:30:28.000Z","id":"5fa2769e6782590035a08309"}]}}}
