The novel tells the story of Ta'li, a young runaway whose Cherokee ancestors died on the Trail of Tears. Searching for peace for herself and the world, Ta'li finds herself in the swamps of Southern Illinois' Cache River, where, with the help of the Swamp Asp and the legendary Big Muddy Monster, she embarks on a daring quest to bring her vision of empathy, empowerment, unity, social justice and ecological wisdom to a humanity seemingly bent on self-destruction.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/fy2C0moJx1HhNrdHjuIKG86HcfN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cache Girl Saves the World: A Novel in Visions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1541633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thirza Defoe","original_name":"Thirza Defoe","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/gMAwr5e0JfKyZ41vmqWsMjnILdp.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Ta'li","credit_id":"5badec2fc3a3683ac0052c1e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Dukes","original_name":"Anna Dukes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The prosecutor","credit_id":"5badec410e0a2664df052416","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shavon Jackson","original_name":"Shavon Jackson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Maid in bar","credit_id":"5badec510e0a2664d705177a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Lazenby","original_name":"Walter Lazenby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The earth (voice)","credit_id":"5badec630e0a2664cc0552eb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric S.
