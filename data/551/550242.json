In October of 1998 Adam Green and Will Barratt threw together a short film called \"Columbus Day Weekend\" to screen at a Halloween party. Little did they know that it would give birth to an annual tradition that would span two decades and spawn a feature film and television production studio that would become a leader of the indie horror scene. FOR THE LOVE OF HALLOWEEN is a walk down memory lane with all of your favorite key players from the ArieScope family as they share the candid stories behind 20 years of Halloween shorts.","popularity":0.9961,"poster_path":"/kkpl4zkm37hKGPWINngCGzESQ3x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For the Love of Halloween","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70890,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Green","original_name":"Adam Green","popularity":0.2715,"profile_path":"/b6L3KHNumlumhySfspBaeOA7Zxr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ba96104c3a3680e5805997a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70898,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Will Barratt","original_name":"Will Barratt","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ba961170e0a2635f905ba26","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":70893,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah Elbert","original_name":"Sarah Elbert","popularity":0.1298,"profile_path":"/y6aXr1YKjVnIQWM5QbE5zhdnXu7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ba96126c3a3680e61059d7f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel David Moore","original_name":"Joel David Moore","popularity":0.9671,"profile_path":"/mMVhVglj6BZFuvqAXnEibce08k7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ba961369251412f07056012","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kane Hodder","original_name":"Kane Hodder","popularity":0.9488,"profile_path":"/avMGd9rA2ys1pJok1EGOa46MEQX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ba961470e0a2635ec05f7ed","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Haig","original_name":"Sid Haig","popularity":0.8852,"profile_path":"/vl3bpah8selBmSUDtF9irkHyvIO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ba96157c3a3680e6805caab","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek Mears","original_name":"Derek Mears","popularity":0.5012,"profile_path":"/2ckpSGUa4EDKWS1KMP0hLtFUWi.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ba961690e0a2635f005ab4b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Ortiz","original_name":"Laura Ortiz","popularity":0.1889,"profile_path":"/wzYpRVsJPbyMX3hdgBuwo8Zut7x.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ba96178c3a3680e5505c0dc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Solet","original_name":"Paul Solet","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/zdVK7S9CRTmhpByU7MP89IZCZtF.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ba9618bc3a3680e580599fc","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67980,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dave Parker","original_name":"Dave Parker","popularity":0.1165,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ba9619a0e0a2635dd0591ad","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":210355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brea Grant","original_name":"Brea Grant","popularity":0.8355,"profile_path":"/mrRs33aqbd3porc72LZRkk9ECJ0.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ba961a79251412f070560c2","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Ackerman","original_name":"Ed Ackerman","popularity":0.1952,"profile_path":"/idirAWlgShb9EYfgfNFEzdCrDRO.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ba961b49251412f0d056649","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Austin Bosley","original_name":"Austin Bosley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba960ed9251412ef4054d5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9026136","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kkpl4zkm37hKGPWINngCGzESQ3x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
