There is hardly any representation in Nostos I: just enough to tip-toe around the edges of analogy, illusion, under the image and in between images.\" Unfolding as memory traces and dream images, figures and objects appear and disappear, decompose and recompose; disjointed fragments evolve in continuous transformation and manipulations of light and time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9ok86xWhnafF6cC9ANL8agOfkaN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nostos I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2137229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Kuntzel","original_name":"Thierry Kuntzel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bae5303c3a3683a97063b41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0183583","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9ok86xWhnafF6cC9ANL8agOfkaN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
