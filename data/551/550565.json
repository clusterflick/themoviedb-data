It shows the funeral of an ordinary Chinese man, surrounded by his family. One witnesses the enshrined body, the cremation of the deceased and the immediate handing over afterwords of his remains to the family members. The film provides a very intimate perspective on contemporary Chinese culture, where Taoist burial rites are blended with modern secular customs. The process brings to mind a theater performance with stage, acting and scenery, embodying the transition from the living to the death.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor Rao","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2135655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexej Tchernyi","original_name":"Alexej Tchernyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bab6e440e0a2664d4021556","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2135655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexej Tchernyi","original_name":"Alexej Tchernyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bab6e76c3a3683aaf022286","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2135656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wu Zhi","original_name":"Wu Zhi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bab6e5892514150f101f626","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2135656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wu Zhi","original_name":"Wu Zhi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bab6e64c3a3683ac002319d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1895507","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
