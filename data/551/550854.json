It recovers the remarkable \"women's campaigns\" of the 1950s against the hated pass system. This massive, non-violent civil disobedience movement was only finally crushed by the 1960 Sharpeville Massacre and the banning of anti-apartheid organizations. Lilian Ngoyi, Helen Joseph, Dora Tamana and other leaders recall this struggle and their imprisonment and banning. Yet they remain undaunted, demonstrating the South African proverb: \"When you have touched a woman, you have struck a rock.\"","popularity":0.3937,"poster_path":"/8B4aBIA2LgQPQ3PaYtT2d0aXFxV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Have Struck a Rock!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilian Ngoyi","original_name":"Lilian Ngoyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5bad841592514150eb04597f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dora Tamana","original_name":"Dora Tamana","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5bad842d92514150f1044d69","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Joseph","original_name":"Helen Joseph","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5bad843d0e0a2664cc04e225","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amina Cachalia","original_name":"Amina Cachalia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5bad84d992514150f1044df7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Baard","original_name":"Frances Baard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5bad85000e0a2664e204aceb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Letta Mbulu","original_name":"Letta Mbulu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5bad88ee0e0a2664df04c19c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136882,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Diana Boernstein","original_name":"Diana Boernstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bad891092514150ee043e0a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":160292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah May","original_name":"Deborah May","popularity":0.2627,"profile_path":"/sDIjyEedUwno1vRI4rLwEsKj3mM.jpg","credit_id":"5cf2afe3c3a3685e7c2399f1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":160292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah May","original_name":"Deborah May","popularity":0.2627,"profile_path":"/sDIjyEedUwno1vRI4rLwEsKj3mM.jpg","credit_id":"5cf2afdac3a368697a213305","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":160292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah May","original_name":"Deborah May","popularity":0.2627,"profile_path":"/sDIjyEedUwno1vRI4rLwEsKj3mM.jpg","credit_id":"5cf2afd1c3a368697a213300","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0212625","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8B4aBIA2LgQPQ3PaYtT2d0aXFxV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":796,"name":"police brutality"},{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":3644,"name":"south africa"},{"id":4411,"name":"sexism"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":158217,"name":"colonialism"},{"id":198429,"name":"anti-apartheid"},{"id":212915,"name":"women's rights"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
