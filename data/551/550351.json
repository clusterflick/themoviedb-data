The toilet completed, the huge quadrupeds are next seen at exercise, where, at the word of their director, they execute a number of wonderfully intelligent stunts, among which are lying down limp, rolling over, balancing and posing. In the next view two of the largest of the herd are pitted against each other in a ramming contest. A mahout mounted on each beast, they place their heads together and each endeavors to push the other back. The last view given is that of the elephants mounting a gangway to the top of a chute, from which each goes sliding down the way, finally splashing into a pond.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1907-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les éléphants de l'Inde","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2102365","wikidata_id":"Q18230919","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1907-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
