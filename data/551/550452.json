Taking this ancient title as its point of departure, a new narrative was re-assembled from a variety of similarly ancient films about going off to, and returning from, the Sea. The characters in these old films appear to be emerging from the roiling oceans of Time, having floated like messages in bottles for over one hundred years, and now having washed up on our shores to tell us their stories.","popularity":0.2276,"poster_path":"/25KM8PdqTKedJ0IIVycdZr5ewz4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unchanging Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Morrison","original_name":"Bill Morrison","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/9pwxNAvq6fh2q6aFrp17BdRxtvk.jpg","credit_id":"5baaca01c3a3683ab500ece6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088623,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Gordon","original_name":"Michael Gordon","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674c3a4552a9951a0098146b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8623718","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/25KM8PdqTKedJ0IIVycdZr5ewz4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9p4q4RLjYdw0HS6B8ohKLRZ267A.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":514}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":290279,"name":"repurposed footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn_cwUzA3kE","release_date":"2016-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
