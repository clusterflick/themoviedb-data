This series of performances from the prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival now makes a part of this legacy available on DVD for the first time.\r Oscar Peterson is quite simply one of the greatest jazz piano players of all time. This rare and stunning solo concert from 1975 gives a chance to see Peterson up close in an intimate setting and appreciate just how good he really is. The show includes swinging performances of Indiana, At Long Last Love, Mirage and a medley led by The Ellington classic Take the A Train.","popularity":0.127,"poster_path":"/fsM3IS1Mnq655KVtDyns18hzPr9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Norman Granz' Jazz in Montreaux presents Oscar Peterson Solo '75","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Peterson","original_name":"Oscar Peterson","popularity":0.3576,"profile_path":"/jqwITu95Ma2j3mMZYfWV1H9ULTQ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Oscar Peterson","credit_id":"5ba930470e0a2635f3056697","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230196,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claude Nobs","original_name":"Claude Nobs","popularity":0.1268,"profile_path":"/jPPr8Ht6JMv174ILJD1iPQ9isgq.jpg","credit_id":"5f4076b0c175b2003560c170","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fsM3IS1Mnq655KVtDyns18hzPr9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":526}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
