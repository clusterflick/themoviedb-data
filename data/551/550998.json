Robert Kramer makes one of the six short films that illustrates the cultural side of the decade Mittérand. Here we see a director of cinema in the suburbs of Caen, in her room lined with flower paper. This for art and essay cinema. There, the critic Serge Daney in a sailor's cap, for a chat by the fire. An overview of French cinema today, \"Pickpocket\" on television. Then back on you. The camera slides on the desk that we imagine to be Kramer's. Finally, the camera flies over Paris, slides along the facades, stops on a window, entering the skylight: \"The films invite to see ... I invite you to see Jean Genet's hotel room.\"","popularity":0.325,"poster_path":"/7pIA8CfYsjVhqxSGC7QQ1s6SHV0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leeward","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2137424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Belguise","original_name":"Nicole Belguise","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5baecf60c3a3682d900016ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10353,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michel Choquet","original_name":"Michel Choquet","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5baecf73c3a3682d85001261","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Daney","original_name":"Serge Daney","popularity":0.1301,"profile_path":"/tn84EGNTmx1FWguCdvRd6DVnPyH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5baecf7f9251413cf700108d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Kramer","original_name":"Robert Kramer","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":"/tSbaZNs37qLaVic7m4IDZZBz558.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5baecf979251413cf200153e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Béatrice Michel","original_name":"Béatrice Michel","popularity":0.1189,"profile_path":"/ns1ow4AU9nBOUG4lduTEDN4FV6W.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5baecfa39251413cfc0012e0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2137425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Tavernier","original_name":"Philippe Tavernier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5baecfb19251413cfc0012f6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2137426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geneviève Troussier","original_name":"Geneviève Troussier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5baecfc5c3a3682d89001414","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Kramer","original_name":"Robert Kramer","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":"/tSbaZNs37qLaVic7m4IDZZBz558.jpg","credit_id":"5baecf32c3a3682d89001349","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Kramer","original_name":"Robert Kramer","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":"/tSbaZNs37qLaVic7m4IDZZBz558.jpg","credit_id":"5baecf440e0a265461001695","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7001654","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7pIA8CfYsjVhqxSGC7QQ1s6SHV0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
