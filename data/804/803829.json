In the film we see this balance taking place through images of her dancing in traditional regalia as well as her involvement in the United Nations 16th forum on Indigenous Issues. This film is also about her personal experiences with depression and self-doubt, both of which are addressed through perseverance, her cultural practices, and participation in international advocacy for Indigenous peoples.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
