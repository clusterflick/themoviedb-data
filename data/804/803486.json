It talks about love, affection, respect, humility, temperance and courage. It talks about balance with oneself and the other. It is the voice of a territory and a tradition where the jaguar dwells and seeks to be heard.  It is a tour through the mountains, jungles and plains where the jaguar has directly engaged with humans, creating a millenary journey of chants, myths and cultural traditions which narrate the history of the man-jaguar relationship, and speak to the importance of preserving this species which finds itself severely threatened.","popularity":0.0702,"poster_path":"/dv2q8JvJHJ3nRxGuoxGOylJrO7K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150471,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruge Films","origin_country":""},{"id":150472,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canoa Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2021-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The fangs are the force, the energy, from them comes our power.","title":"Jaguar: Voice of a Territory","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simón González Vélez","original_name":"Simón González Vélez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60455d588813e4006e932380","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simón González Vélez","original_name":"Simón González Vélez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60455d6da410c800455cdd00","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simón González Vélez","original_name":"Simón González Vélez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60455d842b8a4300579ab087","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002255,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carlos Londoño Sánchez","original_name":"Carlos Londoño Sánchez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60455dcc0102c900774b7026","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002256,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrés Quintero Campos","original_name":"Andrés Quintero Campos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60455deb9e4586002438e3ec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002256,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrés Quintero Campos","original_name":"Andrés Quintero Campos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60455e0e15c636005bd2b5e3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simón González Vélez","original_name":"Simón González Vélez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60455e9c50733c005ad7f95f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659457,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Alejandro Zuluaga","original_name":"Alejandro Zuluaga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60455ec52b8a43002ee5ef87","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002261,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jim Cho Santos","original_name":"Jim Cho Santos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60455ee1126ec3002ad1ee5b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3002256,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrés Quintero Campos","original_name":"Andrés Quintero Campos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60455efae18b9700590e6d4c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Jaguarvozdeunterritorio","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":984,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/dv2q8JvJHJ3nRxGuoxGOylJrO7K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER OFICIAL JAGUAR VOZ DE UN TERRITORIO","key":"MJPzLlV44vw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-08-04T21:31:59.000Z","id":"6045598c8813e40059e0a31d"}]}}}
