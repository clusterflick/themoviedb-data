Both lust for him but one feels no CHEMISTRY and the other likes his LEGS but does not want to meet. Confused he shaves his head, makes his body the internet, so through him they can ‘online’ date until a new full moon appears… and with it hopefully some clarity. Examining the queer millennial shift into online dating, pop-astrology philosophy and ever present effects of a pandemic that stripped us of touch, this film is a reflection of modern gay romance.","popularity":0.0438,"poster_path":"/74G6IzrGoB8YKgOt1TaYbeq7h0q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"buzzcut make me the moon, make my body internet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3003362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Patrick-Walker","original_name":"Andrew Patrick-Walker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6046b9f890fca300451564f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3003364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Amália","original_name":"Luis Amália","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6046b9ff84f249005a56719f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2150076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Gulczynski","original_name":"Grant Gulczynski","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6046b9c95f622b006da697f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2150076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Gulczynski","original_name":"Grant Gulczynski","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6046b9cec8a5ac004572c75c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2150076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Gulczynski","original_name":"Grant Gulczynski","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6046b9d65f622b006da697fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2150076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Gulczynski","original_name":"Grant Gulczynski","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6046b9dfe18b970078e9ecc0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2150076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Gulczynski","original_name":"Grant Gulczynski","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6046b9e8d185720077981fd8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288160,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ben Goodall","original_name":"Ben Goodall","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6046b9f070b44400459be912","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15063038","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/74G6IzrGoB8YKgOt1TaYbeq7h0q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Image + Nation","release_date":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
