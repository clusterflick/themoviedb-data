Drawing on research into the thirty year scientific collaboration between animal cognition scientist Irene Pepperberg and an African Grey she trained in elements of human language, Wow and Flutter considers the various forms of displacement often at play in our understanding of animals. It features a score made in collaboration with musician Andrew Fogarty, which uses a mixture of field recordings, electronics and found material to conjure a unique sound world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gqIUt8YxAcaDplOzWMkUxzaAmwO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How does one make nature speak?","title":"Wow and Flutter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2110756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jenny Brady","original_name":"Jenny Brady","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6044060184f249006fe1f059","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3001064,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrew Fogarty","original_name":"Andrew Fogarty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60440618f12cf40045e79ec8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gqIUt8YxAcaDplOzWMkUxzaAmwO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Wow and Flutter, 2013 (excerpt)","key":"132725425","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-07-06T15:34:03.000Z","id":"604406460102c90059d123a3"}]}}}
