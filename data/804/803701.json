She is almost 70 years old, while he is 38 years her junior. Andréa asks journalist and writer Michèle Manceaux to interview him about his life with Duras, an obsession that both impassions him and drives him mad. He believes by entrusting their story to Manceaux, he may gain more clarity of the relationship. What follows is an intense and compelling conversation delving into the deepest recesses of modern love.","popularity":0.3231,"poster_path":"/hQldaApF9aWgxrnoHbb5AO1654n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6669,"logo_path":"/c33aVgKEOenOIYySDxuNlH6R0J7.png","name":"Les Films de
