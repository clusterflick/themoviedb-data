Hell, very few vids these days have much energy to them. They all seem to be about nailing the trick - which is important - but there's also this thing called cinematography. 2nd To None has a fast pace and awesome skating.  The intro montage is stunning. Filmed in the warehouse, it features the team sessioning everything from the top of a forklift to jumping gaps from one product rack to another. They pile stuff high and go wild on every surface in the place - including a few ramps. Some street footy is edited in as well. This vid is so well done, it's insane.  Each rider has a part, some of which is in the warehouse, but most is out on the streets. They mix in some skits and other random stuff. There's a \"Chariots of Fire\" routine in which they push - in super slow-mo - doing a variety of tricks while trying to sabotage each other's runs.","popularity":0.1323,"poster_path":"/goNhBgEeWbVMR5FaiZeESjHaXe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deca: 2nd to None","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/goNhBgEeWbVMR5FaiZeESjHaXe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":390,"name":"skateboarding"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
