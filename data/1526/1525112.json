Filmed by international activists and Palestinians between December 2003 and March 2004, the film represents the suffering and struggle of the Palestinian people. Composed of interviews with Balata residents and footage from the 2003-2004 New Year's invasion, the film offers a unique view of Balata Refugee Camp. During this invasion, 5 people were killed, 2 homes were demolished and dozens were injured. The 30,000 residents were held under 24-hour home imprisonment for the four-week period without access to food, medical services or supplies. Yet the residents of the camp continued to resist by breaking curfew, throwing stones, walking past tanks to attend school. Raw street footage shows the conditions people were forced to live under and their acts of resistance.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sun Doesn't Shine In The Camp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mika Minio-Paluello","original_name":"Mika Minio-Paluello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890c8234b0724abe4f3e8e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Bornshlegel","original_name":"Kelly Bornshlegel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890c832a8a4b0039a11e127","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
