This documentary tells not only the story of the band's comeback year, but also what it was like to be a young female artist in Finland in the 2000s – and what kind of mark it left. The documentary consists of extensive archive material and recent interviews in which Vesala and Luoti openly talk about painful experiences that did not remain private but became intertwined with PMMP's music, lyrics, and performances.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PMMP keikalla: Ei enää ikinä","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
