This film examines the first-person perspective of first love. We follow Crosley, a theater worker, who, no matter what he does, can’t shake the feelings and memories he holds of a bygone time when his life seemed better. His friends from high school were still around, he had a stable job, and enough free time to pursue his dreams and desires. And most importantly, he had the gift of someone he loved in his life. However, like many of us, Crosley is haunted by the never-ending recollections of a time when he seemed happy. As he remembers back to better days, he will be confronted by the question of what’s more important, having a passion or a pastime.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/pE07aooiWH18N1Dmd1VKp8U7Sqn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":270156,"logo_path":null,"name":"PastAfter Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Passion drives Us.
