The pFarmers pursue various lines of experimental research: producing hormonally elevated dominas, isolating the human gene for submissiveness, and of course bringing their Unconvention Organic GMOs from lab bench to medical bedside. Laughably implausible attempts to mix Green Movement Grassroots Agriculture, High Tech GMO Pharming and unabashed Sado-Masochistic fetish retrainings, pFarm is an erotically charged cinematic experiment in post-human vivocentrism.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"pFARM","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
