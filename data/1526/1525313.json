He's not here for vengeance or justice. He's here for shits and giggles. When people make senseless decisions, ignore common sense, or recklessly endanger others, The Clown steps in with a wicked grin and brutal creativity.  As the body count rises, a group of unlikely survivors begins to question: is The Clown just a psychopath, or is he some kind of twisted force of natural selection? Stylish, sinister, and darkly hilarious, Shits and Giggles skewers the slasher genre with gleeful satire and an unapologetically brutal edge.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shits And Giggles","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5606944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blaize Tudor","original_name":"Blaize Tudor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Clown","credit_id":"689124a54dfa14c6cb2626a4","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37787106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
