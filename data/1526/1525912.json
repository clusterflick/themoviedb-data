Past, present and future are interwoven in their rope; when it breaks unexpectedly, the fates still have one oracle: the twilight of the gods is imminent! Götterdämmerung has more than one ending: Siegfried falls victim to intrigue and to his own innocence, Valhalla goes up in flames, Brünnhilde sacrifices herself to return the ring to the Rhinemaidens. Alliances are forged and immediately broken again, magical potions and helmets create painful confusions, and generational traumas result in general destruction. Everything familiar to humans and gods collapses.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nC53MwfA1gELEElmBwN1sHhonf2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":266,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Götterdämmerung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2575357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"BRYAN
