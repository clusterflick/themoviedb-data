Differing from us, they experience the same feelings. These people are also different in behavior and character. And they really want others to understand them. But ignorance of life, prejudices of others do not allow a person with Down syndrome to go to work or study, to become a full-fledged member of society. During the period of global isolation, we all felt what it is like to be cut off from society. Now imagine that people with Down syndrome live in such isolation constantly, not accepted by society. This film is an attempt to reflect on our universal differences and similarities, regardless of the features.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Я тоже","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
