It places this alongside a new voice, reflecting on Jarman's life, art and home at Prospect Cottage in Dungeness. Jarman created beauty and community in a time of crisis. He lived openly, made work with urgency and built a garden on the shingle that still grows today. Prospect honours this spirit.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prospect","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650078,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Wood","original_name":"Sarah Wood","popularity":0.2241,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68924df54b0724abe4f3ee1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
