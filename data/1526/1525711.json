The double projection tells of the surveillance recordings made by the Polish secret service in the 1980s. Recordings made over several years of the street in Nowa Huta, Poland, where the worker Bogdan Wlosik was murdered by the secret service. From the composition of image and text, the projection becomes a private commentary on the absurdity of the communist system of control. The other video work is a photomontage in which Kowalski connects private and public life by combining photographs from his personal, private photo archive with the archive of a stranger.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2011-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zwischenfälle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1624589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dariusz Kowalski","original_name":"Dariusz Kowalski","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6892301636f8c184f51d5b63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Neuer Kunstverein Wien","release_date":"2011-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
