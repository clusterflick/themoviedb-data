Born to Polish parents who survived the unimaginable horrors of Nazi concentration camps, Guzlowski's poems give voice to the stories passed down from his parents, stories of suffering, resilience, and survival.  The film interweaves interviews with Guzlowski in his home in Virginia, with vivid poetic depictions of his parents' harrowing experiences: the brutality of the German soldiers, the daily horrors of camp life, physical torture, and enslavement in conditions that dehumanized those who endured them. With profound sensitivity and depth, Language of Mules becomes not just a retelling of history, but a meditation on the enduring impact of war on the human psyche.","popularity":0.15,"poster_path":"/6YAtZNe2aLMXjbxSneaTKTEznPy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Language Of Mules","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Guzlowski","original_name":"John Guzlowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"68911bd71584bf6c9f61f798","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Zhort","original_name":"Alex Zhort","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/9kQeprPoiua7lpgQSisERNZaywy.jpg","credit_id":"68911b7de0342ba883b7f742","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Zhort","original_name":"Alex Zhort","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/9kQeprPoiua7lpgQSisERNZaywy.jpg","credit_id":"68911b92763439387bf3e991","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11879500","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xVD69rN23R2XeRBp8wqLnKQXsqk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lAfEc4KEwRlE7jEGLIFMYpzSXZD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6YAtZNe2aLMXjbxSneaTKTEznPy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2652,"name":"nazi"},{"id":496,"name":"poetry"},{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":220343,"name":"diaspora"},{"id":248315,"name":"polish"},{"id":279911,"name":"nazi germany"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
