Inspired by Mahfoza Oude, a Palestinian woman from Salem in the West Bank, photographed in 2005  by Jafaar Ashtiyef embracing her olive tree before it was cut down by Israeli tanks, the film reprocesses this moment through cyanotype and blood, intensifying its emotional weight. Juxtaposed with this is another elderly woman, 20 years later, hugging an olive tree in the safe margins of her garden in Lincoln (UK).","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The last embrace before the fall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4482594,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fenia Kotsopoulou","original_name":"Fenia Kotsopoulou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890a52b42df351c5eb7f77c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
