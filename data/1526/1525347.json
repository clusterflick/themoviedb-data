It was created as part of Creator Camp (https://campstudios.com/ )alongside 10 other incredible filmmakers, each building their own vision from the ground up.  This film means the world to us, not because it’s perfect, but because it’s proof that we can do it. We hope it resonates with anyone chasing something bigger than themselves.\r Support our future projects on Patreon :)","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Were Art Thieves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5060210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Linnik","original_name":"Timothy Linnik","popularity":0.1351,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tommy Lyman","credit_id":"6891376a61ecb3e4d6a46c8e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5060200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phillip Linnik","original_name":"Phillip Linnik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jack Lyman","credit_id":"68913791763439387bf3ea23","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5060200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phillip Linnik","original_name":"Phillip Linnik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68913718b330b85a44a46cba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5060200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phillip Linnik","original_name":"Phillip Linnik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68913732dd344df8c661f633","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
