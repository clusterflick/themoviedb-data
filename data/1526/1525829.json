They come up with an original idea. They transform into an exhausted horse and thus manage to sneak into a mansion, which a rich woman has turned into a luxurious home for all kinds of animals as her hobby. A series of comical situations arise there due to the great attention shown to the comedians — the horse, as an animal. For example, they are served an abundance of the finest hay, which they, of course, eat, marking, etc. The climax occurs in a race between the \"horse\" and the farrier, who wants to shoe it and ends up being shoed himself. But their cunning is discovered and they are rudely thrown out into the street, with the knowledge that they fared better as animals than as people.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1959-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Tail is My Ticket","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1671066,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Boris Kolar","original_name":"Boris Kolar","popularity":0.1054,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68927669a770116addb23b38","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dušan Vukotić","original_name":"Dušan Vukotić","popularity":0.1444,"profile_path":"/ci2TFK7e4m80Oaszfjks13rItIo.jpg","credit_id":"689276724d3806a43af3eff6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dušan Vukotić","original_name":"Dušan Vukotić","popularity":0.1444,"profile_path":"/ci2TFK7e4m80Oaszfjks13rItIo.jpg","credit_id":"6892767b69a19e7081b23750","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0176091","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
