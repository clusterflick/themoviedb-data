A political theorist and prominent African leader, Nkrumah was even featured on the cover of Time magazine in 1953. Nkrumah was later toppled by a military coup in 1966, which was allegedly backed by the CIA, after he was cast as a dictator. As a result, the films made during Nkrumah’s time were ordered to be burned. Though his name is all but erased in the U.S., Nkrumah remains an iconic and revered figure across much of Africa.","popularity":0.1,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":103053,"logo_path":"/gn8WDjyJorOsuEHCtx0VEL8HNGk.png","name":"Breakwater Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":122147,"logo_path":"/eotra9uY7zyivEzDL4bFdn7Elm4.png","name":"Higher Ground","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Eyes of Ghana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2351012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kwame Nkrumah","original_name":"Kwame Nkrumah","popularity":0.1358,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6890f5ce516fc22b0ea46bb0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1802871,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kris Bowers","original_name":"Kris Bowers","popularity":0.5806,"profile_path":"/qL0TnImRmCRIcoQy1d3GjTPKCLn.jpg","credit_id":"6890f4f89655b80a86772724","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Proudfoot","original_name":"Ben Proudfoot","popularity":0.2717,"profile_path":"/9TJozHiBSgzRpG8sdHbgIOe6Nn5.jpg","credit_id":"6890f5024e48d92f2261f47a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Proudfoot","original_name":"Ben Proudfoot","popularity":0.2717,"profile_path":"/9TJozHiBSgzRpG8sdHbgIOe6Nn5.jpg","credit_id":"6890f521649f3f1839b7f4d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3034326,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nana Adwoa Frimpong","original_name":"Nana Adwoa Frimpong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890f53935be685e38b7f791","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anita Afonu","original_name":"Anita Afonu","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890f5453c3e7636b2261ef3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3637827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moses Bwayo","original_name":"Moses Bwayo","popularity":0.0939,"profile_path":"/AbMr3nosJKn6MvJ05KmlenIwvEq.jpg","credit_id":"6890f54cb3419ca7da7cfb46","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barack Obama","original_name":"Barack Obama","popularity":6.7649,"profile_path":"/reEkbvLlNknpCo2I37Vim6XpqGu.jpg","credit_id":"6890f5501095ff5b87b2359c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612423,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brandon Somerhalder","original_name":"Brandon Somerhalder","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890f553b3419ca7da7cfb49","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4908916,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ethan Lewis","original_name":"Ethan Lewis","popularity":0.7628,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890f5654e48d92f2261f483","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1852949,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vinnie Malhotra","original_name":"Vinnie Malhotra","popularity":0.1554,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890f5717e850e6202f3e954","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":964843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Obama","original_name":"Michelle Obama","popularity":4.805,"profile_path":"/aoumtex4PjUmG2sYp3VaLrarmBl.jpg","credit_id":"6890f5717e850e6202f3e957","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
