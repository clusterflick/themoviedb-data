It takes a very simple plot of a young woman’s year abroad at Oxford and somehow turns it into a highly emotional journey—with a good measure of beauty, heartbreak, and self-discovery.  Ella Durran is ambitious and fiercely independent. She wanted to make the best of her scholarship at Oxford before going back home for her blossoming political career. But then she meets Jamie, a charming yet mysterious local with a secret of his own, and suddenly her world takes on shape she never saw coming. Their love story is not about love alone: timing, decisions, and fate play their roles in it.  Very fine and underplayed acting. There was a genuine vulnerability from Ella, and Jamie countered her fiery intensity with his calm strength. The chemistry seemed so real, and that allowed the emotional moments of the story to hit really hard.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"“One year.
