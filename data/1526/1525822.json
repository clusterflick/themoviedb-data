Its historical foundation lies in the person of the gaucho Antonio Mamerto Gil Núñez, who was born around 1840 and died on January 8, 1878. The documentary attempts to explore the paths of popular faith in Gauchito Gil. For the belief to exist, there must be people dedicated to spreading it: life stories that play an active part in building the cult.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":134586,"logo_path":"/eGBMR6E7GQj8NL5LIceTelBfj7j.png","name":"Coruya Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El último refugio: Gauchito Gil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5600646,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pablo Valente","original_name":"Pablo Valente","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68926eb1dca636492a7d00a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5600646,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pablo Valente","original_name":"Pablo Valente","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68926ec0ab9e5621477d02f1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2427896,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leo Chialvo","original_name":"Leo Chialvo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68926ed614709ec0a3b237e8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
