In need of a square meal, the Pilgrim meets and follows a vagrant LARPer,  RATBOY, who is fervently obsessed with an entity called the Floon. The townsfolk are not only all  participating in a town wide LARP campaign, but they all appear to be compulsively partaking in a town  lottery. The pilgrim comes to find that each individual’s lottery ticket is what allows them to participate in  the town’s activities. Without a ticket, one is ostracized from all establishments and events, and like Ratboy,  becomes a Mascota, and townsfolk then consider them to be a subaltern citizen. Mascotas present as half  human/half animal figures, as they have chosen a path whereby they no longer see the difference between  their in-game role-play and their out-of-game persona.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/vbNTcseJPWoPJNTVKkGx7R4MNA1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":270133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parasocial Soft Machine Channel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mascota","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mason Azbill","original_name":"Mason Azbill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Voice Actor","credit_id":"6890e0577324a71e45a46be6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3302485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Connor Davison","original_name":"Connor Davison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Voice Actor","credit_id":"6890e0770667fffd8f7cfb08","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Harrell","original_name":"Holly Harrell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Voice Actor","credit_id":"6890e09ecd114ef50061f653","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Drew Hanks","original_name":"Drew Hanks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Voice Actor","credit_id":"6890e0baab9e5621477cfced","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly McClintock","original_name":"Holly McClintock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Voice Actor","credit_id":"6890e0d845ce31100a11df8f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Misael Jose Oquendo","original_name":"Misael Jose Oquendo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890e0fbab9e5621477cfcfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nico Garcini","original_name":"Nico Garcini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890e10c1584bf6c9f61f671","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nico Garcini","original_name":"Nico Garcini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890e141bb22289fdf61f706","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606444,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nico Garcini","original_name":"Nico Garcini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890e17ae9e976b25cde6fe6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Misael Jose Oquendo","original_name":"Misael Jose Oquendo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890e1c64b0724abe4f3e952","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606445,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Misael Jose Oquendo","original_name":"Misael Jose Oquendo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890e1dc11a9ef4fb77cf9c3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Misael Jose Oquendo","original_name":"Misael Jose Oquendo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6890e1eee9e976b25cde6fe9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vbNTcseJPWoPJNTVKkGx7R4MNA1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MASCOTA (PREVIEW)","key":"Q1UCYMB_zdg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-09-08T07:58:32.000Z","id":"6890df5527936ea2e911e04a"}]}}}
