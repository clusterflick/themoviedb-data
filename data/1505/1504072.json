This portrait is therefore not part of the Cinématon anthology and is, consequently, outside the collection.  In Greek mythology, Artemis, filmed here on the Acropolis in Athens, was the goddess of the hunt, childbirth, and the moon.  Of course, this Cinematon is not a real one, but it gives a fairly precise idea of ​​what the one of the goddess Artemis could have been like if the cinematograph had been invented more than 2000 years earlier!
