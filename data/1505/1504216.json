Toda and Kaneda are, in fact, members of the gang currently being frantically pursued by the Metropolitan Police. Their leader is a ruthless man named Yoshio Matsui, known as \"Tetsu the Murakumo,\" who has his mistress, Aiko, working as a singer at this cabaret. Kaneda, using his leg injury caused by Detective Mishima as leverage, demands a large sum of money from Tetsu, but is instead met with gunfire from Tetsu's gang. Upon hearing the gunshots, Officer Fujita, who was patrolling nearby, gives chase. As Kaneda lies dying, he reveals the truth before drawing his last breath. With this near-confirmation, Fujita puts out an all-points bulletin for Tetsu.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/2QnMrE0uVyx4bjlrYOpbNrbF1pU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1949-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"SHOOTING STAR","title":"Shooting Star","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshiko Yamaguchi","original_name":"山口淑子","popularity":1.0006,"profile_path":"/f9Pdf6P2B0kavM7IFMXPjAETnXL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"原口愛子","credit_id":"685d323f463c3a842c8f12e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Den Obinata","original_name":"大日方傳","popularity":0.3243,"profile_path":"/5vAq0YrLfsIHkrmi2iEEYIYoufP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"藤岡俊作","credit_id":"685d327bdf01f201cf7ec9d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masao Wakahara","original_name":"若原雅夫","popularity":0.2183,"profile_path":"/wkGM18bsd70IuCLZlwkNZleTLMd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"速水恭輔","credit_id":"685d32bd9dc7d1bf9330316f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akira Nakamura","original_name":"中村彰","popularity":0.535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"三島","credit_id":"685d3302921541811d495287","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1612869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chizuko Nogami","original_name":"Chizuko Nogami","popularity":0.1157,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"松井恵美子","credit_id":"685d33297666ed1df24d105a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ichirō Izawa","original_name":"伊沢一郎","popularity":0.4504,"profile_path":"/iWGvVleWHabi8dakmYzDtZjDoqy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"金山","credit_id":"685d3359f03c79e6fa7b3e1e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1628668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miyuki Chiaki","original_name":"千明みゆき","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"ナナ子","credit_id":"685d337ac761d33f718f12e6","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yutaka Abe","original_name":"阿部豊","popularity":0.2989,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685d33f1220764f8da1555cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208310,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kennosuke Tateoka","original_name":"館岡謙之助","popularity":0.2681,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685d3430eee6cb914474471f","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yutaka Abe","original_name":"阿部豊","popularity":0.2989,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685d345b921541811d4952a2","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuo Aoyagi","original_name":"青柳信雄","popularity":0.4568,"profile_path":"/q6AcJqxI4MerBAv6VX6xvBysC2f.jpg","credit_id":"685d355e314ee2736b7ec9e6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1587682,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shin Yamanaka","original_name":"山中 進","popularity":0.0615,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685d3583a51a8f20148054c5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598130,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Seigo Shindo","original_name":"Seigo Shindo","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685d35a2921541811d4952b1","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1529922,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Kaiya Sato","original_name":"Kaiya Sato","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685d35ff10fea39b867b3e53","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1511,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2QnMrE0uVyx4bjlrYOpbNrbF1pU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1949-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
