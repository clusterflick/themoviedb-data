Shapes of blues and greens flow with grace, a feast of rÃªverie for the eye. Wind, water, sun, light, the world dances with the mind. Peace and melancholy sing as everything flows and goes.  Choking on comfort, locked in this world, one can simply waltz with their thoughts. In this ballad of wonders, there's only one way in and no way out. Fragmenting reality, the hues twirl along with the music. This could go on forever.  This is the mind's favorite game. No resisting. Now diving into escapism.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1A0kvp50AY1cC7QK7ZO0wbK9aZq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":266486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Made at the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Escapism...","title":"ESCAPISM","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5531301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oil Pastels","original_name":"Oil Pastels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Wind","credit_id":"685f07211a96c102737b4348","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5531303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Watercolors","original_name":"Watercolors","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The Flow","credit_id":"685f07305209eb903734f74d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5531308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Plastelina","original_name":"Plastelina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The Sun and The Aurora Borealis","credit_id":"685f07727d448999c24d180a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5531281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandrine Champagne","original_name":"Sandrine Champagne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Saying the only line of dialogue in the film : \"ESCAPISM...\"","credit_id":"685f07b59dc7d1bf93303775","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5531281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandrine Champagne","original_name":"Sandrine Champagne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685f05734d7e6fb9cc805a45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5531284,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Sandrine Champagne","original_name":"Sandrine Champagne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685f05915b9de1ee6fdd0cca","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1850521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Eber","original_name":"Sandra Eber","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685f05c5f5cd027b3a228ed3","department":"Crew","job":"Supervisor of Production Resources"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5531292,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Joshua Stewart","original_name":"Joshua Stewart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685f0608d5288746177ed079","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5531295,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tim Horlor","original_name":"Tim Horlor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685f0673223172b18991541f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5531281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandrine Champagne","original_name":"Sandrine Champagne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685f06d7650778ad1a155cfe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uZ0hm921YY82x11OPkHzBhAonzN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/raSYg5vPgaI5DlxN8fHgIJtNYtt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pZozu9sxV2IKxAhRFauit3OgqWQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1A0kvp50AY1cC7QK7ZO0wbK9aZq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4232,"name":"melancholy"},{"id":296721,"name":"experimental animation"},{"id":297442,"name":"animation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
