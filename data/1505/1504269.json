There, she took part in the “Carte du Ciel” — an ambitious international project to map the night sky, earning the early title of “computer” as a result of processing repetitive calculations. Disillusioned with her previous existence, she considers becoming a coder in her next life, amidst the wave of economic optimism awaiting her reincarnation in 1990s Portugal. Shot on 16mm film and smartphone, \"Oh Be a Fine Girl Kiss Me\" blends historical fiction and autobiography in a meditation on life’s choices and constraints, as well as on the systems and categories that shaped modernity.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh Be a Fine Girl Kiss Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Dos Reis","original_name":"Alice Dos Reis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685d50903efa572ede74473b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"https://www.maat.pt/en/event/exhibition-15th-edition-edp-foundation-new-artists-award","release_date":"2025-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
