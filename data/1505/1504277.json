Even if it is only aimed at something that is supposedly lifeless? Tom Dale raises these questions in his work Shot Through. The video begins with a drum set standing in a forest. A shot is heard. And a second. Many others follow. The editing accelerates the destruction of the drums. Through the alternating shots, the viewer witnesses the various facets of the carnage – the explosion of the wood or the denting of metal – and the issue of materiality is shifted into focus. After the hail of bullets has ceased, closeups are shown of the drum, which has been shot to pieces. Comparisons to a gutted corpse are deliberate, and the drums transformed from a thing into animal-like creatures. The forest setting is reminiscent of a hunting scene, although it is alienated from the ethics of hunting and instead portrays the execution of the objects.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shot Through","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5528914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Dale","original_name":"Tom Dale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685d55ecf37560c0f7805574","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10583,"name":"performance art"},{"id":354251,"name":"wholphin"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
