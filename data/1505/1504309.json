Crooks dissects a moment recorded with his camera and digitally stitches the scene back together in a way that warps the linearity of the sequence. These works render reality abstract and redefine our perception of time and space in unexpected and mesmerizing ways.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pan no. 2 (One step forward, one frame backwards)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Crooks","original_name":"Daniel Crooks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685d5ded717dcc59577447cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
