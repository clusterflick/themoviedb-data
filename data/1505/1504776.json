Wound Edges is my emotional response to this landscape, filmed on 16mm and hand-developed with the forest’s ashes. Each frame carries physical traces of the land’s memory, blending destruction with resilience. The soundscape—field recordings, burned wood, contact microphones on trees, and the presence of fire—echoes the forest’s wounds. A reflection on human impact, impermanence, and the haunting beauty of transformation.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/8oU5iaboHl7VBHK4LCbIloJc9GG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The wound edges","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2755031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yannick Mosimann","original_name":"Yannick Mosimann","popularity":0.1103,"profile_path":"/zdvNJoIBHFAVqM76iq8AruG4ZP5.jpg","credit_id":"685eac53acc26b00d0dd0b62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8oU5iaboHl7VBHK4LCbIloJc9GG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":191404,"name":"forest fire"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"},{"id":315517,"name":"16mm film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
