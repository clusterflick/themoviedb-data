Escaping her dorm room, she finds herself lost in a memory with her mother and an ice cream cone. Navigating the emotions of an outsider, this poem/screenplay hybrid documents the typical, yet rarely displayed remoteness of college life. The abrupt turn at the end leaves the viewer questioning their associations with anger, savagery, and our national gun violence crisis.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"What happens beyond the Veterans of Foreign Wars?","title":"Veterans of Foreign Wars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
