He's currently sitting, in his run-down motel room, sipping Jack Daniels and popping Anti- Psychotics like they’re skittles while staring at the walls dedicated to capturing The “BABYLON BUTCHER”. The Butcher has claimed another victim, and P.K.’s 7-year search has him no closer to finding the elusive serial killer responsible for his wife’s death. But believe it or not, he has more immediate problems. His current girlfriend CHINA WHITE is ranting about his emotional unavailability. To make matters worse his Schizophrenic hallucinations won't stop pestering him to take on a new case.\r Street Credit is Hip-Hop Noir tale where mental illness, LA Gangs, #metoo movement, “coked-out” cops and genocidal, government conspiracies collide.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/y47eHe2Y56hMvySSuRQOc5wxLkK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":266361,"logo_path":null,"name":"Randolph Street Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":266362,"logo_path":null,"name":"Love Struck Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Hood has a Hero","title":"Street Credit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1195601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niki Botelho","original_name":"Niki Botelho","popularity":0.3278,"profile_path":"/mmKd3BBIgOG5ICbw2eIq2NAPWEy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lu","credit_id":"685d42edcec9a0e2ff8054e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4805996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamal Henderson","original_name":"Jamal Henderson","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Shaun","credit_id":"685d431ef37a925ad6495229","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2356114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamy D.
