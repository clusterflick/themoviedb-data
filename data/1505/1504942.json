The events of the play discussed social issues within a family consisting of a father with his three children in addition to their uncle (the brother of their deceased mother), where the plot revolved around the children's attempt to lure the sympathy of their miserly authoritarian father in order to extend a helping hand and help with financial disbursement. She revealed the state of miserliness inherent in some members of society, as the father was characterized in the play by extreme stinginess that resulted in extreme poverty for his children, as they lived with cut water and in a room not exceeding two meters, and lacked the most basic rights as he collected clothes for them from containers.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/9C3rF7b9QVaCTsnCcafo1aZ4mcq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stingy Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SA","title":"Kahtoot","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5531822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maher Hassan Al Ghanim","original_name":"Maher Hassan Al Ghanim","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zwusWZiyKAIBnzj6QxRFjWA22gW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"685f6ab056bd33888f303791","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5531822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maher Hassan Al Ghanim","original_name":"Maher Hassan Al Ghanim","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zwusWZiyKAIBnzj6QxRFjWA22gW.jpg","credit_id":"685f85b294dd819c73dd0e59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xmfxXvXT9T5yYbhI9KmPFugGEbL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9C3rF7b9QVaCTsnCcafo1aZ4mcq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
