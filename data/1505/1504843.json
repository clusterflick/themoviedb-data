The central part of each section of the film is based on a transcription of a Bach composition for two voices. The two screens underscore this paradigm insofar as one is always the simultaneous reflection of the visual development of the other, regardless of the position of the reels (left or right): a visual representation of the inversion technique of a theme that is often used in music. The use of mirroring deliberately side-steps the question of the reality of representation. It no longer has any importance, now that weâ€™re in the domain of the reflected image, of imitation. The two images reflect one another in a constant back and forth, mimicking to a certain extent the development of the (fake) pans that comprise the film. The pans metaphorically evoke, if only superficially, the keyboard.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RR","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2013794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yann Beauvais","original_name":"Yann Beauvais","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/jTAHhdTQziEGqydwy6537mNSPiw.jpg","credit_id":"685ece62ee3207f5de7b4366","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
