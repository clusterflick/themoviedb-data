Among them are a painter, a businessman, an electrician, a waiter, an army doctor, an actor, a prince, a gypsy, a Jew. None of them know why they were locked up, they can only guess. The most plausible version is that the Jews were deported to concentration camps in Germany. Some believe it, others don't. Waiting to be interrogated, they talk about the political situation, faith, the impact of Nazi propaganda, power, logic, innocence, guilt, illusions, death, racial discrimination, indifference, hope, the possibility of escape, their individual situation, their lives. They try to develop their own survival techniques in theory.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":59873,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magyar
