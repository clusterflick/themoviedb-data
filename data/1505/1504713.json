After the rediscovery of Moi syn in Buenos Aires in 2008, Cherviakov‘s silent films became The Holy Grail of Soviet cinema: his 1927 debut film Devushka s dalëkoj reki (The Girl from a Far River) now tops the rating of most wanted Russian and Soviet films.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moj Syn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
