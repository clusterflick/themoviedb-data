Using a press, he compresses what they find and pours it into resin to form ‚G-Cubes’. He then takes the garbage back as art to the people who created it – consumers in industrialized countries. Nothing on the journey goes exactly as planned, however, and Reichenbach finds himself teetering between art and activism.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/umSfPuPFkLRiJiTtSaW0ldqWdaE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97382,"logo_path":null,"name":"DokLab
