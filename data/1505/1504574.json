Buck, Wilma and Duke Denton fly to the distant planet of the food's origin, Vistula. They seek to track down a slave trader named Kaleel, who is collaborating with the planet's governor. While on the planet Vistula, they find that Kaleel has been building a fleet of attack ships in secret, and plans to use them against Earth's weakened defense forces. With Earth's defense force now heavily outnumbered 10-to-1, Buck decides that he must destroy the attack fleet and rescue Wilma, who has become trapped in Kaleel's mountain fortress.  It originally aired as a 120-minute episode, but has been formatted as two 60-minute episodes in most subsequent re-airings for scheduling reasons. While many guides list it as a two-parter, its initial airing and release on DVD as one double-length episode should make this the official recognition.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/e1DpJ3eTL3eDFFfRv8SzT7l7iQB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: Planet of the Slave Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gil Gerard","original_name":"Gil Gerard","popularity":0.6483,"profile_path":"/uNbHz1JkwdTE9JL4D8ZGHStGukZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Buck Rogers","credit_id":"685e049eeee6cb914474499c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erin Gray","original_name":"Erin Gray","popularity":0.8992,"profile_path":"/5EKbWSPCXfSNL7FwkXTuZ2xMcq5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Colonel Wilma Deering","credit_id":"685e04bb1b17b27ae230344f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":158936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim O'Connor","original_name":"Tim O'Connor","popularity":0.5819,"profile_path":"/4FsaltnDl3kDCYR5VTHE2LKnKig.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr Elias Huer","credit_id":"685e04e01c1e4647a0155974","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Groh","original_name":"David Groh","popularity":0.6538,"profile_path":"/wQ12YJHNK3R7iZLVuZ4Z3Bq40yU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Major Duke Danton","credit_id":"685e0513d9ac3beb4b30341d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roddy McDowall","original_name":"Roddy McDowall","popularity":2.2248,"profile_path":"/mGO0pDPi5p91k2Og09HTf270rxL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Governor Saroyan","credit_id":"685e0547e33c230f71744a12","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Palance","original_name":"Jack Palance","popularity":1.8533,"profile_path":"/fna5JPJcX6JnDDzpIypAYP8a3Mk.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kaleel","credit_id":"685e0569cf7d002a0a7ecbee","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buster Crabbe","original_name":"Buster Crabbe","popularity":0.2949,"profile_path":"/1spocNgJFavXTuXXTu1PvRf3A5d.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Brigadier Gordon","credit_id":"685e059babc67ee15a744959","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Carlson","original_name":"Karen Carlson","popularity":0.493,"profile_path":"/t5fT7xm6rO9PpanXztEhafVxlUY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Stella Warden","credit_id":"685e05d149eec21f0ab9acca","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":152578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Caffey","original_name":"Michael Caffey","popularity":0.1416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685e06122334bf8c607b4028","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1329,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e1DpJ3eTL3eDFFfRv8SzT7l7iQB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":886}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
