Filmed over two years across the Midwest, it follows veteran promoter David Herro as he pours everything into keeping his wrestling promotion alive—not for fame or fortune, but to build a future for his son Kal. As Kal steps into the ring to forge his own identity, the story becomes a heartfelt portrait of legacy, love, and the unspoken sacrifices made to help the next generation rise. At its core, this is a story about family, devotion, and the fight to pass on something that truly matters.","popularity":0.1143,"poster_path":"/3umQEyfDRMRQPTqUsIJOmMXSg26.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":266473,"logo_path":null,"name":"Under The L Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"BEHIND EVERY SUPERSTAR, THERE'S A HERRO","title":"The Herro's Journey: A Pro Wrestling Story","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Herro","original_name":"David Herro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"David Herro","credit_id":"685eda30fd007c79b8155c06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kal Herro","original_name":"Kal Herro","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kal Herro","credit_id":"685eda3b14bb27bb64744d22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Sarven","original_name":"Allen Sarven","popularity":0.4551,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Al Snow","credit_id":"685eda4bb75319a1064d1711","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1506026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Scherr","original_name":"Adam Scherr","popularity":0.2217,"profile_path":"/fJeSMSNiV88yuIYECN2Zl6Sw3eA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Braun Stroman","credit_id":"685eda59650778ad1a155c60","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Foley","original_name":"Mick Foley","popularity":0.6763,"profile_path":"/u5ibrKCxOVgEmsz8oAIq4mRErCx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mick Foley","credit_id":"685eda663856c386844d159b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5530938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Vox Mullen","original_name":"David Vox Mullen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"David Vox Mullen","credit_id":"685eda78997001dd864d1887","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1200233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Basham","original_name":"Doug Basham","popularity":0.1011,"profile_path":"/zPSoII0kN72PzLwcYoZpkSKxo2v.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Doug Basham","credit_id":"685edaa15932c048507ecda0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Cardona","original_name":"Matthew Cardona","popularity":0.1919,"profile_path":"/vvvlLJBvbeaO7r8PU9wPslA9p3M.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Matthew Cardona","credit_id":"685edab1177518583e80593a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Hutter","original_name":"Michael Hutter","popularity":0.155,"profile_path":"/tf2zGCOLrqIFm9Fas0zX2VigSGJ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"EC3","credit_id":"685edac014bb27bb64744d2b","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5530945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Drey Richards","original_name":"Drey Richards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685edb353a418b6dde7ecee2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5530938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Vox Mullen","original_name":"David Vox Mullen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685edb457666ed1df24d15f2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36934471","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3umQEyfDRMRQPTqUsIJOmMXSg26.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
