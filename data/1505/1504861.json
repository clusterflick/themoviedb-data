Their soulful gaze wins hearts and fuels their lasting popularity. Once royal hunting dogs, they now take on unusual jobs—like Strolchi, a miniature dachshund who sniffs out woodworm in historic buildings. The bond between humans and dachshunds goes back to Celtic times. Archaeologists have even found joint burials of people and dachshund-like dogs. Versatile and charming, they thrive as city pets, hunting companions, and even racers—like those at the annual Wiener Race in Kirchheimbolanden. Beloved far beyond Germany, dachshunds have fans in France too, with events like Paris’s “Sausage Walk.”","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/zeVWEzVMryzDZiejwIiAJ9cD2t7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85200,"logo_path":null,"name":"IFAGE Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":11237,"logo_path":"/nzPEges9ftjCDQWru0qrIfTX8OR.png","name":"ZDF/Arte","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Dackel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5530939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Wronka","original_name":"Oliver Wronka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"685eda81c066a494c134f563","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4350020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pia Schädel","original_name":"Pia Schädel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685ed6b58ead6143a2915395","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4350020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pia Schädel","original_name":"Pia Schädel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685eda07c8827b4c398058b1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2371558,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexander Hein","original_name":"Alexander Hein","popularity":0.0356,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685eda44c066a494c134f559","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5530942,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jörg Becker","original_name":"Jörg Becker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685edac43a6b2dfb944d1788","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37443863","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/vwCtWINeoajsGNmvRftJCDYgEms.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kHfcXzs0Hcneb5SlZftN32BLPpZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mlchmkcZrvBlq0Hla9CvuQ0lrX4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ixl6JLDPemt4MgeAVMrTRSYUI6Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/zeVWEzVMryzDZiejwIiAJ9cD2t7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hFJ4lo7eHmqkuCSQMdQecmgzt9G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
