He has no drive, ambition or potential. After a night of drinking, he accidentally kills himself in a bizarre sexual experiment gone wrong.  Michael finds himself in Purgatory and is “greeted” by SHANNI SMITH, a sassy secretary with a high opinion of herself and a low tolerance for everyone else and MARTHA MAGDALENE, a no-nonsense Human Resources manager. After they give Michael a very unwelcoming welcome, he meets with the recently demoted ST. PETER and is told that despite being a decent guy, his wasted potential and laziness is the reason he has been sentenced to Purgatory.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Undesirables","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457109,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Pepitone","original_name":"Joseph Pepitone","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ebe3a628723c01643eabbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457109,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Pepitone","original_name":"Joseph Pepitone","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ebe3ac944a570164be0f08","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
