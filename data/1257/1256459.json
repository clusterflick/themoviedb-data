It’s called “Northern Minnesota’s Labor Wars.”  The years 1916 and 1917 brought major labor uprisings in the mines of the Mesabi Iron Range and the lumber camps of the state’s far northern pine forests. These events not only shaped local history, but became vital turning points in the national and international labor movement.","popularity":0.4083,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":218338,"logo_path":null,"name":"Minnesota Historical Society","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Northern Minnesota's Labor Wars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pam Brunfelt","original_name":"Pam Brunfelt","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"65ebf193eec4f3016373f5b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Brown","original_name":"Aaron Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"65ebf1bd028420017d3f521c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saku Pinta","original_name":"Saku Pinta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"65ebf1cfeec4f3014973c5a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581396,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Kaunonen","original_name":"Gary Kaunonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"65ebf1e1d7cd060185d5e36e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Scorich","original_name":"Jason Scorich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"65ebf20358361b01875af0fe","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allyse Freeman","original_name":"Allyse Freeman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"65ebf21328723c01873f1043","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Welter","original_name":"Christopher Welter","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"65ebf21ceec4f3014973c61b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecelia Wattles-McKeig","original_name":"Cecelia Wattles-McKeig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"65ebf228eec4f3016373f706","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Dvorak","original_name":"Judy Dvorak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"65ebf23358361b01635aace5","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shannon Murray","original_name":"Shannon Murray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"65ebf24228723c01873f10fe","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Walls, Jr.","original_name":"Robert Walls, Jr.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"65ebf24eb7d352017be54921","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Holden","original_name":"Mike Holden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"65ebf257944a570187be6a61","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Schwartz","original_name":"Joe Schwartz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"","credit_id":"65ebf26c9a643501852d303c","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581396,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Kaunonen","original_name":"Gary Kaunonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ebeec828723c01643eb5d8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581396,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Kaunonen","original_name":"Gary Kaunonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ebeff728723c01873f0926","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581396,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Kaunonen","original_name":"Gary Kaunonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ebf03bb7d3520162e4f212","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581396,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Kaunonen","original_name":"Gary Kaunonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ebf066eec4f3014973c3ee","department":"Camera","job":"Videojournalist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4581401,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"A.
