A splitboard is a snowboard that splits in half and allows the snowboarder to cross-country ski into the mountains. You then put the board back together and ride down. Snowboarding in the backcountry is an entirely different sport than snowboarding at a resort. A rider gets only a fraction of the runs because they have to earn every foot of ascent. But when taking on these extra challenges ones could be rewarded with the best deep-powder snowboarding that nature has to offer; you won't find these conditions at a ski resort. Alex Maier has been snowboarding his whole life, but that was in the midwest. When he moves to Montana he has to start from scratch, this series shows what it takes to get into the backcountry safely and effectively.","popularity":0.4507,"poster_path":"/ffQu6plF9TzkD6SZSC8BJZZ7Ci3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wilderness Mindset","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Learning to Splitboard the Northern Rockies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3946375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Maier","original_name":"Alex Maier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65eaf1e5a2423201613391c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30136600","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ffQu6plF9TzkD6SZSC8BJZZ7Ci3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":680,"name":"montana"},{"id":2006,"name":"extreme sports"},{"id":3522,"name":"snowboarding"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":296168,"name":"colorado rockies"},{"id":315866,"name":"extrem snowboarding"},{"id":329736,"name":"splitboarding"},{"id":329737,"name":"splitboard"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
