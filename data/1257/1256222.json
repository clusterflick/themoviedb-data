There were 258 of them: almost every one was wounded, every second was seriously injured, and every fifth died on the front line during filming. They did not just have to face the horrors of war, they were able to find the strength to learn how to work in this new cruel reality. They were able, at the cost of their own lives, to capture on film and pass on to the future generation the heroic feat of the entire Soviet people.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exposure of War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4580441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Sidorenko","original_name":"Vladimir Sidorenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65eb5c28a284eb0163b9cf61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
