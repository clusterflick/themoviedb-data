I didn’t realize “unauthorized” meant they couldn’t use any actual GNR music in the documentary. I just thought it meant the stories would be salacious and the history shocking. I was crestfallen when I realized this 3 hour documentary about Appetite for Destruction wouldn’t actually contain any actual songs from the album! I became curious though: Who makes the vaguely familiar sounding but license-free music in the background of these unauthorized music history films? Thanks to the resources I’ve acquired from QITK, I tracked down and interviewed the most prolific license free stock music makers in the history of unauthorized music docs, and made a doc about them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"UNAUTHORIZED: The Authorized Story of Pastichè","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
