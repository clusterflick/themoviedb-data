The artist follows one of the cheetahs from the perspective of a follower, intuitively and visually connecting the traces of movement in the wilderness. The body image is used as a means of creation to extend the habitat of the animals beyond the frame. In this way, the cycle of \"life and death\" is explored, thus visually touching the traces of the fate of wild animals.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Part of...Olonyok","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4579908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ye Jingle","original_name":"Ye Jingle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65eb16ee66751d0186adf047","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Chiayi International Art Doc Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
