A selection of funny situations and attractions with elements of the absurd. The heads stand in a row, like houses along the street. Characters, objects and other entities penetrate inside the head houses and organize various actions there, changing themselves or changing the heads. Some scenes are played out inside the head. Part - from the outside - in the panorama along the street. Passers-by and guests in houses are the essence of thoughts or feelings. The brain or eyes are the inhabitants.","popularity":0.0805,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":140628,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jupiter-XXI","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Нечётная сторона голов","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Нечетная сторона голов","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Nechetnaya storona golov","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Nechyotnaya storona golov","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Maximov","original_name":"Ivan Maximov","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/3ARdCK9KVqtDgt1QS0O4vLKnGDN.jpg","credit_id":"65ec9cec8fdda901498243a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Open Russian Festival of Animated Film","release_date":"2024-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
