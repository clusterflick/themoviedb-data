Рождение романа","overview":"The White Guard is the first novel by Mikhail Afanasyevich Bulgakov. It describes the events of the Civil War in Ukraine in 1918-1919. The work was conceived by the author as a large-scale trilogy about the civil war, but the author wrote only the first part of it. Confirmation that Bulgakov worked on the second and third parts of the novel are the stories \"The Raid\", \"On the Night of the Third Number\", \"I Killed\" and others. The film is dedicated to the centenary of the writing of the novel \"The White Guard\", to the centenary of the civil war in Russia. This is an attempt to analyze the scale of the historical tragedy through the prism of the views of a great artist.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"\"The White Guard\": Birth of a Novel","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"БЕЛАЯ ГВАРДИЯ РОЖДЕНИЕ РОМАНА","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2028718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirill Zakharov","original_name":"Kirill Zakharov","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65eb3a34bdc34c0161885dc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
