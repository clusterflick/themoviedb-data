The movement was created while playing an audio recording of Art Garfunkel rambling on during a studio session (hence the name \"Art in Session\"). Gein and Soomi repeated this improvisation about 10 times. This is the 6th take. It's one shot, hand held Canon HFG10. Music was later layered on by guitarist and composer Adam Rogers.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art In Session 6","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3930886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soomi Kim","original_name":"Soomi Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f353f4a67254007de9a2c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
