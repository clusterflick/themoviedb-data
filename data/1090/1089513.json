Rossetti, a painting student at the Royal Academy, works with Everett, a child prodigy at the academy, and Will, a classmate, under the name of Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in order to break through the old view of art. Rossetti, who worships the poet Dante and seeks the ideal woman \"Beatrice\" in the book \"Newborn,\" falls in love with Lizzie, who works at a hat shop, and begins to paint her.  At one point, Rossetti was fascinated by actress Jane in the playhouse and asked her to model. The high praise of the painting made Rossetti gradually engrossed in Jane.  A challenging musical work that depicts the love-hate swirling human pattern until his masterpiece \"Beata Beatrix\" was created, approaching the human-like turbulent life of Rossetti, a painter and poet. The following work will also be director Kumakura Asuka's Takarazuka Bow Hall debut work.","popularity":0.1999,"poster_path":"/dI7l6qv2TQg26omPRt86derUXzd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Takarazuka Revue Productions","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beata Beatrix","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3518935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shin Kiwami","original_name":"Kiwami Shin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/tFnTje207WEleWK24czsWEjgDP8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dante Gabriel Rossetti","credit_id":"63f3ccb7a24c5000a13dd062","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3931550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Honoka Kozakura","original_name":"小桜ほのか","popularity":0.1565,"profile_path":"/nImzMKUyuoWHyEvJXNdeJBL2tBB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Siddal","credit_id":"63f3ccddcaaca2007f5fb41e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3931602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kumakura Asuka","original_name":"Kumakura Asuka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f3cd264a4bfc0096392072","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rVOdZtJcG9xMa1dj7PpO2TgI51v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dI7l6qv2TQg26omPRt86derUXzd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"},{"id":291486,"name":"star troupe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
