Their way leads them along mystic places, holy locations and to the most holy of all mountains, to the Kailash in the west of Tibet. During their journey on foot, they meet Dhamis (oracles) and shaman priests; together they form a mixed group of most contrary characters. Hardly anyone knows that the Bon religion is not only completely different from Buddhism but also much older.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1oDJbeeVRVxlZszh7ajXsyLyept.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"}],"release_date":"2003-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Search of Zhang Zhung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2915882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Gabbay","original_name":"Alex Gabbay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f386bca672540082041519","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4985170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas L.
