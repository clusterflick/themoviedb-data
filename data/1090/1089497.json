The musical pieces are then assembled in sequence (as an \"album\"), which is then the basis or groundwork for a film.

Our flesh is divided as we move along; dissociated from the humble origins. Blotted out; looking for freedom in friction. This is beyond good and evil, and asexuality is also a sexuality for all we know.

Sweet life of death – incentive of all incentives.
