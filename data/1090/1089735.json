Art and drama were the major therapeutic tools, along with music, movement, poetry, and filmmaking. The varied expressive modalities are demonstrated in this film, as well as the different roles the therapists played in facilitating the group process. In addition to telling the story of the group, this film also includes detailed case studies of two of the members. It is a rare example of multimodality group therapy unfolding over time.","popularity":1.0432,"poster_path":"/sKJXccxYGa6tI3mLBv9jwbyUmzM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193955,"logo_path":null,"name":"Audio Video Services of Western Psychiatric Hospital","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Green Creature Within","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Art and Drama in Group Psychotherapy","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3932187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judith A.
