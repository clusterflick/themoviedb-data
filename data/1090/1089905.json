In 1992, with the Bosnian War raging, thousands of Bosnians sought refuge in America. Chosen because of its affordable housing and available jobs, a large number of those Bosnians ended up in St. Louis, Missouri. Once there, they began assimilating, starting their own businesses, and transforming a once dilapidated neighborhood into a thriving \"Little Bosnia.\" Over the ensuing three decades, an estimated 70,000 Bosnians have migrated to St. Louis, making it the most inhabited area for Bosnians outside of Bosnia itself. A New Home tells the story of these refugees' perseverance and determination to not only start life over but prosper. â€” Joseph
