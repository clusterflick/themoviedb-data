Ronit’s got an aching crush for Mike and doesn’t know if it’s too late, and Brennan is baffled by that fuzzy feeling all together. A coming-of-age story about masculinity between immigrants. It’s intimate, it’s a little out of their comfort zones, but inevitably, it ends in love.","popularity":0.0899,"poster_path":"/c0uceW210J2ZBFwxu9SBb3EtMcU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Catching feelings, skateboards and karmic netballs.","title":"Shoot Your Shot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dillon Mitra","original_name":"Dillon Mitra","popularity":0.1371,"profile_path":"/s98iBO65B5NcAjDBJwBO5Wkrfme.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63f4e1defbe36f00d4c6d87a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2067102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lance West","original_name":"Lance West","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63f4e1e7524978007cb998f4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3932601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonny Mihajlovic-Drake","original_name":"Sonny Mihajlovic-Drake","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63f4e1f515376c007819f176","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3932603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Brown","original_name":"Arthur Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63f4e20a6f97460089228179","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3932605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonah Mayor","original_name":"Jonah Mayor","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63f4e2136f974600d458dc9c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3932606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thea Miller","original_name":"Thea Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63f4e21d15376c00b1f03e5d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matty Noble","original_name":"Matty Noble","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63f4e22fa24c501316f0cf70","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3932598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mishaal Memon","original_name":"Mishaal Memon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f4e1d1a24c5012e79ae736","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt24081470","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c0uceW210J2ZBFwxu9SBb3EtMcU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
