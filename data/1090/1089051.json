Named after the destructive tornado outbreak that devastated Selma, Alabama on January 12, 2023 and  prior to entering the Atlantic Ocean. This is dedicated to the people of Selma and states east and southeast of Texas who suffer tornadoes from these spawned storms. Europe and Asia still calls the devastating storms that they are currently experiencing \"natural disasters\", which is far from the truth when you understand the perpetual storms being spawned from the United States. If this movie is ever translated into foreign languages, the people of Europe and Asia could get a better understanding of what is causing their environmental chaos. This is a PowerPoint movie that is being updated as Perpetual Storm Selma continues its Northern Hemisphere circumnavigation.
