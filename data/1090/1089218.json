While his hawkish foreign policy and \"Abenomics\" economic policies won him support, he also attracted public attention for his controversial words, actions and scandals. Nobusuke Kishi, a politician and the maternal grandfather of former Prime Minister Abe, was nicknamed the \"Monster of the Showa Era\" for his ability to manipulate the political and business worlds by walking the fronts and backs of society.  The film explores the mysteries of his blood and upbringing that led him to adopt an extremely \"forward-looking\" political stance in order to realize his ambitions, which were imprinted in his childhood mind as his \"grandfather's teachings\". With black humor and satirical picture books, the film unravels who former Prime Minister Abe was and what he left behind for this country.","popularity":0.187,"poster_path":"/4dMwkF6og64X1E7qg1KCpJ0BX73.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90125,"logo_path":"/6COYB4aAdczDJ04IfS2DsZEjBUu.png","name":"STAR SANDS","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2023-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grandson of a Monster","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Yôkai no Mago","type":"Romaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2009997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinzo Abe","original_name":"Shinzo Abe","popularity":0.2511,"profile_path":"/zcYcULiTCNiA3juxwb08ALrpyOr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6542ea8fa58902012e45d1ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3223254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshihide Suga","original_name":"Yoshihide Suga","popularity":0.1677,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6542eaa16beaea00eaf5d3c4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4352329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eito Suzuki","original_name":"Eito Suzuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6542eacd1365450120edfab4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4352331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Fackler","original_name":"Martin Fackler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6542eadf9cc67b00df91686e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1014996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanji Furutachi","original_name":"古舘寛治","popularity":0.389,"profile_path":"/lDhhTMzBlR9v5XbjOmfilG0PaFj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6542eb9d41a56100acfc7877","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63693,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Taro Iwashiro","original_name":"岩代太郎","popularity":0.2284,"profile_path":"/lQW66ngjWvhsjX0tylElltR9C66.jpg","credit_id":"6542eb240bc5290100d7f40d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4352343,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shigeaki Koga","original_name":"Shigeaki Koga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6542ebfc2866fa00c4221e79","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4352348,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Benpi Neko","original_name":"Benpi Neko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6542ec5db09bde013c3f9631","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2498034,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mitsunobu Kawamura","original_name":"河村光庸","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/n29qDlD2OP19R0MKpnTpbVC2Ece.jpg","credit_id":"6542ecebb09bde00afd866be","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3930604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taketo Uchiyama","original_name":"Taketo Uchiyama","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f2eea1caaca20085783e85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2498034,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mitsunobu Kawamura","original_name":"河村光庸","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/n29qDlD2OP19R0MKpnTpbVC2Ece.jpg","credit_id":"63f2f0b4caaca200b9f67515","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26543725","wikidata_id":"Q120333119","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"youkai_mago"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/omj89KWQORJQxg2Rp0b4dAOZsAD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/4dMwkF6og64X1E7qg1KCpJ0BX73.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2187,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/ijl8rk5b01mDFmUg4efUEb0R8Sm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1548}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":277112,"name":"japanese politics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"『妖怪の孫』特報　 2023年3月17日(金)公開","key":"ZFVJtZdfUoI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":true,"published_at":"2023-01-30T04:00:18.000Z","id":"63f2ef4fa6725400c9f38c73"}]}}}
