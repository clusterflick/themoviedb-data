Zbigniew Burzyński (1902-1971) is the pioneer of ballooning in Poland, a balloon constructor and double winner of the Gordon Cup – the International Ballooning Competition. In the 1960s, he tried to reactivate the discipline, for example in Czechoslovakia. A balloon flight with Burzyński and his wife became a great opportunity to take picturesque shots of the Polish landscape from a bird's eye view. From the ground, soldiers, farmers and children send greetings to the couple. The human world seems to be idyllic. It looks like a part of the greater world order, friendly to those who dared to soar up.","popularity":0.0821,"poster_path":"/pq2dWlT3shneQbsLiN2zIvXm3am.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wytwórnia Filmów Dokumentalnych","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Walk in the Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Walk in the Clouds","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139023,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janusz Kidawa","original_name":"Janusz Kidawa","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f3a0ae524978009e78cebf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139023,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janusz Kidawa","original_name":"Janusz Kidawa","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6493f6a96b5fc200ad8d8427","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1486953,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zygmunt Samosiuk","original_name":"Zygmunt Samosiuk","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/uwEnS7pawWJkSDQq4IsmExs1ivj.jpg","credit_id":"6493f6c889b561011c9c3a7b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4124476,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Janusz Kuźniarski","original_name":"Janusz Kuźniarski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6493f7216b5fc200ad8d846a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":586492,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Agnieszka Bojanowska","original_name":"Agnieszka Bojanowska","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6493f7349a358d00c596551d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135537,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jerzy Maksymiuk","original_name":"Jerzy Maksymiuk","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/3PXmRRtFoH7WQNdO0GHvDZrE30z.jpg","credit_id":"6493f7436b5fc200e9cd337c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pq2dWlT3shneQbsLiN2zIvXm3am.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
