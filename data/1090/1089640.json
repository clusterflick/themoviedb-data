Using expressive images of everyday racism, the film tells the story of a German family with a black mother and a white father who work as theatre actresses and directors - and their process of reflection on the fact that even in a family marked by diversity, subliminal and obvious racism is omnipresent. A call to acknowledge one's own racisms and to question the structural inequality that still persists.","popularity":0.0917,"poster_path":"/wCR8Nx3wl0uo6ii82ywdUjLe5I4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schweigemahl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2297173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Kotthaus","original_name":"Peter Kotthaus","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Stefan","credit_id":"63f4200e524978007cb92eff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1858621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Sleegers","original_name":"Rebecca Sleegers","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"63f4202aa3491100d4d5f8f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3931939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amadin Omorodion","original_name":"Amadin Omorodion","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Manuel","credit_id":"63f42058a6725400865eaec3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3931941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Amelie Eckert","original_name":"Valentina Amelie Eckert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Emilie","credit_id":"63f420745249780096437361","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1367862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Schramm","original_name":"Anne Schramm","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f41f6415376c0083377c04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3931934,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Horst Wegener","original_name":"Horst Wegener","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f41f78caaca2007f5fe55f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3931934,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Horst Wegener","original_name":"Horst Wegener","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f41f8fa349110085ffbc73","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1919699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Bülow","original_name":"Lisa Bülow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f41f9f4a4bfc00f07e90d1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1367862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Schramm","original_name":"Anne Schramm","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f41fca5249780096437292","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":776,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wCR8Nx3wl0uo6ii82ywdUjLe5I4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
