Like most serials in the '50s, Riding with Buffalo Bill consisted of quite a bit of budget-stretching stock footage telling a highly fictionalized account of Buffalo Bill Cody aiding a group of ranchers in their defeat of a local crime lord. The serial's assistant director, Leonard Katzman, later produced the long-running television series Gunsmoke and Dallas.","popularity":1.2032,"poster_path":"/gcGD3JXlrPUlFKy8kBf6hWEC351.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Make Way For The Greatest Plainsman In History!","title":"Riding with Buffalo Bill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Reed","original_name":"Marshall Reed","popularity":0.2182,"profile_path":"/kMniZFRQRqC1znX5sH9SdjUr2Yy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bill Cody, aka The Riding' Terror","credit_id":"5588749e9251416fa1000f7d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Vallin","original_name":"Rick Vallin","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":"/7dMOEKv7uTCH6GzjCZbrod1h7qr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Reb Morgan","credit_id":"558874a6c3a3680545000dbc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1480466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanne Rio","original_name":"Joanne Rio","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Maria Perez [ch 7-11, 14-15]","credit_id":"558874adc3a3680531000e53","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1480467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley Whitney","original_name":"Shirley Whitney","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ruth Morgan","credit_id":"558874b59251416fb2000f09","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Ingram","original_name":"Jack Ingram","popularity":0.3212,"profile_path":"/kspyAwF8bw1FFEzYaERCtfkBHSZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Henchman Ace","credit_id":"5720835f92514121f0001f21","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Fawcett","original_name":"William Fawcett","popularity":0.4211,"profile_path":"/ep0wJtC7nwKs2QUoPIWPD77zVxO.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Rocky Ford","credit_id":"574a6675c3a36830240022dc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregg Barton","original_name":"Gregg Barton","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/tX7s7D1M06mujjiEuvHSImSwIiG.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Henchman Bart","credit_id":"574a6685c3a3682fd6001adb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Coch","original_name":"Edward Coch","popularity":0.0694,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Jose Perez [ch 7-11, 14-15] (as Ed Coch)","credit_id":"574a6695c3a36864da0000ba","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":83915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Ritch","original_name":"Steven Ritch","popularity":0.1916,"profile_path":"/4I4QysMOzrprCbKwnCk9xvVqu3i.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Henchman Elko [ch 5] (as Steve Ritch)","credit_id":"574a66a4c3a36802f600153b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierce Lyden","original_name":"Pierce Lyden","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/vmWNPkFmkMUJIQLaVaoQhpuG1bP.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Henchman Darr","credit_id":"574a66acc3a36849ae00047f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Fox","original_name":"Michael Fox","popularity":0.5306,"profile_path":"/gDdahoYRHFJsCQ0wvnGjm8DvDtZ.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"King Carney","credit_id":"574a66c1c3a36853f500030d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Roberts","original_name":"Lee Roberts","popularity":0.1704,"profile_path":"/p1zmGLrCDh5H9wlgYbOsUkIWUax.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Zeke","credit_id":"5889209ec3a3683e7400d091","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Spencer Gordon Bennet","original_name":"Spencer Gordon Bennet","popularity":0.4206,"profile_path":"/sgw3I1GQ24pDnzNClxbADPuyp92.jpg","credit_id":"55887493c3a368052f000d80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153772,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Herbert B.
