She’s just had her first kiss. She believes this is the bittersweet pain of first love. Her first love is her dad’s girlfriend, Inger. At first, Eva cannot tell if it is her envy of her dad’s love or her passion for Inger, but as time passes she finds herself clearly in love. It is an outstanding film that captures delicate, shaky feelings of first love in a cold Norwegian city in winter.","popularity":0.2463,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Teen girl falls for her father's girlfriend.","title":"Heartcut","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Heartcut","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Bache-Wiig","original_name":"Julia Bache-Wiig","popularity":0.2044,"profile_path":"/pxCEEcpnVWze2RfIW7nQuoJJiMG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Eva","credit_id":"5584d545c3a368502e001cd0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Kristian Berger","original_name":"Tom Kristian Berger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Simen","credit_id":"5584d553c3a368503e001a7f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1010048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Håkon Ramstad","original_name":"Håkon Ramstad","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Father","credit_id":"5584d55cc3a368503e001a83","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Ramvi","original_name":"Maria Ramvi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"5584d56392514173ef001d5b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirsti Eline Torhaug","original_name":"Kirsti Eline Torhaug","popularity":0.1334,"profile_path":"/fQWuGDVwwPWc4hToMl7rokTjuri.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Inger","credit_id":"5584d56cc3a3685037001cde","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Sewitsky","original_name":"Anne Sewitsky","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":"/gC0980ExTiCOjV0u5wwBsQGAFOF.jpg","credit_id":"5584d51ac3a3685037001cd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4851983,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Line Hofoss","original_name":"Line Hofoss","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/ane4nli0b6vT7dqqIOTCuBtjfLt.jpg","credit_id":"679286f3a5280ec544294764","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1422045","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1692,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bapjnhWZyDl98LZ4wg9CKtCALIt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3008},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1692,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pz06833tSlYPe39cRU4NArKRtI6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3008}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
