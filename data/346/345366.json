These are shocking testimonies about the burden of female identity: illegal abortions performed in the '50s without anesthesia; the dynamics of the relationship between husbands and wives; the inability to participate in the enjoyment of sex. A mixture of documentary and narrative filmmaking, Davis' powerful film is a personal female journey to deconstruct the burden of inherited identity. - Stela Jelincic","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/kRpuTvClMEvDT2OrbTSsXv0C4aG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Preponderance of Evidence","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Davis","original_name":"Sandra Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5584d15592514173ec001e94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8019522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t1Qs7UixpaD3jdQcsil2Mvi3Bbi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/krsfCDazJvkjgUSqkrZr8uzKuZC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1578,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kRpuTvClMEvDT2OrbTSsXv0C4aG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1052}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
