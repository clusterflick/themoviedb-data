But one night she does not, and Jon can't sleep. His dad comes up with an idea; he ties a long red thread around his big toe and leaves Jon the other end to hold on to while he sleeps. Now Jon can tug on the thread if he becomes frightened. Late in the night, Jon wakes with a start, following the thread, he finds that it doesn't lead to his father's bedroom, but down the hall, out the front door, and into what he fears the most; the darkness in the never ending forest behind the house.","popularity":0.2636,"poster_path":"/grJeYZ56RF2fzv9dtO2wMihKcFy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian Bokmål","iso_639_1":"nb","name":"Bokmål"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sky Behind the House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Heaven Behind the House","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1310711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Loven Kongsli","original_name":"Lisa Loven Kongsli","popularity":0.5104,"profile_path":"/pm5y6qrZqinsYZW0Rud1DjYU4mP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mom","credit_id":"5587aa82c3a3682746007115","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1480025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erlend Ropstad","original_name":"Erlend Ropstad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dad","credit_id":"5587aa8a9251416818000fcc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1480026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Baatz Strandberg","original_name":"Kurt Baatz Strandberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jon","credit_id":"5587aa939251416b000019db","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steffan Strandberg","original_name":"Steffan Strandberg","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5587aa69c3a36836ea0055a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1880507,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Trond Arntzen","original_name":"Trond Arntzen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66069fd3d4fe04017c27b02f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1926263","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":1090,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/grJeYZ56RF2fzv9dtO2wMihKcFy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":758}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":197349,"name":"children's story"},{"id":330573,"name":"gaute heivoll"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
