When the Kafkaesque routine of a man who is alone to the point of imploding into nothingness begins to fall apart, unexpected love and friendship seep in through the cracks. The film was shot on a handy cam over the course of several days during which a number of scenes of comedy and drama were improvised and gradually built up to a story-arch that was really never put down on paper form.","popularity":0.0746,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2012-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El señor","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Bermejo","original_name":"Luis Bermejo","popularity":0.2386,"profile_path":"/rl4hG3Ou4N244hq5eKhGLz0gIBL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"El Señor","credit_id":"55837f7bc3a36853c4000631","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1478670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paloma Mozo","original_name":"Paloma Mozo","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55837f9fc3a36853d2000651","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1478671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tino Martínez","original_name":"Tino Martínez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55837fbfc3a36853e4000565","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Cavestany","original_name":"Juan Cavestany","popularity":0.1516,"profile_path":"/q89yKseLqsPLCUiqnbMI3Eoxgzb.jpg","credit_id":"55837f5fc3a36853dd000617","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Cavestany","original_name":"Juan Cavestany","popularity":0.1516,"profile_path":"/q89yKseLqsPLCUiqnbMI3Eoxgzb.jpg","credit_id":"6389fd3c69eb90007bdbc513","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2321283","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
