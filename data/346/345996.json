In ancient Egyptian culture, the Book of the Dead consisted of religious texts intended to help preserve the spirit of the departed in the afterlife — but in Elder’s reading, that comforting idea of continuity takes on a rather darker cast. Lamentations is comprised of a complex audio and visual patchwork: a philosophical meditation superimposed as text throughout the film; vignettes featuring a comical but disturbing Franz Liszt, a debate between Isaac Newton and George Berkeley, an angry, deranged man in an alley, and an arrogant psychiatrist; and a final search for salvation in the forests of British Columbia, the American Southwest, and Mexico’s Yucatan.","popularity":0.0898,"poster_path":"/eGXo7seQZsRhMfhbNQ1IRRZMtQt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108849,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lightworks","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1985-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":437,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lamentations: A Monument for the Dead World","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2318433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Fothergill","original_name":"Robert Fothergill","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5d02fccc9251411a82c65120","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristina Jones","original_name":"Kristina Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5d02fcd80e0a26615bcbd64a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David King","original_name":"David King","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Isaac Newton","credit_id":"5d02fd6692514162bcbf6e91","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1576513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James D.
