The bone represents the promise of youth and hope—a promise jealously coveted by the young, but needed more by those grown old. Inverting cultural values, Condit represents feminine youth as a mannequin, and seeks humanity in the form of the older woman, who is reborn by overcoming her fear of death.","popularity":0.0852,"poster_path":"/aimxNu0LWaXMFEtzsqlMUHBRSKQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
