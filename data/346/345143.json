They take off in his car to Washington and begin an affair. Beth, a lonely romance-novel addict, is hopelessly enamored; Ricky is just in it for the (constant) sex. Beth's longing to visit California and Ricky's longing for quick cash leads them into a desperate situation. Director Jost uses a variety of avant-garde visual and narrative techniques, such as montage, collages, split screens and lengthy, tongue-in-cheek monologues to tell the tragicomic story of two complete losers in love.","popularity":0.3368,"poster_path":"/xxEbhuPsB5bydYYynDFegJJvVqU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55795,"logo_path":"/5GDnpABmYFAAptHwYx8jMY4rkeq.png","name":"Complex","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"12 Movements To The Only Conclusion","title":"Frameup","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":389982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Swain","original_name":"Howard Swain","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Ricky Lee Gruber","credit_id":"5582e27bc3a368236c0000ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1011977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Carlin","original_name":"Nancy Carlin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/A7EknJXqqLTb2lMkVjlBdWZ49Is.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Beth-Ann Bolet","credit_id":"5582e289c3a3682d8600009d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Sannella","original_name":"Kate Sannella","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Clerk","credit_id":"5582e297c3a3686cc5000751","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Sannella","original_name":"Kate Sannella","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Motel desk clerk","credit_id":"5582e2a9c3a3686fb90017c2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Jost","original_name":"Jon Jost","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/kYXBWSdUTTGcmJWwMefeZ3nPYmb.jpg","credit_id":"5582e2bfc3a3686c0e00060f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":381120,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Henry S.
