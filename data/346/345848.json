Landscape and architecture that appear to be solid and permanent is experienced unstable and disorienting. In travelling fields I am particularly interested in the idea of geography and how it can be examined and visually reworked in the dimension of altered time and filmic space. In this work I continue to work with shifts in perspective and working with the specific qualities it produces in the image. These qualities are results of certain ways of framing and the parallax movements produced by the travelling camera. It includes architectural elements and different ground surfaces in the Murmansk region, Kola Peninsula, Russia. ","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":71134,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fjordholm Filmproduksjon","origin_country":""},{"id":46201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Norsk Filmfond","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travelling Fields","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2516673,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Helga Fjordholm","original_name":"Helga Fjordholm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ca16551130bd0029cdf4ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1480462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inger Lise Hansen","original_name":"Inger Lise Hansen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ca16942fccee0028a1bb92","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1480462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inger Lise Hansen","original_name":"Inger Lise Hansen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55886b1d9251416fa1000cb7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1695824","wikidata_id":"Q2450567","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2010-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"http://www.norskanimasjon.no/ffaf/movie.sp?id=873","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
