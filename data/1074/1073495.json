Very few people know the true story about, the Digital Compact Cassette or DCC. Was DCC's audio compression the grandfather of all compressed audio formats today? Why did it have such a short life? Why didn't it become popular in more countries? The early termination of the format in 1996, leading to the rejuvenation in 2014 by Techmoan and later the DCCmuseum in countries that rejected the format before. Nearly 2 years of research allowed us to finally get the truth about DCC on camera, presenting DCC enthusiasts the past, present, and potential future of the format we love. This documentary is about the format, the creators, the decision makers, the musicians, the collectors, the geeks, and the audiophiles behind DCC.","popularity":0.343,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Digital Compact Cassette Documentary.","title":"DCC.....There Is Still Music Left To Write","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3828763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mat Taylor","original_name":"Mat Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xmU8nzU0bhLcgkcbFSgkGp1hI23.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"648614bbe2726000afc31789","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2583722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralf Porankiewicz","original_name":"Ralf Porankiewicz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6546fcc65c071b0126ba7d91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12309516","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1576,"name":"technology"},{"id":307152,"name":"music technology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"NAT LAB Eindhoven","release_date":"2019-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Digital Compact Cassette Documentary Trailer with Techmoan","key":"P_pfnrGqxwI","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-11-07T16:06:38.000Z","id":"6486172ae2726000e8c15c2a"}]}}}
