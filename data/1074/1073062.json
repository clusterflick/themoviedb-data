With his parents’ leaving for work before he can even open his eyes, Kenneth is free to use the entire day to discover himself as who he really is deep inside: a girl, all before they come home at 6 P.M. Yaya Inday does her best to help Kenneth break out of his shell by doing his makeup, calling him pretty, and buying him gifts. However, she can’t protect him from everything harmful. One day, when his parents were supposed to arrive home later than usual, Kenneth and Yaya Inday go all out and stage a fashion show, but not everything goes to plan and Kenneth soon faces his painful reality.","popularity":0.0839,"poster_path":"/1iSmFbQqWnntuQiczVbIw2BIAer.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"6
