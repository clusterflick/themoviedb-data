Film sequences of one and the same woman are projected next to each other on different screens. 9 characters with, apparently, their own stories without beginning or end. A woman dissociates into 9 personalities but only one at the time can manifest itself in front of the camera. It is as if one of the characters temporarily borrows the space in the woman, in order to become image. Without any formal directions imposed upon her, the woman sculptures herself nine times from within herself. Unbearably fragile and incompatible with the will of our ego. So the origin of the work can be situated in a grey area of reality where thinking, feeling and observing have fallen apart irreversibly and now try to come closer to each other again.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/zHEAyZqLpot0LNYJ184kbYMWgBh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Installation for 9 Personalities in 1 Body","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3871990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riet Storms","original_name":"Riet Storms","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63c22e8617b5ef008a420b57","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3871770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","original_name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/usYoBflfIICRHs6KdaJzjYOkF7z.jpg","credit_id":"63c22e9317b5ef00a7fbbd30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3871770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","original_name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/usYoBflfIICRHs6KdaJzjYOkF7z.jpg","credit_id":"63c22edaa5743d007d1220fe","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3871770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","original_name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/usYoBflfIICRHs6KdaJzjYOkF7z.jpg","credit_id":"63c23857df857c00bc220a89","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zHEAyZqLpot0LNYJ184kbYMWgBh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
