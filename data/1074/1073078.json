In August 2014, a three-year-old girl disappeared, but she was not immediately missed: people assumed she had left with her dad, who lived in a neighboring village. Only on the third day was it revealed that her dad had not picked her up. The village searched for her for 12 days and found her alive, thanks to a faithful friend — a puppy. In honor of Karina and her dog Naida, a monument was erected at the Yakutsk airport, and a book published called \"Karina. 12 Days in the Taiga.\" This story dramatically changed the life of a little girl from a tiny village and her family. Today she is already 12 years old and studying at a ballet school.","popularity":0.7782,"poster_path":"/xBktqngkV6lY7ipdAaanBTw8q5X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102017,"logo_path":"/1KqWCxRXWDEdHwFntNdP1Yptej.png","name":"Art
