Donning theatrical face-paint and a wig, Labat transforms himself into an icon of Babalu, the Afro-Cuban folk god. His use of Babalu as a cultural metaphor is steeped in irony; to millions of Americans, Babalu is the theme song of Cuban bandleader Ricky Ricardo on TV's I Love Lucy. In other sequences, Labat deconstructs the stereotypical gestures and objects — macho posturing, jai alai, maracas — that are used by the media to signify \"Latin culture.\"","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Babalu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2513252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Labat","original_name":"Tony Labat","popularity":0.0472,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c1870e23be4600d960b8fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
