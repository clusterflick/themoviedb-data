A woman walking through 3 video images. Three screens display how the day’s light passes by: from the early morning light until late at night. Along with the woman the artist walks through the forest, in the same rhythm, the same pace. Off-screen she looks through the camera, fragmenting time. The age-old androgynous trees are a vertical constant along which the woman moves, as if in an interval between visibility and invisibility, between sound and silence, while the light keeps on evolving metabletically.","popularity":0.0794,"poster_path":"/e0ME4VgM1a4Q8syq6N5MDdmzLzS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forest","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3871990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riet Storms","original_name":"Riet Storms","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63c239b68efe7300a0eb29b9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3871770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","original_name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/usYoBflfIICRHs6KdaJzjYOkF7z.jpg","credit_id":"63c239cde16e5a0092b47a20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3871770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","original_name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/usYoBflfIICRHs6KdaJzjYOkF7z.jpg","credit_id":"63c239d505a53300aed0063c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3871770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","original_name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/usYoBflfIICRHs6KdaJzjYOkF7z.jpg","credit_id":"63c239dddf857c007cbeb065","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":896,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e0ME4VgM1a4Q8syq6N5MDdmzLzS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":598}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
