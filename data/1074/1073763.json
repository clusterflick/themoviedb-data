Installation on view at Locus Loppem, Kunsthalle Lophem, 2005. Lucy was found in Ethiopia. She's considered to be the eldest human being ever discovered. She was born about 3.5 million years ago. She was small and lightly built, probably not much more than 1m tall. In a pink bed lies a naked young girl with a pink felt doll. The girl is about ten, eleven years old. The doll has the same size and physiognomy as the girl. It may be her alter ego, or it may be the girl that soon will be a woman, or maybe it’s just the last doll a mother sewed for her daughter. These two fragile images show the search for identity in a kind of reflection. The contact between the girl and the doll slowly disappears, the child soon becomes a woman.","popularity":0.0964,"poster_path":"/8LxowpwUdzEKI7PQftlO5ZF0jvf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3871938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anaïs Bollansée","original_name":"Anaïs Bollansée","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63c22933a5743d00c3bfb3f2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3871770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","original_name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/usYoBflfIICRHs6KdaJzjYOkF7z.jpg","credit_id":"63c22951df857c009f445a80","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3871770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","original_name":"Marie Julia Bollansée","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/usYoBflfIICRHs6KdaJzjYOkF7z.jpg","credit_id":"63c229488efe73007d8fa0c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LxowpwUdzEKI7PQftlO5ZF0jvf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
