The stations’ sizes are impressive: Gare du Nord is bigger than the Louvre or Notre-Dame de Paris. These railway stations are architectural landmarks and a model of urban planning despite the radical changes they’ve undergone since their construction in the middle of the 19th century. How did the railway stations manage to absorb the boom of travelers in just a few decades? What colossal works were necessary to erect and then modify these now essential buildings? From the monumental glass walls of Gare du Nord to the iconic tower of Gare de Lyon, to the first-ever all-electric train station, each has its own story, technical characteristics, and well-defined urban image.","popularity":0.2917,"poster_path":"/wHbAeAGrzmyOVQuEcelXPjbm10V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139669,"logo_path":"/9Fhvr0xOJxbrJ3JoiltfQwIJj1H.png","name":"RMC
