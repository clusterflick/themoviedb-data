Overcome by a strange and irrepressible lassitude, the group collapses into a deep sleep. Awoken by a smell as delicious as it is heady, feverish and famished, they set out to find food.

Intoxicating and exhilirating, this substance quickly provokes troubling side effects.","popularity":0.0775,"poster_path":"/4dnGR80vK3oXYNxM1ySQbqoM7V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stone Starved","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Bates","original_name":"Colin Bates","popularity":0.241,"profile_path":"/2DPLA5o6ugweovd0fvdwhr8erZy.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63c10779a5743d00961e6fd1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3870307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra d'Herouville","original_name":"Alexandra d'Herouville","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"63c107898efe7300c83f8026","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3870308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Didier","original_name":"Jeanne Didier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"63c10791e16e5a008191e9ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3870309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Buléon Kayser","original_name":"Louise Buléon Kayser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"63c107988efe73007d8f2708","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3870310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pénélope Levy","original_name":"Pénélope Levy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"63c1079ee16e5a00afcb4495","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lélé Matelo","original_name":"Lélé Matelo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/rtsiJNUIAnvv4GvvKzSjC27S6mU.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"63c107a523be4600892d1f76","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1616409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Mélinand","original_name":"Laura Mélinand","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"63c107abe16e5a008ac7de84","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1616408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Azoulay","original_name":"Georgia Azoulay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c10726e16e5a00d403545c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1616408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Azoulay","original_name":"Georgia Azoulay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c1072ce16e5a008191e9ac","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1616407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Félixe de Becker","original_name":"Félixe de Becker","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/yAXUt8TNF1bYpARWEU05fRe7xu4.jpg","credit_id":"63c1073923be46007cba7004","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1616407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Félixe de Becker","original_name":"Félixe de Becker","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/yAXUt8TNF1bYpARWEU05fRe7xu4.jpg","credit_id":"63c1073de16e5a008ac7de50","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3870305,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ambroise le Guay","original_name":"Ambroise le Guay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c10748e16e5a008191e9c1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2209346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonin Le Guay","original_name":"Antonin Le Guay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c10751a5743d0089102fc0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3870306,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Damien Carissimo","original_name":"Damien Carissimo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c1075adf857c0081419345","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2193013,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Muriel Douvry","original_name":"Muriel Douvry","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c1076805a53300e99b9008","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9447480","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4dnGR80vK3oXYNxM1ySQbqoM7V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
