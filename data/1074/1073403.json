Oscar Niemeyer remains one of the most important architects in modern history. The Brazilian visionary, who died in 2012 aged 104, elevated modern architecture beyond the realms of function and created buildings that are works of art and express the highest attributes of humanity. His work with reinforced concrete in particular created new architectural forms and possibilities, eschewing the tyranny of angles to create waves and swooping arches of such soaring beauty that they represent nothing less than physical poetry.","popularity":0.2022,"poster_path":"/mNQseZh2dQdlFAjlIVVX8ynWVjU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fine TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Skating the creations of Oscar Niemeyer","title":"Concrete Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3870502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Barros","original_name":"Pedro Barros","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63c143718efe7300f0a2f7a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Niemeyer","original_name":"Oscar Niemeyer","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/i496kELSgSsKY5teJbTuKS6EO9G.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63c1438505a53300aecf9f85","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3870504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murilo Peres","original_name":"Murilo Peres","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63c14394e16e5a00d4036c0a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Haddad","original_name":"Hugo Haddad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c143a98efe73007d8f4001","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2681726,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victoria Mazzia","original_name":"Victoria Mazzia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c143cb23be4600817c899f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3870506,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nina Sanabio","original_name":"Nina Sanabio","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c143b823be4600d960a016","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12717248","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4A0DFN01YHcscunXHLeKjUAx2L3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mNQseZh2dQdlFAjlIVVX8ynWVjU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":272474,"name":"architectures"},{"id":277286,"name":"curta"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":303427,"name":"skate"},{"id":313762,"name":"radical sport"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
