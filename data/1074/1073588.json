Respectively, on maternity leave and off work, one is on edge, the other no longer feels anything. The neighbors are both filled with a feeling of failure: despite their careers and families, they are not happy. Florence's first infidelity will be a revelation. What if happiness was rebelling against our rigid society of performance? In a context where having fun is very low on the list of priorities, sleeping with a delivery guy is perhaps downright revolutionary. For Violette and Florence, it will be the breath of fresh air they were hoping for.","popularity":0.7567,"poster_path":"/4TCAsaSIUTLNRfzGIYsmiyBW3E9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66512,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amérique
