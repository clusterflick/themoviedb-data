Vahan, being born and raised in Yerevan, but growing increasingly disappointed in Armenian reality (the earthquake, the war, the collapse of the Soviet Union), moves to Tallinn, then Kyiv and Odesa to works there. After his passing Vahan's remains were buried in Tallinn, Odesa, and Yerevan. His artistic heritage remains in faraway countries.","popularity":0.1122,"poster_path":"/xnbzZNkimYGJFskNenVtgPiPHv7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"}],"release_date":"2022-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Graves of the Artist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Три могили митця","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruben Khachatryan","original_name":"Ruben Khachatryan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e13d75b77d4b113e0782ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harutyun Khachatryan","original_name":"Harutyun Khachatryan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/1uepRp2K3shEvObE1MlKaelwOAn.jpg","credit_id":"64e13d8a5ab81a00ad214256","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1996717,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mikayel Stamboltsyan","original_name":"Mikayel Stamboltsyan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e13d9baaec7103fbeb677e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruben Khachatryan","original_name":"Ruben Khachatryan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e13dafe19de90100e8fb53","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3096348,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Vrezh Petrosyan","original_name":"Vrezh Petrosyan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e13dc32495ab00e37c366a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1568366,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vahagn Ter-Hakobyan","original_name":"Vahagn Ter-Hakobyan","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e13dd34a52f800e4393b83","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harutyun Khachatryan","original_name":"Harutyun Khachatryan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/1uepRp2K3shEvObE1MlKaelwOAn.jpg","credit_id":"63c1fa3905a5330094ef9eaa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28696575","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1410,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xnbzZNkimYGJFskNenVtgPiPHv7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Golden Apricot International Film Festival","release_date":"2022-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Varna, public screening","release_date":"2023-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Odesa","release_date":"2023-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Odesa International Film Festival ","release_date":"2023-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
