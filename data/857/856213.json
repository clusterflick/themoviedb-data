Column instructor Zhou Qiang (played by Pan Wenzhan), machine gunner Lao Shen (played by Jin Yan) and health worker Yang Yuwen (played by Zhang Zheng) were outnumbered and unfortunately captured in order to cover the retreat of the sick and wounded. During the escort, Zhou Qiang and others, with the help of everyone, killed the enemy squad leader (played by Dong Lin) and led the others to successfully escape. They re-armed themselves with captured weapons, fought guerrillas with the enemy in Siming Mountain, and mobilized the surrounding people to consolidate their own strength.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/aLDHpntD5m1S1zfZ6W4yOGPCfBG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1950-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"大地重光","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3181144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shikai Tian","original_name":"Shikai Tian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"敌兵甲","credit_id":"6104d33f8ee49c005e11b1ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3181146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Qi Wang","original_name":"Qi Wang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"孙二虎","credit_id":"6104d358fdc1460046f508e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2261902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Nong","original_name":"Li Nong","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/8K19DX4dZk7aNzjSdhuuvHmDrkR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"老李","credit_id":"6104d363d100b60046141932","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2050033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xu Tao","original_name":"Xu Tao","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/2fQPVFFNkmG7H1P1knXLkNyILQz.jpg","credit_id":"6104d3334284ea00463f1dd5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aLDHpntD5m1S1zfZ6W4yOGPCfBG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1950-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
