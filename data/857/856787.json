Sunlight shines through leafy trees. The camera zooms in until the image is out of focus. When it zooms out again, it reveals sunlight through leaves reflected in the window of a house. From inside the house, we see a woman, in colour and fully dressed, walk by a window. Outside, the camera and photographer are seen in a mirror. The woman, in black & white now and inside the house nude, walks around a large room, trapped. Further images of the naked woman are interspersed with colour images of the garden outside: pond, lilies, etc. Eventually, the image of the cameraman and his mirror returns and the reflection in the window and the sunshine through trees are repeated.","popularity":0.2018,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Royal College of Art","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chromatic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Woolley","original_name":"Richard Woolley","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106d470f96a3900302dd155","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Woolley","original_name":"Richard Woolley","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106d47c6a300b00752787b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Woolley","original_name":"Richard Woolley","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106d48bf96a3900302dd19a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Garcia","original_name":"Jerry Garcia","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/6jAKLIekOs6FFcc783PZ1pb8soe.jpg","credit_id":"6106d49ef96a39005d9831a4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3182998,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Howard Whales","original_name":"Howard Whales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106d4b37a1bd60028e0e78b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
