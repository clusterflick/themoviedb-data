The programme will include the fabulous site of the Edgley Optica which flew on only one day of the show, complete with in-cockpit cameras. We'll also go on board during the dramatic display of the A380. The programme also includes interviews with pilots of the BAE Systems Typhoon, Airbus A350, SAAB Gripen and 737 Max as well as designer of the Optica John Edgley.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vTo4vPGbXQK94oaZ4P7lqWUCQfS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farnborough International Airshow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5JV8VTuVgRlUOqYo6g9yKTSr5aP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vTo4vPGbXQK94oaZ4P7lqWUCQfS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
