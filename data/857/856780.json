We are taken through the story of The Cumparsita, from its creation, its debut at La Giralda, the first recordings, the legal debates and world repercussions of this tango that transcends its creator and its time. Thanks to documents and the memories of members of his family, Gerardo Matos Rodríguez, the author, ceases to be just a signature at the bottom of a sheet of music and comes alive as a bohemian, elegant, talented man full of mysteries and with a dark side as well.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":"/zjMEzZbmHkO261YFtPcPU14qfmh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2004-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story of Gerardo Matos Rodríguez","title":"The Cumparsita; the Uruguayan Tango","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","title":"La Cumparsita: el Tango uruguayo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3182939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darío Medina","original_name":"Darío Medina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106cd7d17c44300468f194c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3182939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darío Medina","original_name":"Darío Medina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106cd84f96a3900302dc216","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3182940,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mariana Gerosa","original_name":"Mariana Gerosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106cd95aad9c2002d6fefca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3182940,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mariana Gerosa","original_name":"Mariana Gerosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106cd9d7719d7002c9c752e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3182941,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martín Presente","original_name":"Martín Presente","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106cda917c443005d52377f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3182942,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pablo Bergamín","original_name":"Pablo Bergamín","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106cdbb7a1bd60081da17f4","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3182942,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pablo Bergamín","original_name":"Pablo Bergamín","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106cdc37ad08c005e5579b1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3182943,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ezekiel Fernández","original_name":"Ezekiel Fernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106cdd12a210c002b415aee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3182947,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gustavo Gravina","original_name":"Gustavo Gravina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106ce507719d7005d9a2a63","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3182948,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gerardo Matos Rodríguez","original_name":"Gerardo Matos Rodríguez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6106ce5caad9c200465494df","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rEdqhNM5ogmkSuM45mBgW5F4Dtm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zjMEzZbmHkO261YFtPcPU14qfmh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
