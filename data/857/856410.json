There is a syncretism on the island, between the beliefs of a primitive animism, traditional Christianity and the more recent faith of the Nigerian Evangelical church. Princesa's face reflects an inner world dominated by fear, the break with her own land, and the desire to make good in a new one. Footage shot during a Nigerian funeral rite and a sequence from a Nollywood drama both contain biographical traces of the lead character. Princesa has made a choice, but she is not yet free.","popularity":0.0749,"poster_path":"/jwc0SLAf147WuXHU36VX5we7dVs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caucaso Società Cooperativa","origin_country":""},{"id":154601,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roda Film Productions","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":91435,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regione Autonoma della Sardegna","origin_country":""},{"id":160756,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmotor","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Princesa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Favour Osazuwa","original_name":"Favour Osazuwa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"613cc95ea6ddcb0042bcf58e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suor Regina Sanna","original_name":"Suor Regina Sanna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"613cc963d4cc8e002ab5b7d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julieth N.
