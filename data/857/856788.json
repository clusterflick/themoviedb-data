It examines the democracies that re-emerged after military rule and we hear the testimony of presidents Carlos Menem, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Patricio Alwyn and Luis Alberto Lacalle, and the reflections of many other key figures of that time. There is also an early discussion of the regional integration process that these countries were planning to promote, so we are shown a representative mosaic of each country, which makes this material truly unique.","popularity":0.093,"poster_path":"/5uVYabWNNbiHut3gdmA4D9PKBhD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108544,"logo_path":null,"name":"CEMA","origin_country":""},{"id":57046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nueva
