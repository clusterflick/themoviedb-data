Gloria,  her wife, struggles to keep the parts of memory that time has not yet extinguished, each time with less fortune and more wear and tear.  Both Gloria and Candela are increasingly lost in that disease that drags them to the two and separates them. Gloria understands that even if she is capable of recovering pieces of the past shared with Candela, it will never be the same; although they can live moments similar to those of their youth.","popularity":0.0784,"poster_path":"/yJpcyFPkvZlNTSTsNQKntfiBO21.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125464,"logo_path":"/15QecLDcLXewxFZMy711wIR8AvZ.png","name":"SchoolTraining","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They are no longer more than two old women in front of a mirror.","title":"Gloria y Candela","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2350034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Pilar Vaquero","original_name":"José Pilar Vaquero","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Gloria","credit_id":"61045b6a2a210c007e14b45a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3180723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria López","original_name":"Gloria López","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Candela","credit_id":"61045bbe4284ea005d1abad6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1967329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beatriz Delgado","original_name":"Beatriz Delgado","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/6bWhetHh92K5YtyXozW8o2MFEun.jpg","credit_id":"61045c004f33ad002d8f212c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3180724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alicia Arwgar","original_name":"Alicia Arwgar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61045beb42d837005c455d54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3180730,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"María Palancar","original_name":"María Palancar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61045c7e23d278005dbd5a38","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19858130","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"gloriaycandelaoficial","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yJpcyFPkvZlNTSTsNQKntfiBO21.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
