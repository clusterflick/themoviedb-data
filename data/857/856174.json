He was a textile worker and also a member of parliament for the Communist Party, and he was expelled from their ranks in the 1950s. He was a journalist, a militant activist and a political prisoner, and a key force in trade union unity and left wing politics in Uruguay. His life was bound up with some of the most important events in the history of this country after 1930. As well as Héctor's own testimony we have the voices of textile workers, intellectuals, union members and politicians, in a rich mixture of archive film and photographs.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/sFPs7lQbOPTO8smTM8voO5hdH6d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158119,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avril","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2001-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Héctor the Weaver","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1458012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Pedro Charlo","original_name":"José Pedro Charlo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9wbpUcgDpejqX07M8Ai0cWnrSzY.jpg","credit_id":"6104aac242d837002de4c859","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1458012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Pedro Charlo","original_name":"José Pedro Charlo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9wbpUcgDpejqX07M8Ai0cWnrSzY.jpg","credit_id":"6104aaca6611b40075366031","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169705,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Universindo Rodríguez Díaz","original_name":"Universindo Rodríguez Díaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104aadca76ac50046430fc2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169705,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Universindo Rodríguez Díaz","original_name":"Universindo Rodríguez Díaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104aae86611b40046edeb29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3161866,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel Cheico","original_name":"Daniel Cheico","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104ab048ee49c005e115362","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3161866,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel Cheico","original_name":"Daniel Cheico","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104ab0b7d5f4b005e8777b5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3154304,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alvaro Mechoso","original_name":"Alvaro Mechoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104ab186517d60046860f36","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167726,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jorge García","original_name":"Jorge García","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104ab656517d6007ea738b5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3159787,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonardo Croatto","original_name":"Leonardo Croatto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104ab7d7d5f4b0046b1db7b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3181023,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rubén Olivera","original_name":"Rubén Olivera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104abaaf706de007e936902","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2121467,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlos Da Silveira","original_name":"Carlos Da Silveira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104abb6a76ac50046431261","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0389022","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nb2OglGqJcMeW81i4NOvNsnPP0h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sFPs7lQbOPTO8smTM8voO5hdH6d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2001-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
