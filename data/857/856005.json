It tells of the heavy cost of war to women. After ten years of struggle for independence, the war in Angola had continued for another twenty years. The film explores the motives of the combatants, including Cuba and South Africa's apartheid government. In this film, Folly lets women tell their own stories. She shows the women from mid- or close-range, forcing the viewer to focus on their faces rather than their bodies or surroundings, and takes the time to let them say what they have to say, giving a unique women's perspective of the conflict. Folly participates in the film through her voice-over, giving a subjective element. She admits that she is not familiar with Angola, and certainly is not an authority. The film thus becomes a record of Folly's own journey of discovery.","popularity":0.0594,"poster_path":"/evkdRJ8jVD0f7UkFvLGNjchD2q3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158262,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amanou Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TG","name":"Togo"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Forgotten Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Neto","original_name":"Ruth Neto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61042167688cd0007f206d9c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1323956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne-Laure Folly","original_name":"Anne-Laure Folly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610421746611b40046ecb755","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1323956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne-Laure Folly","original_name":"Anne-Laure Folly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104217b42d8370045ecda8e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12658472","wikidata_id":"Q5973734","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/evkdRJ8jVD0f7UkFvLGNjchD2q3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
