Meanwhile, a lonely young girl is attracted by the balloons' hissing sounds, and is drawn to the shadow's lair. The grinning shadow quickly ties her up, but, overconfident, becomes entangled in his own machinery, and has the body squeezed out of him. All that's left is one of the balloons, which the girl takes with her as she leaves, now quite happy.","popularity":0.053,"poster_path":"/aj3XXh2KS0SbxF5ZFOQxvzyT8p6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Balloon","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":587305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Lidster","original_name":"Ken Lidster","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c7af08c3a36840870003f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0125668","wikidata_id":"Q20827132","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yPlQ11Wa0DjseL6ZYz4V7LcnnVy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aj3XXh2KS0SbxF5ZFOQxvzyT8p6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8Pnvcuj4kfHZZByahq0k2SeNqMP.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
