The view we see reflected in Gocho’s photographic images has become more profound over time since his death and has struck a chord in people’s hearts. While focusing on Gocho’s collection of photographs Self and Others, the film also visits places associated with him, creating a collage with the manuscripts, letters, photographs and voice recordings remaining in an attempt to capture “one more gesture”—a theme pursued by Gocho through photographic expression.  This film is neither a critical biography nor a monograph on the photographer. Rather, we are offered a new perception. As if mesmerized, the photographs Gocho left behind captivate us in their gaze.","popularity":0.2844,"poster_path":"/8osCb1HeJEe6kTumljm7jmLSKfz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2001-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self and Others","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hidetoshi Nishijima","original_name":"西島秀俊","popularity":1.2244,"profile_path":"/3FBdbeMMWfyKmHS5j8IECwsZWcY.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"(Narrator)","credit_id":"6759a4cd26b9b8adaffef88d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Makoto Satō","original_name":"佐藤真","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":"/9KywC3AWxWT4mQF8EqsFj0a4Ojx.jpg","credit_id":"5701cecdc3a368568c00178e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600695,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Miyagi Shigeo","original_name":"Miyagi Shigeo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5701cf18925141607f0014f0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600697,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nobuyuki Kikuchi","original_name":"菊池信之","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5701cf419251416ec900125b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600696,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kyomaro","original_name":"Kyomaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5701cf23c3a36856ab001616","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600694,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Thorikoshi Kenzo","original_name":"Thorikoshi Kenzo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5701cf07c3a368569c00191c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70631,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Masaki Tamura","original_name":"たむらまさき","popularity":0.1622,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b757f40c3a36875500119c3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63997,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kenzo Horikoshi","original_name":"堀越謙三","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/i3d6MadFQg0HddyspyBwnIVXddz.jpg","credit_id":"5fb015ceec4552003ff682b4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1523543","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aRyqBeVODNLtaMxi1OviTnN95Y6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1431,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/8osCb1HeJEe6kTumljm7jmLSKfz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":954}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1003,"name":"photographer"},{"id":6025,"name":"photography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
