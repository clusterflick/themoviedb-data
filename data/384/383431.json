Who better that you to say when enough is enough. That's the tough question to answer, but it is put forth in this film as it focuses on Mademoiselle Lisette Nigot.  Of course, the easier question is why can't those with a terminal disease and in constant pain be allowed to go? That example is also given and it is harder for a rational human being to deny this individual relief from pain.  The right to die is surely as important as the right to live, or maybe it isn't. You owe it to yourself and society to be informed on the question, and this film does an excellent job of doing just that.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mademoiselle and the Doctor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0976143","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
