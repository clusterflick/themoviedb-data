Beside her, the famous bass-baritone Michele Pertusi, as Athanaël, shows once again his unquestionable style. On the podium is Marcello Viotti, music director of the Venetian theatre. The story of the conversion of the beautiful courtesan, and the clash between spirituality and sensuality have been portrayed brilliantly by Pier Luigi Pizzi, one of today’s most talented opera directors. The visual quality of this production is indeed one of its strong points, and the DVD recording will not fail to fascinate the viewer.","popularity":0.0459,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thais","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Mei","original_name":"Eva Mei","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0f40c1ed28b9003ab36e0a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Pertusi","original_name":"Michele Pertusi","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/fJx3QXGTMQ6Z0sCAQIvFIsyNLlE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0f40cba313b8003432b388","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Joyner","original_name":"William Joyner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0f40d70231f20038fdb5a1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Fei","original_name":"Christophe Fei","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0f40f8c433ea00375ac5be","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1265281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Buffle","original_name":"Christine Buffle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0f4105a313b8003532afab","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elodie Méchain","original_name":"Elodie Méchain","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0f41176818880034aafdd8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713282,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Louis Gailet","original_name":"Louis Gailet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0f413f1da7a6003615551f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiziano Mancini","original_name":"Tiziano Mancini","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/kfowQbHkoA32VPcuqxVNacnVncc.jpg","credit_id":"5f0f413060620a00348330f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0418235","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
