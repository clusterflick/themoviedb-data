This movie most closely tracks the conversations of two soon to be soldiers and the hand held tape recorder that one hides from the drill instructors. When one of them gets a leave to go to Tehran this recorder becomes a means of communicating to home for many of the conscripts, and is a way for them to pick up the sounds of the city in the remote training camp.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/2XM6lo5hhxGztVf2Zo5gyMCBZ9Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letters in the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alireza Amini","original_name":"Alireza Amini","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c998d79251414a7a003b63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0333978","wikidata_id":"Q14755898","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1483,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2XM6lo5hhxGztVf2Zo5gyMCBZ9Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
