But as long as I make 'em laugh, they ain't going to put me away.\" You'll see how nuts he can be-and how much he can make you laugh-in this hilarious collection of sketches, clips, monologues, and routines featuring goofs, flubs, missed cues, blown lines, and zany antics. Whether he's wincing over a joke that died, cracking up his co-stars, or muttering about what he did during rehearsal, these moments that weren't in the script showcase Skelton at his wild and unpredictable best. You'll see him clowning with guest stars Harpo Marx, Vincent Price, and Audrey Meadows, and as Deadeye, Clem Kadiddlehopper, San Fernando Red, Freddy the Freeloader, George Appleby, and other classic roles.","popularity":0.0949,"poster_path":"/oK4PLyJm2LBHpl9Vygy78HX8pyj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Red at His Unscripted, Unpredictable Best.","title":"Red Skelton: Bloopers, Blunders, and Ad Libs","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Red Skelton","original_name":"Red Skelton","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":"/mW8nmbbswhAkEQd2YJ0VA7JGooO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself (Host)/Various Characters","credit_id":"639ce43d2d531a008490ac34","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":970531,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stan Cayre","original_name":"Stan Cayre","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639ce4b9326ec100b79fde60","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3833777,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marge Ruffolo","original_name":"Marge Ruffolo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639ce5641e259a00bf90855e","department":"Editing","job":"Archival Footage Research"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365844,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sandy Oliveri","original_name":"Sandy Oliveri","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639ce45a2d531a00b0dd7f26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":970532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ken Cayre","original_name":"Ken Cayre","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639ce5002d531a00b0dd7f48","department":"Crew","job":"Creative Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3833775,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Harris","original_name":"Paul Harris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639ce4ea326ec100ef3d29f4","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":970533,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe Cayre","original_name":"Joe Cayre","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639ce48dbe4b3600e9c717b5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132543,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eileen Ruffolo","original_name":"Eileen Ruffolo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639ce530b7d35205ac75f35d","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":970532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ken Cayre","original_name":"Ken Cayre","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639ce4a07314a100893d20c1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oK4PLyJm2LBHpl9Vygy78HX8pyj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
