In his earlier film, a landmark of cinematic deconstruction, Jacobs re-photographed and manipulated a film fragment from the dawn of cinema, penetrating the image to reach the sublime. In Anaglyph Tom, the artist applies the anaglyph 3-D process to the original footage, engaging the experience of depth perception as the subject of his relentless experimentation and dizzying interventions.","popularity":0.0799,"poster_path":"/hyNL6fAAUonwyBryrLdWCorGq43.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anaglyph Tom (Tom with Puffy Cheeks)","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Jacobs","original_name":"Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/lLWmlUKswUHhW6TEHD4i56xleke.jpg","credit_id":"56c3f166c3a36871fa0010fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1336,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pgZhd0eYC7pB7NVjQV0iJpoVnlk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":890},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hyNL6fAAUonwyBryrLdWCorGq43.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
