Gizem and Bengi were in love but the city didn't welcome much girls like them. Fuat had spent his life as a homeless in the streets of Istanbul. There has been a belief that an old spiritual ship once got stuck in Istanbul. A ship that would only be visible to the ones who would belong to it, who would need it in their lives. A ship that would take them to where they belong to. The ship was about to take off.  The film is inspired by the short animation film called \"How Did The Amentu Ship Move\", made in 1970 by Tonguç Yaşar and Sezer Tansuğ.","popularity":0.1719,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2015-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Belonging","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","title":"AiDiYET","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bengi
