The story is set in an abandoned zoo. The zoo itself is inspired by the Antwerp Zoo in the nineteenth century and is covered in a mysterious environment reminding of Rene Magritte paintings: The Empire of Light. Under a radiating sunny sky, the landscape is covered in darkness. The opportunistic director of the abandoned zoo instructs a doctor to do some medical experiments on a gorilla, one of the few animals left in the zoo. If the experiment turns out well, the zoo could again become the great attraction it once was.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuru","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Palmaers","original_name":"Michael Palmaers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c7225c9251415b5a000108","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2158673","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
