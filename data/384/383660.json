Almost every bone in his body was broken and neurological damage meant that he would never play his guitar in front of an audience again. Apart from a couple of tribute concerts, Nic Jones disappeared from the public eye for thirty years. Then in the summer of 2012, encouraged by friends and family, Nic returned to the stage to play several festival performances.. The concerts were a resounding success and for his old and new fans, a moving comeback for their musical hero.","popularity":0.0925,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
