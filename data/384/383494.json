A sprinkle of hope enters when a escaped zebra runs free in the city. The eight strangers all are subconsciously enticed to catch this zebra. In doing so, their lives intertwine and are profoundly changed. This is a story about liberty, compassion and hope in modern times of troublesome existential thought.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gestreept","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toon Mertens","original_name":"Toon Mertens","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c6169e9251412696003341","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1402140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Baeckeland","original_name":"Jonas Baeckeland","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c61692925141269600333e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1415197","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
