Wagner's score is simply more illustrative and sensuously pictorial than any series of stage pictures could be. This production with the Deutsche Oper Berlin stars Rene Kollo and Gweneth Jones in the title roles. This program represents a historical milestone and document of the highest value in the reception of Richard Wagner's 'Tristan und Isolde.'
