Included are a rare clip of Red's famous vaudeville routine, Guzzler's Gin; a prevue for his film Public Pigeon No. 1; and footage from his Emmy Award-winning show, with guests Jack Benny and Ed Sullivan. Ed enacts such memorable characters as Cauliflower McPugg, Clem Kadiddlehopper (teaching Pedestrian Polo), Willie Lump Lump (showing how to make a salad), Deadeye, and BBC newscaster Lord Beaverhead. You'll also see rare clips from rehearsal show with Martha Raye, with uncensored ad-libs and goofs never aired on TV, and the classic blooper that occurred when an onstage cow contributed its own unique \"ad-lib.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/KL1MzEXcY8supet61uhxxRKSPS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Celebrate Red's Reign from Vaudeville to Movies and TV.","title":"Red Skelton - King of Laughter","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/KL1MzEXcY8supet61uhxxRKSPS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
