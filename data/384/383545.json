There he lives on the outskirts of the city with his sister and her sick child in a barren single room, and supports them through working various jobs. The environment is far from welcoming, but Anderson is driven by a burgeoning awareness of his two-spirited sexuality, which he feels can only be realized in the anonymity of the city. Anderson finds himself in limbo, questioning and rejecting certain tribal rituals, even as he fiercely defends his community and seeks to find peace with his identity.","popularity":0.1212,"poster_path":"/gfulxDaSrh2sDUTiDB0cziGZGLq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Was Endless","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1702923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anderson Tikuna","original_name":"Anderson Tikuna","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Anderson","credit_id":"5819c46292514133a2005a52","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1710024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Severiano Kedassere","original_name":"Severiano Kedassere","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Velho Pajé","credit_id":"582d993bc3a368773300693a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1680244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fidelis Baniwa","original_name":"Fidelis Baniwa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zIdxxPRG1e8EJwGC4W1Lfh0dIy5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tunarê","credit_id":"582d995ec3a36879c1001299","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1710026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kay Sara","original_name":"Kay Sara","popularity":0.1137,"profile_path":"/sn27c4DGW4b2mFetI4LXUfGkUBa.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Irmã","credit_id":"582d997dc3a368773600642c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Begê Muniz","original_name":"Begê Muniz","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/mMHFB4oPdevEBWwWRUdeIgmXj6G.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Beto","credit_id":"5819c438c3a368094f00585f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Carelli","original_name":"Rita Carelli","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/nbFkrpoOAkpat2zSBNJwGErmWAi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pia","credit_id":"5819c42d92514133ab00569c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1462970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fábio Baldo","original_name":"Fábio Baldo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/vCpfd55c3RfMGMzj1z3MIckNRha.jpg","credit_id":"5831e99d92514162cb02a158","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1579746,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sergio Andrade","original_name":"Sergio Andrade","popularity":0.139,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa5b2a59251412790028f39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5457252","wikidata_id":"Q22813590","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9RBYLyVS2dSn0arRVbRqi02oC51.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/gfulxDaSrh2sDUTiDB0cziGZGLq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/tRGKV7gaQ7JJu9GsoZVnLFNlEoP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1368},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/OvamnrycxqmFuTqmD6Xg1MBkdh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival de Berlim","release_date":"2016-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Antes o Tempo Não Acabava / Time Was Endless (Trailer)","key":"y2A05vSXrUY","published_at":"2016-09-07T15:22:35.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"598b6bbcc3a3687865032b5d"}]}}}
