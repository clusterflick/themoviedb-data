Yet this particular set-up is unusual. The lovers here are Ingeborg Bachmann and Paul Celan, both important representatives of post-war German-language poetry. The story of the relationship between the Austrian and the Jew from Czernowitz is told through their nearly 20-year correspondence (1948–1967). Or, more precisely, by a young woman and a young man reading from their letters in a studio in Vienna’s venerable Funkhaus.","popularity":0.219,"poster_path":"/tL3W3XUzrEMOK3aYPm5c4beeS1M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83352,"logo_path":"/lq0MNYW0xmgI15OJVbQbjujTEGO.png","name":"Ruth Beckermann
