The writing of the script for film no. 29 and the parallel efforts to secure financing form the thread that runs through this cinematic portrait, which consists wholly of conversations and observations around Thome’s home, a converted farm in Brandenburg. The filmmaker is nothing if not forthcoming, and the viewer has the opportunity to experience him in various other roles: as a gardener, a father, a cyclist, and a performer of his own persona.","popularity":0.1303,"poster_path":"/7HekNhKYnbPMpbNoAWFpUU3PzvT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73323,"logo_path":"/ovSY3fYAb8Fz6AfNl2Q2lqod6Hb.png","name":"Luzid Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rudolf Thome - Flowers Everywhere","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudolf Thome","original_name":"Rudolf Thome","popularity":0.5453,"profile_path":"/kW3HVlssUTrUGS4kKBIzG9YmVS3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56c4ac9bc3a3680d520001b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joya Thome","original_name":"Joya Thome","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/xg5cotydh3Ex0jg71befyuTAh3s.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56c4accbc3a3680d57000177","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolai Thome","original_name":"Nicolai Thome","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56c4ace692514124580001b6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2012874,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Groben","original_name":"Barbara Groben","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6507fd30109dec00eb16f915","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579093,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Eva Hartmann","original_name":"Eva Hartmann","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6507fd3e3cd12c00eb454b2c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1149667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serpil Turhan","original_name":"Serpil Turhan","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/zmkfG3qCeAojvtcxwvIp987sj9c.jpg","credit_id":"56c4ac3f92514124540001b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1149667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serpil Turhan","original_name":"Serpil Turhan","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/zmkfG3qCeAojvtcxwvIp987sj9c.jpg","credit_id":"56c4ac5792514124580001aa","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1149667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serpil Turhan","original_name":"Serpil Turhan","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/zmkfG3qCeAojvtcxwvIp987sj9c.jpg","credit_id":"56c49c23c3a3687207002a8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579093,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Eva Hartmann","original_name":"Eva Hartmann","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c4ac2192514124510001de","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5377278","wikidata_id":"Q26736119","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2401,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7HekNhKYnbPMpbNoAWFpUU3PzvT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1701}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
