And they were. Ian Heads wrote in the Sunday Telegraph the next day that It was a Grand Final as tough and dirty as any bar-room brawl. Alan Clarkson wrote in the Sun Herald The fare served up in the first half belonged in the Colosseum. The first half was not how the game's administrators would have wished to show-case rugby league, every tackle was loaded with menace and meant to damage. But from the melee Bob Fulton emerged and showed his unrivalled skill. Heads and Clarkson wrote of his \"towering genius\" and \"football brilliance\" respectively.","popularity":0.0372,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1973 NSWRFL Grand Final: Manly Warringah Sea Eagles Vs Cronulla Sutherland Sharks","video":true,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1973-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
