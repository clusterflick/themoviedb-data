Experimenting with a host of strange phenomena including phantoms from his past and present, Walter Hey confronts a power that could hold the key to his deepest dreams... or darkest nightmares. THE MAREY PROJECT is a challenging new work inspired by the photographic and chrono-photographic experiments of the 19th century French physiologist E. J. Marey. It is an eerie work, with intriguing whispers, reminiscent of Chris Marker’s ‘La Jetee’ (1962) in its clash of science with humanity.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marey Project","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Clayden","original_name":"James Clayden","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c5c4aec3a3680d54002c1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0472134","wikidata_id":"Q127600768","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
