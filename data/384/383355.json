In an effort to find this so called happiness, Trevor attempts to make a positive change in himself and the world around him. There's just one problem: he hates himself and the world around him. And the results are always the same for Trevor whose shallow, self-absorbed outlook makes any change nearly impossible.","popularity":0.4061,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Esoteric Productions in association with Practical Mullet","origin_country":""},{"id":73353,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stringtown Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunny Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyra Hughes Brisco","original_name":"Tyra Hughes Brisco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Paula","credit_id":"56c4e667c3a3680d540008ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Konow","original_name":"Nick Konow","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Trevor","credit_id":"56c4e681925141245100092d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Seal","original_name":"Jack Seal","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Henry","credit_id":"56c4e69f9251412449000956","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579184,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jason Klaus","original_name":"Jason Klaus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c4e5ea925141244e000897","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579184,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jason Klaus","original_name":"Jason Klaus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c4e60e9251412451000919","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1563764","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2398,"name":"narration"},{"id":10123,"name":"dark comedy"},{"id":12670,"name":"los angeles, california"},{"id":33705,"name":"agent"},{"id":179867,"name":"real estate"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
