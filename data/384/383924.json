But what a family! Léon Spilliaert, Paul Delvaux, Edgar Tytgat and his wife Maria, Luc and Paul Haessaerts. A garden, some seats and a camera that films the group of friends. They talk (given all the jollity, laughter and gestures seen it is a shame that it is a silent film). A period document only a few minutes long, a witness that puts names to faces, a reminder of a sunny afternoon. Emotion that loses itself in the moment.","popularity":0.1026,"poster_path":"/90gTt51ESKxoNihHNOrN6Y6Bfy9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1945-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meeting of Artists","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Delvaux","original_name":"Paul Delvaux","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56c9e84c925141174200802c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1581008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgard Tytgat","original_name":"Edgard Tytgat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56c9e8719251411ea8007d48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1581009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Tytgart","original_name":"Marie Tytgart","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56c9e878c3a36840870081c8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1581011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Tytgat","original_name":"Marie Tytgat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56c9e888c3a3684091007ee2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1581012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Tytgat","original_name":"Marie Tytgat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"56c9e88bc3a368408900801d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1581013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Tytgat","original_name":"Marie Tytgat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"56c9e89592514123b800100b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Haesaerts","original_name":"Paul Haesaerts","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"56c9e89fc3a3684095008189","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1581014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc Haesaerts","original_name":"Luc Haesaerts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"56c9e8ac9251411742008045","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1581015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc Haesaerts","original_name":"Luc Haesaerts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"56c9e8ae9251411ea8007d57","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Storck","original_name":"Henri Storck","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/hbOCma9IFYX4f8iNVegyEw2z5Aa.jpg","credit_id":"56c9e827c3a3684091007ec7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1373,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/90gTt51ESKxoNihHNOrN6Y6Bfy9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":915}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1945-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
