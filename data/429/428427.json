Super-objective video registration grows into the strong image of Russian national character – with its permanent awaiting for the miracle and habitual approach to real dramas. A forest on fire as a symbol of Russian hell, a military tank at a car wash and car chase in the vicinity of Kremlin shot with a dashboard cam at the same time when Boris Nemtsov, the leader of political opposition, was shot dead near Kremlin. Dashboard cam depicts life in it’s purity as an unbiased observer.","popularity":0.624,"poster_path":"/2FUojuhiPXhQn2M1H87Ym8dAjr6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nezavisni Filmski Centar Kino Klub Novi Sad","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":93038,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eight and a Half Studio","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":93039,"logo_path":"/t3fh4SpPEO4Vxk4jN2R0Jqn1joT.png","name":"Light Cone Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":127206,"logo_path":"/eFOHWRU7n4T8LN63xeNBGhWIu7h.png","name":"Novi Film","origin_country":"BA"},{"id":116146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Volia Films","origin_country":"BY"},{"id":4748,"logo_path":"/bTMeosrSiKaTPmZiTYnSDZlin5d.png","name":"Oscilloscope","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"S#!t's about to get real","title":"The Road Movie","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Doroga","type":"Original Translit Russian Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Film drogi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1716474,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmitrii Kalashnikov","original_name":"Dmitrii Kalashnikov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583f3ff4c3a368669100e94f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1808293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volia Chajkouskaya","original_name":"Volia Chajkouskaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/3Qi4sA5HWu01NQNGaWTfS4OzzWU.jpg","credit_id":"590795769251416445001521","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808294,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rustam Khairetdinov","original_name":"Rustam Khairetdinov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59079594c3a3685859001447","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808297,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian D.
