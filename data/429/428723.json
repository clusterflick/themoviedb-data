Using his camera to record a visit out east by train to spend Christmas with the family, Hancox .... used his familiarization with the annual ritual as a form of a script... Although we see the journey through the subjective judgment of Hancox’s eyes, it is his intent to transfer the material from original event to camera, to editing, and finally to the audience, so that the personal content of the film... becomes universal.” Michael Wade, Ontario Film Studies, Cinema Parallel  “It is the honesty of portrayal which is staggering, for instead of an idyllic image which many filmmakers present of themselves, Hancox presents (and thus, sees) himself without cinematic make-up... with ‘wild sync’ sound (reminiscent of an early film), and with the use of only available natural light.” Richard Stanford","popularity":0.1487,"poster_path":"/6hFansfFeo4OHqYKyhk1GTTPhcK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home for Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2200778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Hancox","original_name":"Amanda Hancox","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"sister, from Toronto","credit_id":"5fe072085b370d004044768e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scot Denton","original_name":"Scot Denton","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Amanda's husband","credit_id":"5fe072745b370d003f450edd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586352,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Hancox","original_name":"Rick Hancox","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cbtoFwOxhzzVRwxRzlbmjhAxlSD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"filmmaker","credit_id":"5fe0725aa0b6900040a495b4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2903068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Hancox","original_name":"Mary Hancox","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mom, P.E.I.","credit_id":"5fe07291d70594003f2da8d1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2903069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Hancox","original_name":"Bill Hancox","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dad, P.E.I.","credit_id":"5fe072a1764841003e6fcd8d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586352,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Hancox","original_name":"Rick Hancox","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cbtoFwOxhzzVRwxRzlbmjhAxlSD.jpg","credit_id":"584210e5c3a36876cb0000ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mgeUpdXs7ixjSFjnwHgM42oOGCz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":986,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wvBsjWRAH8J0qJ9elgaWcCtI87o.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1753}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6hFansfFeo4OHqYKyhk1GTTPhcK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":3,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hesS94h9vW6S5eHXmABGrTTcr5t.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6i0ltKgorPSpZuzGyHx3eXjeX15.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2vMNdGzCcZoYaep8VhSQELR7nAP.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"gd","file_path":"/5E4trve6zY5DaPjUXzEvqQtPusv.jpg","vote_average":1.222,"vote_count":3,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fj","file_path":"/kNLnyU8w8WVKq0nkMKUerjSlpsy.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
