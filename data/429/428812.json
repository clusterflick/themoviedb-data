His only hope is to find a place for the child, a place where he can get rid of his mother, a place where the child can stay, grow up, eat his fill and become a man. In this long race on foot through the mountains or by hitchhiking, they successively reject all the solutions that are offered, for the taste of freedom, which is more deeply rooted in them than that of security. This common feeling gradually brings them closer together, and after many incidents, they decide to face life and its uncertain future together.","popularity":0.3809,"poster_path":"/vqf6V2qKCjww75hdZaM909x5VQH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":84061,"logo_path":null,"name":"les
