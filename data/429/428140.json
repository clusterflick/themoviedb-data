Hannah went on to become an assistant and translator for some of the most powerful Tibetan lamas and a bridge between Buddhism in the East and the West.","popularity":0.5548,"poster_path":"/gfokZJ9oEydp6MZDo1Evmnp7iDL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hannah:
