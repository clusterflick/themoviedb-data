But with the beckoning holiday it seems the hatred for the group has grown. So much so that queen bitch Veronica loses her head over it...literally! Now murder has become a popularity contest thanks to Veronica's sidekick Samantha, thinking she's next. This seems true at Cameron's get-together when she gets \"unwrapped\". Now the teens have to barricade themselves and outsmart the killer. But twisted dreams and secret connections threaten their survival and lead to a most twisted finale. In this film, you'd better hold onto your limbs...or you may end up in your own stocking!","popularity":0.0836,"poster_path":"/iQfe2Q9poeSyvJofbWKVjMLL9Oi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"HOLD ONTO YOUR LIMBS!","title":"A Christmas to Dismember","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex DiSanto","original_name":"Alex DiSanto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Cameron","credit_id":"588e47ce925141183d00e72e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer McNamara","original_name":"Jennifer McNamara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Veronica","credit_id":"588e47f5c3a368749a00d6bd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex DiSanto","original_name":"Alex DiSanto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583f5525c3a368667d0128c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5247060","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iQfe2Q9poeSyvJofbWKVjMLL9Oi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
