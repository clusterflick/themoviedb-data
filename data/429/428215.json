This veteran of the experimental Dutch literary movement of the early 1950s known as the Vijftigers sees himself mainly as a poet, even though he might be more famous for his columns, short stories and public performances. He has carefully created an image of himself as a charming Sunday's child, loved by everyone. But who is he really? Director John Albert spent a year with Campert, quietly documenting his everyday life (the daily game of scrabble with his wife Deborah, a cup of tea, a cigarette, a glass of wine), as well as more intimate moments such as his admission to the hospital and conversations with his daughters and friends. He turns out to be a man of few words - at least verbally - but his poems tell a story of melancholy, mortality and approaching death. Fortunately, his writing keeps him going: \"Poetry is an act of affirmation. I affirm that I am alive.\"","popularity":0.0787,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":83908,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oogland Filmproductie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2016-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Passing Years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1250451,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Remco Campert","original_name":"Remco Campert","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"himself","credit_id":"583d6f0192514110d900e06c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582351,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Albert Jansen","original_name":"John Albert Jansen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583d6d6cc3a368359400d487","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1715916,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeroen Wolf","original_name":"Jeroen Wolf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583d6d8392514110d600e941","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582351,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Albert Jansen","original_name":"John Albert Jansen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583d6da0c3a368359d00ed74","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":582350,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annelotte Verhaagen","original_name":"Annelotte Verhaagen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583d6d9692514110d200e755","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6238198","wikidata_id":"Q31271497","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
