Its protagonist tells a story of her life-long coming out as an “oviparous person.” The video incorporates some sci-fi elements (concerning human oviparity) with its depiction of everyday life within the largest city of Kazakhstan. Through its use of humor and the quotidian, human oviparity as a mark of radical difference can be seen in relation to the demonization of transgender life in oppressive societies.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Layer: A Day in a Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruth Jenrbekova","original_name":"Ruth Jenrbekova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5840eee4c3a36865ad002b6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Vilk","original_name":"Maria Vilk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5840ef24c3a36865bf0027c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
