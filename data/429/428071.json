She (Teresa Salgueiro, ethereal voice of Madredeus) is the “swamp-flower”, protégée of a Socratic Director (and his goat Plato). In a world without women, she is kept safe from the temptations of the flesh by her strict and grotesque Aunt. The sound-track entirely played by the workers (fado and bossa nova singers) reveals parallel narratives of suspicion and conspiracy that unfold to the pace of the unconscious leading to a confrontation between Man and River. Inspired by a hypnotic story by Branquinho da Fonseca (1905-1974).","popularity":0.2296,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rio Turvo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Almeida","original_name":"David Almeida","popularity":0.0566,"profile_path":"/w2Kkd8ne7lYgfUabuXDABhKqxH6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb7e66a7d2bc1001cfb88f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Wallenstein","original_name":"José Wallenstein","popularity":0.2181,"profile_path":"/1cPisCz3h7uNDzeYhwb4RD2LYVS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb7e675bbe1dd002183a695","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel João Vieira","original_name":"Manuel João Vieira","popularity":0.1447,"profile_path":"/pvLbPDHAiUqAo3Ecau6dhvE18I.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb7e67abbe1dd002183a6b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2026985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Só","original_name":"Paula Só","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/aFr0QxVD2szGZNYa1Fb7dD5pfJS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb7e67fc3514c001e59e1d0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.P.
