Members of Ogawa Pro filmed the student movement of the late 60's; the fight by farmers to save their land from government confiscaton for the Narita airport at Sanrizuka; and the village life of a small farming community, Magino Village, in northern Japan.  These heartbreaking and sometimes funny stories have never been told on film before. Rare footage, stills, and diaries with interviews with Oshima Nagisa, Hara Kazuo and Robert Kramer make this historical inquiry visually exciting as well as valuable.","popularity":0.1416,"poster_path":"/A55iWF2RIqYdnFf0naJfHGlNtH3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56587,"logo_path":null,"name":"Barbara Hammer
