The poem has got just about everything - it is an action-packed adventure, a ghost story, a steamy romance, a morality tale and the world's first eco-poem.  Armitage follows in the footsteps of the poem's hero, Gawain, through some of Britain's most beautiful and mystical landscapes and reveals why an absurd tale of a knight beheading a green giant is as relevant and compelling today as when it was written.","popularity":0.3613,"poster_path":"/eu0guJKq3estpfy3WmpguKiJ43S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BBC Four Presents: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929491,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Armitage","original_name":"Simon Armitage","popularity":0.1004,"profile_path":"/dpU1kbszzJ28WhqUfGUuXdS4iRu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5840e8a4c3a36865af002bba","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Dunn","original_name":"Tim Dunn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5840e9009251417d53002603","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Dunn","original_name":"Tim Dunn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5840e9289251417d4d002546","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929491,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Armitage","original_name":"Simon Armitage","popularity":0.1004,"profile_path":"/dpU1kbszzJ28WhqUfGUuXdS4iRu.jpg","credit_id":"5840e935c3a36865bb002643","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":761,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eu0guJKq3estpfy3WmpguKiJ43S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
