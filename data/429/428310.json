In 2015, a Turkish woman named Maya discovers that her great grandmother was survivor of the Armenian genocide. Maya embodies the conflict as she has two enemies living in her body: one side that suffers and the other side that denies. The documentary follows Maya as she decides to go to Armenia to take part in the 100th commemoration of the genocide and to explore her conflicted identity. This film is a universal story of identity, denial, and how the experience of genocide creates a ripple effect for future generations on both sides.","popularity":0.2932,"poster_path":"/zdur1fw0JHdHU9hrLpz3U5VzZPL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Side of Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1716164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali Cesur","original_name":"Ali Cesur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Turkish Soldier","credit_id":"583e1309c3a368668a00047b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1716165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Yolyan","original_name":"Michelle Yolyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Nuriye","credit_id":"583e1313925141152d000432","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264508,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeff Dolen","original_name":"Jeff Dolen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607b38af9f37b00057a72cdd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1716162,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sherri Chung","original_name":"Sherri Chung","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607b38c0aa659e002ae900f2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1716160,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nare Mkrtchyan","original_name":"Nare Mkrtchyan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583e129cc3a368668000040e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1716160,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nare Mkrtchyan","original_name":"Nare Mkrtchyan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583e12a9c3a36866830003fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1235275,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amy Rosner","original_name":"Amy Rosner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583e12b29251411524000397","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1716161,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amy Katherine Taylor","original_name":"Amy Katherine Taylor","popularity":0.1029,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583e12c99251411521000415","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1235275,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amy Rosner","original_name":"Amy Rosner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583e12e2c3a368668a000460","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1716163,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Mikael Sharafyan","original_name":"Mikael Sharafyan","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583e12f5c3a368667d0004b0","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3923750,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Iliana Guevara","original_name":"Iliana Guevara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67931bb4feac9b7126238431","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3651660,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cristina Malavenda","original_name":"Cristina Malavenda","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67931beed5f9fe6cfc48326d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5664922","wikidata_id":"Q26828833","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1264,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zdur1fw0JHdHU9hrLpz3U5VzZPL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
