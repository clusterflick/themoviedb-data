Having lost her husband, the mother makes the heart achingly painful decision to leave her homeland, in search of safety and a brighter future for her children. Filmed over three years, the film chronicles the family's journey from the front-line in Aleppo, to a little town in Germany. Escaping the chaos and terror of their war torn homeland becomes a catalyst for a different kind of struggle; the struggle to understand your past and accept your present, to adapt to a new life, to hold on to hope, and the idea of belonging to a homeland.","popularity":0.1127,"poster_path":"/uCKb0QERHf6rXHFHXRfZwuzvDWg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67906,"logo_path":"/Ad78qLMFwcHCodkXPb2BQFfdjx2.png","name":"ITN Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"}],"release_date":"2016-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Watani: My Homeland","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Children on the Frontline: The Escape","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Das Schicksal der Kinder von Aleppo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1716167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Mettelsiefen","original_name":"Marcel Mettelsiefen","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583e141392514115240004be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6195494","wikidata_id":"Q28465129","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pNXMUzODQ1uB7vYFfS8IekbEZTk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uCKb0QERHf6rXHFHXRfZwuzvDWg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":783,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5aEHZid9aZhWAzw4OPrP0FyZ2Rj.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":522},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1156,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/jw6OqDHTdoR5R7xSkxdtW9LK1s6.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":780},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bJ2LZYl4Pj1MTp7CH3bgNN4ENbn.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":780,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ufbVlzPVkaJjv5yyEe319nT0SOk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE.tv","release_date":"2021-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
