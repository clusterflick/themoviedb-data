In this unique take on a familiar theme, a young couple assume the role of a much wealthier couple in order to spend their days with Tehran’s nouveau riche. The adventure begins with playful games that take the audience on a comic ride but it ends in horror when the young couple find themselves locked up in an apartment, facing a case of mistaken identities. At once twisted, unpredictable, funny and thrilling, Tavakkoli’s film is a masterful, beautifully acted, cleverly composed exercise in building suspense.","popularity":0.1365,"poster_path":"/qPGXQ6xndUaoakrCwtP78CNxeJX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2016-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Born
