What seems at first to be a quiet arrangement of a dead hare and peach on a table starts to decompose before our eyes. Rather than attempting to capture a moment in time, the viewer is put face to face with a speeded up decomposition of the subject matter. Taylor-Wood brings home the transience of biological life, and the viewer's mortality. This work explores the issue of temporality, an idea which permeates the artist's oeuvre, where a course of action can change radically even within the space of a few seconds.","popularity":0.1101,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Little Death","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1137903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Taylor-Johnson","original_name":"Sam Taylor-Johnson","popularity":0.319,"profile_path":"/4iWEBM7B4nANVZcRaID9XHo4tPl.jpg","credit_id":"58b57ba4c3a3685f1e00a4a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2002-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
