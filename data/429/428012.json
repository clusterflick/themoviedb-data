A lavish new drama documentary by Ric Burns, based on governor William Bradford's extraordinary eye-witness account, the Mayflower Pilgrims reveals the grim truth behind their voyage across the Atlantic.  The Pilgrims story has come to define the founding moment of America and all it stands for. Celebrated each year at Thanksgiving, it is remembered as a pious crusade aimed at founding a Puritan paradise. However their journey from a harsh, often violent part of England to a colony assured of survival less than ten years later is also one of wealth, cruelty, and entrepreneurial genius.","popularity":1.7174,"poster_path":"/vEuBTauoB0e6CrUixSJoUzmVPiw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23294,"logo_path":null,"name":"CTVC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mayflower Pilgrims: Behind The Myth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1503872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Gethings","original_name":"Rebecca Gethings","popularity":0.1659,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator - (Voice)","credit_id":"660ebfee5aadc4017c6808ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Rees","original_name":"Roger Rees","popularity":0.5344,"profile_path":"/qKWG7oxTL1JGzTzHLacsNLDAbNs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"William Bradford (Adult)","credit_id":"583b8adf925141239b001b8d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4634231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jos Brown","original_name":"Jos Brown","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"William Bradford (Adolescent)","credit_id":"660ec16633a376016482b07c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3352448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Webb","original_name":"Josh Webb","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"William Bradford (Child)","credit_id":"660ec07e9dee58014b09525b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2626929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Thorne","original_name":"James Thorne","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"John Robinson","credit_id":"660ec1bee18e3f0131a30bf8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4634235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Jure","original_name":"Matthew Jure","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"William Brewster","credit_id":"660ec210da9ef201315583b3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":572135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Lee","original_name":"Howard Lee","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/lwxInDDV2FQzx1V3IAhuiRIYJWU.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Richard Clyfton","credit_id":"660ec26e15dea0017c37d10b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ric Burns","original_name":"Ric Burns","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":"/lKRPWzp95lsKiytKT5OFHGBNLUR.jpg","credit_id":"583b8a40925141251d001b32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ric Burns","original_name":"Ric Burns","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":"/lKRPWzp95lsKiytKT5OFHGBNLUR.jpg","credit_id":"583b8a3a925141251d001b30","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2599754,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tony Lazzerini","original_name":"Tony Lazzerini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ebf5233a376016482af50","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vEuBTauoB0e6CrUixSJoUzmVPiw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8008,"name":"pilgrim"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
