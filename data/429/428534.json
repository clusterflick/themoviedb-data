She presents characters in situations of isolation and self-absorption, their familiar, even mundane, surroundings and poses belying more or less hidden states of emotional crisis. This piece explores the difficult distinctions 'between reality and unreality, life and theatre', public and private, by putting the viewer in the uncomfortable position of deciding whether the action is genuine or staged. This discomfort persists with Brontosaurus, which is clearly taking place in a private space.","popularity":0.1063,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brontosaurus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1137903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Taylor-Johnson","original_name":"Sam Taylor-Johnson","popularity":0.319,"profile_path":"/4iWEBM7B4nANVZcRaID9XHo4tPl.jpg","credit_id":"58b57be09251410a9400b02d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1995-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
