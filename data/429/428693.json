This domestic drama is enacted simultaneously on two separate projected screens—the man’s space is described by a chair standing against a blank wall, the woman’s by a fridge and a fragment of kitchen sideboard. Each participant is isolated within his and her own screen, the borders from one to the other being crossed by thrown objects such as a glass of milk or a frying pan and, occasionally, by one of the participants, who, unable to contain their rage, launches an attack across the divide. A soundtrack of tuning into a series of different radio stations accompanies the film, seeming to articulate the switching emotional tenor of the scenario as it moves through confusion, anger, sadness and resignation.","popularity":0.1766,"poster_path":"/z1nuPMzkDzPsIcliyhCEGH65EI1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travesty of a Mockery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1137903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Taylor-Johnson","original_name":"Sam Taylor-Johnson","popularity":0.319,"profile_path":"/4iWEBM7B4nANVZcRaID9XHo4tPl.jpg","credit_id":"58b57b20c3a3685eb100a532","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z1nuPMzkDzPsIcliyhCEGH65EI1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
