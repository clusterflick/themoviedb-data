This city near the Belgian capital of Brussels once attracted people seeking work from all over Europe. But it has now come to symbolize the problems plaguing the entire continent: increasing unemployment, immigration and petty crime – and a growing sense of unease. To make matters worse, rain seems to be constantly falling from the gray blanket of clouds looming over the dilapidated apartment blocks and slumbering factories. Charleroi has become a spooky place, and that feeling is only confirmed by the stories supplied by residents and passersby in this poetic film.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/gIpU84KfJMeyq0E8nIdaWn5ozLJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cœurope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Coeurope","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Troilo","original_name":"Giovanni Troilo","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58407e229251416f4100187d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2128986,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maria Fantastica Valmori","original_name":"Maria Fantastica Valmori","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d92f63cc0348b0024405cd9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Troilo","original_name":"Giovanni Troilo","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d92f68fc0348b0014408202","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6609806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":779,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gIpU84KfJMeyq0E8nIdaWn5ozLJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":584}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
