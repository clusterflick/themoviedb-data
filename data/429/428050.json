Structured in six segments, this technical tour-de-force is a pyrotechnic fusion of sound and image, in which the dynamic visual imagery fully complements and heightens Sakamoto's staccato, percussive score. Fitzgerald and Garrin merge terrestrial and interplanetary worlds, in which Sakamoto's figure becomes an integral part of the landscape. Set aloft in the surreal world of the artists' invention, Sakamoto dances, floats and walks through a hyperkinetic universe.","popularity":0.1542,"poster_path":"/koeIMcaQUtXyD4qTujctbKzLAzU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adelic Penguins","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11382,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryuichi Sakamoto","original_name":"坂本龍一","popularity":0.4488,"profile_path":"/nYMG17bYaFkyTzs37W80G0MofPd.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"583bf1179251412462006284","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nam June Paik","original_name":"Nam June Paik","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/102ydoj5whqw0yABb30lPGl0f3U.jpg","credit_id":"583bf17dc3a368617d0065fd","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kit Fitzgerald","original_name":"Kit Fitzgerald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7c6a15d861af2f0ab77988","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1651973,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Garrin","original_name":"Paul Garrin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7c6a2dab1bc70f27c1fcd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11382,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryuichi Sakamoto","original_name":"坂本龍一","popularity":0.4488,"profile_path":"/nYMG17bYaFkyTzs37W80G0MofPd.jpg","credit_id":"5fee9210bd990c003d2e8f36","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":68615,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gregg Featherman","original_name":"Gregg Featherman","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d9a2bd8d312c5569bb48a6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14393714","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":952,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/koeIMcaQUtXyD4qTujctbKzLAzU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":635}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Home Video Release","release_date":"1986-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
