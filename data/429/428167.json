She tries to establish a rhythm through every day routines such as eating,  sleeping and washing. We see one of here childhood memories-an Alsatian dog  licks a girl’s heel and rests its head between her legs- and a dream, in which she  is standing naked I a pit which could be a grave. In addition we see a magnified  symbolic version of her surroundings, particularly of insects. Shots of windows,  doors and mirrors convey a sense of menace and introspection. Thanks to measured performance by Marion van Wijk, superb lighting, black and white photography and well balanced editing. The Ants is a highly compelling and evocative film.\" (A.de Ronde)","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosemarie Blank","original_name":"Rosemarie Blank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583d3403c3a36835a200c560","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
