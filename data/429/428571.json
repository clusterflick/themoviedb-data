Faced with isolation and the threat of death from the toxic night air, she must travel across the barren landscape and find a way to send a message home. She copes with alternating emotions of hope and loneliness and encounters semblances of human presences that push and pull these feelings within her. All the while she is overshadowed by the immense monolith on the horizon, a leftover of the alien civilization that existed on the planet countless years before. Her journey transforms over time, evolving from a focus on her character in the face of impending death to a study of absence and presence, transience and endurance. Her journey towards the crash site and the giant monolith becomes a race against time as she seeks a way to leave her mark and not be forgotten.","popularity":0.3242,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75668,"logo_path":null,"name":"Student film","origin_country":""},{"id":83990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kansas City Art Institute","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melpomenos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Larkins","original_name":"Christina Larkins","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Woman","credit_id":"58407de39251416f3c0018d1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717015,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mintra Greer","original_name":"Mintra Greer","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58407d769251416f32001906","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Kisling","original_name":"Paul Kisling","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58407d899251416f32001912","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717017,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jon Lim","original_name":"Jon Lim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58407dcd9251416f2e0018e2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717022,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Brock","original_name":"Brock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58407e349251416f300019c3","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717024,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ben Davis","original_name":"Ben Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58407e72c3a36832d200180d","department":"Crew","job":"Sets & Props Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717025,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hennessey Luther","original_name":"Hennessey Luther","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58407e7ec3a36832da001766","department":"Crew","job":"Sets & Props Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717026,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Donal Gordon","original_name":"Donal Gordon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58407eb0c3a36832ba001b95","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Digital Compositors"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717027,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Sarah Hinesley","original_name":"Sarah Hinesley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58407ebcc3a36832c5001aa7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Digital Compositors"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717028,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kyle Shipman","original_name":"Kyle Shipman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58407ec9c3a36832ba001ba7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Digital Compositors"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717015,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mintra Greer","original_name":"Mintra Greer","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58407f0bc3a36832c8001a70","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717015,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mintra Greer","original_name":"Mintra Greer","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5840803ac3a36832cc001bbe","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1533,"name":"isolation"},{"id":9685,"name":"futuristic"},{"id":10158,"name":"alien planet"},{"id":10833,"name":"survivalist"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
