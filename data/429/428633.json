Joaquina Carreras sings folk song “Triste está mi rancho”, then Giménez and Suárez (“genuine northern dancers”) dive into an enthusiastic folk tap dance. After them, Julio Perceval (“delight of Buenos Aires citizens’ ears”) executes a piano solo, and “graceful interpreter” Anita Palmero sings the tango “Botarate”, by Acuña and De Cicco.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/hpz7sOrZ29UiuuQRQJ9cMfGHAMB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1929-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mosaico criollo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1474520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nedda Francy","original_name":"Nedda Francy","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/1ZE2XpszW7pMJ6yjCXTwOh0br2X.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5841413a9251417d560054b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Faust Rocha","original_name":"Miguel Faust Rocha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"58414145c3a36865af00602f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julio Perceval","original_name":"Julio Perceval","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5841414fc3a36865af00603d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3345814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Palmero","original_name":"Anita Palmero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61b69ce993828e0065566b6e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3345803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eleuterio Iribarren","original_name":"Eleuterio Iribarren","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b69ac30443c90087495ce4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2429735,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Enrique Pedro Maroni","original_name":"Enrique Pedro Maroni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oZYqFLcYsfRshX2puiEJ4KdMVrH.jpg","credit_id":"5d9f3c92f18ce7001b43d4f8","department":"Writing","job":"Dialogue"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1448560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/hpz7sOrZ29UiuuQRQJ9cMfGHAMB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/fLtdyFDQiciPiM0TukDXm4TO4Ue.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
