This time it is a successful television presenter (Jools Holland) who decides to quit at the height of his stardom. He is abducted from his apartment and brought to the village, where number 2 (a young Stephen Fry) is questioning him. The whole show has a cosy 1980's feel to it, with several bands from that period performing their music.","popularity":1.1099,"poster_path":"/griFnxWA89pri4TEe2cZ62zN9zD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25195,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tyne Tees Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1987-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Laughing Prisoner","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terence Alexander","original_name":"Terence Alexander","popularity":0.2822,"profile_path":"/5bY3OFb8VpW7ccNn6Q47z84js5M.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Head of Channel 4","credit_id":"5842dccac3a36876c0008785","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Fry","original_name":"Stephen Fry","popularity":1.3403,"profile_path":"/dH7GuUZ8QPM9RN99ak9KKOkSkdS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"No. 2","credit_id":"5842dcd59251417ed0008773","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jools Holland","original_name":"Jools Holland","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":"/e1JATtQMNq3KM2KN8mKUw4uIOkL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"No. 7","credit_id":"5842dce3c3a36876b8009a60","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Laurie","original_name":"Hugh Laurie","popularity":3.0662,"profile_path":"/akArncggHnusP5jxzMBKmJDRrMo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Assistant","credit_id":"5842dced9251417ecd008bc2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick McGoohan","original_name":"Patrick McGoohan","popularity":1.01,"profile_path":"/xtUMgFYGF7KmJg1KqiYQuwYTTe3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Number Six","credit_id":"5842dcfe9251417ed0008789","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Laurie","original_name":"Hugh Laurie","popularity":3.0662,"profile_path":"/akArncggHnusP5jxzMBKmJDRrMo.jpg","credit_id":"5842ddbac3a36876b40087ca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":183623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geoff Wonfor","original_name":"Geoff Wonfor","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/oQLI0u47o0KWbXvo11JT2qmi2qf.jpg","credit_id":"5842dd929251417eca008edb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jools Holland","original_name":"Jools Holland","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":"/e1JATtQMNq3KM2KN8mKUw4uIOkL.jpg","credit_id":"5842ddae9251417ec0008df0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rowland Rivron","original_name":"Rowland Rivron","popularity":0.2807,"profile_path":"/28CdZHCIwno3cOTYgXgjp6VYF54.jpg","credit_id":"5842ddc5c3a36876b8009aeb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Fry","original_name":"Stephen Fry","popularity":1.3403,"profile_path":"/dH7GuUZ8QPM9RN99ak9KKOkSkdS.jpg","credit_id":"5842dd9e9251417ec7008a9e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0095501","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/griFnxWA89pri4TEe2cZ62zN9zD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11931,"name":"spoof"},{"id":172514,"name":"homage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
