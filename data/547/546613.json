During the one-off special, Tony Robinson will explore life in Europe before the war, with a look at Nazi propaganda - the Olympics, leader's books and the Munich city of Nazism. The photographs from this time provide a unique record of the rise and fall of the Nazis and give Tony an opportunity to look at this well studied time in history with fresh eyes. Tony will also look at the beginning of the end, the last weeks of the war ending with the D Day invasion of Normandy in June 1944.","popularity":0.2958,"poster_path":"/zsecupRKIz4M5pC0VLCSyz1nui1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Discovery UK","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":45531,"logo_path":"/aQ7chdTN42fz0qtmih3yYnDWp4F.png","name":"SBS","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2015-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tony Robinson's Victory in Europe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Robinson","original_name":"Tony Robinson","popularity":0.4936,"profile_path":"/x8t38jqTwCSF1Gr5aBC9q1qPPKE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"669b2d7619152727778ea797","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Carey","original_name":"Julian Carey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669b2d8f0f56e155ec776d60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4719696","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hviLfizob8ZFjmJX6olyFsR7Iar.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1Y5kq930mxTDBV1Q4Ve72iZQrdw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qE7HCr6d0A96fveTvioCWDUTYLw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zsecupRKIz4M5pC0VLCSyz1nui1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":524}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
