But that was before the man from the valley lost his way and later found it back again, bearing away the little tease to the valley. While she suffered the qualms of broken faith, her father passed through a like struggle, for he felt the precepts of the \"beloved book\" had failed him. He closed the door of his cabin upon the world and the light from his window, lighting the wayfarer over the mountain path, disappeared. The struggle over, it came hack in its place in time to beckon the little tease as she left the valley behind.","popularity":0.6095,"poster_path":"/rieLmrAiNc8u4dF8PI5QKJpYb06.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Tease","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Marsh","original_name":"Mae Marsh","popularity":0.2742,"profile_path":"/1PDFSBQCwJ1yteuffEJgwSrAVra.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"The Little Tease, as an Adult","credit_id":"5b8dc93bc3a36851fa04fbc0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.
