Now 32 years old and residing in an abandoned Uruguayan slaughterhouse, Rosa has become one of Hollywood's foremost composers, specialising in Westerns. He also has a beautiful 19-year-old fiancee, Esmeralda, but he pays her little heed, instead lavishing his attentions on a black mare named Bola. One day, a group of men attired as cowboys arrive at the abattoir and kill both Rosa and Bola; an investigation is conducted, with particular suspicion!","popularity":0.4293,"poster_path":"/wPpLNJya74Oo4OZyPZjE2y8eaOU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1049,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kasander Film
