The bulk of the action consists of the steadfast heroine trying to make enough money to get the rare and costly medicine that may save her niece's life. What makes the film so thrilling is that this elemental situation allows the director and his cast of non-actors to illuminate the details of everyday life: reality and fiction dissolve into each other, and the audience achieves a heightened awareness of simple activities like the cooking of a meal, teaching a child to count in Chinese and English, visits to the doctor or the marketplace. Entirely improvised by the filmmaker and his actors.","popularity":0.2862,"poster_path":"/4cmE4RN2Qe2b5x0wqLRSgvUX9Sp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3623,"logo_path":"/v3XJT8ci1OScqcMOqd6uAExJCcV.png","name":"Kazakhfilm Studios","origin_country":"KZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Cry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Не плачь","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","title":"Жылама","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mayra Mohammed kyzy","original_name":"Mayra Mohammed kyzy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64d5829b4a4bf6013bb1b4d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bibinur Aldabergenova","original_name":"Bibinur Aldabergenova","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64d582a9d100b6011c806d61","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bakira Shakhinbayeva","original_name":"Bakira Shakhinbayeva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64d582b7f495ee02942ebc89","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3057583,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elena Gordeeva","original_name":"Elena Gordeeva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d5825fd100b600ff099fe6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1439068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amir Karakulov","original_name":"Amir Karakulov","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/sB1TJQEsmMI8VtlwdkHcztgnfmE.jpg","credit_id":"64d58256db4ed600e2b5df01","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1439068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amir Karakulov","original_name":"Amir Karakulov","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/sB1TJQEsmMI8VtlwdkHcztgnfmE.jpg","credit_id":"64d58274f495ee0293538fb3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475112,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Murat Nugmanov","original_name":"Murat Nugmanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d5827f4a4bf600e4f142a3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1360911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabit Kurmanbekov","original_name":"Sabit Kurmanbekov","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":"/dFX3GHYeJUXBoFKI6TdE8NsFGsR.jpg","credit_id":"64e38a35b77d4b113fc7f196","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1439068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amir Karakulov","original_name":"Amir Karakulov","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/sB1TJQEsmMI8VtlwdkHcztgnfmE.jpg","credit_id":"5b91748c0e0a2640530030f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0370821","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.691,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4cmE4RN2Qe2b5x0wqLRSgvUX9Sp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1990}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":3721,"name":"health"},{"id":272917,"name":"non-professional acting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"kk","note":"","release_date":"2003-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Year accurate, month and day not.","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
