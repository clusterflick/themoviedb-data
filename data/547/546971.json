Then trails of water spurt through the air to the thawing slopes and the water begins to gush, nearly causing the well in the valley to overflow.","popularity":0.2659,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":108610,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Liechti Filmproduktion","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1987-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tauwetter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","title":"atlydys","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Liechti","original_name":"Peter Liechti","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b92222ac3a3681bf300621f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549568,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Florian Eidenbenz","original_name":"Florian Eidenbenz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9222660e0a266099006f22","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Liechti","original_name":"Peter Liechti","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9221f00e0a26608f006043","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Liechti","original_name":"Peter Liechti","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b92223b9251416f6b005e23","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Liechti","original_name":"Peter Liechti","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b922294c3a3681bf6005b73","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123306,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andreas Wegmann","original_name":"Andreas Wegmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9222800e0a26609f006113","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Liechti","original_name":"Peter Liechti","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b92224b9251416f57005ac6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1795753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roman Signer","original_name":"Roman Signer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jLuPGDCtXpboZHfwbzl8tCuzZDl.jpg","credit_id":"5b9222a30e0a266099006f68","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8015750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160175,"name":"alps mountains"},{"id":160176,"name":"swiss alps"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
