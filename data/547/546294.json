This is the film that helped kick-off the anti-globalization movement. Upon release, it quickly became a standard \"audio-visual text\" for those concerned about the growing impact of multinational corporations on global affairs. The film examines how the ever-increasing concentration and velocity of capital affect employment in the U.S., shape patterns of development in the Third World, and influence our nation's foreign policy.","popularity":0.2813,"poster_path":"/ttI8uOdMOQ6Y6VE9dy0ElX6SPFt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102366,"logo_path":null,"name":"California Newsreel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Growth of Conglomerates and Their Influence on Global Affairs","title":"Controlling Interest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3751946,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larry Adelman","original_name":"Larry Adelman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646ccf27a5046e01474eac4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3751946,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larry Adelman","original_name":"Larry Adelman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646ccf3dd1857200e5a5d51d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2415538,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bruce Schmeichen","original_name":"Bruce Schmeichen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d859d6722f5d70028a7c1b0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2415538,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bruce Schmeichen","original_name":"Bruce Schmeichen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d859d8fb76cbb0027de8689","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0252342","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ttI8uOdMOQ6Y6VE9dy0ElX6SPFt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":632}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12094,"name":"business"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Public access program \"Alternative Views\", episode \"Multinationals at Large\", syndicated nationally","release_date":"1980-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
