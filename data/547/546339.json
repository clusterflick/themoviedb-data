One hot night in June 1982 at New Jersey's Capitol Theater, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, featuring Mick Taylor (Rolling Stones) on lead guitar, John McVie (Fleetwood Mac) on bass, and Colin Allen (of Rod Stewart's band) on drums, paid homage to and were joined by five blues immortals: Albert King, Etta James, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, and the 83-year-old Sippie Wallace. Each of the blues greats was backed by the Bluesbreakers, resulting in some amazing musical moments. Awesome is the only word to describe the guitar jams among Albert King, Buddy Guy, and Mick Taylor.  New audiences can enjoy every moment of greatness from that special night, when the Bluesbreakers were joined by the blues makers. The night the legends came out to play.","popularity":0.5403,"poster_path":"/6MLUHZA8hM1m20fSPyzOAS345Ks.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers - Jammin' with the Blues Greats","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Mayall","original_name":"John Mayall","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/66WFsLdk9tyNKyaMAFUQ5jwx1Qo.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b8e8c22c3a368520c063fa0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Taylor","original_name":"Mick Taylor","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/iqqljxpCFvM1hgSjzlqVN62L0cH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b8e8c3dc3a36851fd069141","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John McVie","original_name":"John McVie","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":"/xRstRdSd3Lx15JWGyjeDvMOIQaK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b8e8c4d0e0a261d68062441","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":956966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert King","original_name":"Albert King","popularity":0.0667,"profile_path":"/h7MDjQp66DU7YsuGjJ1NTkWTOFk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b8e8c610e0a261d68062458","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2121488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Allen","original_name":"Colin Allen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b8e8cd2c3a36851fa05bdb1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Etta James","original_name":"Etta James","popularity":0.0846,"profile_path":"/lJW8BlxQGB9gwMzk6926EtviXwb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5cc5060d9251412ba1fa93af","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sippie Wallace","original_name":"Sippie Wallace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5cc5062ec3a3683ad5805873","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":100709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junior Wells","original_name":"Junior Wells","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cc5063c9251415cd2f816fc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buddy Guy","original_name":"Buddy Guy","popularity":0.3283,"profile_path":"/9J2mWgbZ39QCRASLKtiTeQV23Wr.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cc508eb0e0a263743ebb550","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Len Dell'Amico","original_name":"Len Dell'Amico","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bc86eafc31d3008bcf1137","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":850,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6MLUHZA8hM1m20fSPyzOAS345Ks.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/71q1qtJfqepk9pDwpy0QIcv9dSb.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kvtAWPwZttqDB0OMt73DWtMXIZ6.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
