Once a rising star and leading expert on North Korea and nuclear disarmament, Kim fought the US government’s harsh prosecution for four years before pleading guilty to charges of mishandling classified information in violation of the Espionage Act. After losing his home, family, friends and career, Stephen recounts his time in prison and contemplates what to do with the beginning of the rest of his life. Filmed several months after Stephen’s return from prison, The Release is a follow-up to The Surrender.","popularity":0.1102,"poster_path":"/q0pt1NyaF96O48jXCFzmYI1h3k3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Release","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2122568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Kim","original_name":"Stephen Kim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b904d000e0a26659a000399","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen T.
