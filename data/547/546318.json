In spite of its impressionist and fragmentary aspect, in a poetic and musical structure, the film includes some narrative elements.  A young writer hesitates between the love for his girlfriend and the obedience to the command of the “guru” of an artistic group which requires of him, like pledge of fidelity, to kill his love partner. He executes the Death ritual in front of the sea…but in vain.","popularity":0.067,"poster_path":"/w84K73u4LvPz9TGxbTxeY3wvlwd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Départ d’Eurydice","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2121042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Perich","original_name":"Anton Perich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The Young Poet","credit_id":"5b8d6c96c3a3685202054dfe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2121043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Worth","original_name":"Michele Worth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eurydice","credit_id":"5b8d6ca4925141517b04b590","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2121040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raphaël Bassan","original_name":"Raphaël Bassan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yOPnnuO6Saxje6WqzELNND3ESa5.jpg","credit_id":"5b8d6c7d925141518704d7d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0385669","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w84K73u4LvPz9TGxbTxeY3wvlwd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
