In King-Cat, John beautifully renders the \"in-between moments\" - those instances which occupy the bulk of our lives, but can pass easily without notice: Sitting on the front porch. Peeing at a rest stop. Watching a bird. With humor, compassion and a keen eye, John shows readers what they might be missing, and in doing so inspires many to embrace life more fully. Born of the zine revolution of the late eighties/early nineties, King-Cat today is the template for cartoonists who seek to create work that is personal, well-crafted and free of outside influence.","popularity":0.0482,"poster_path":"/x8QruBOoFjdDA4F9BM2Du5kcfRc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Film About John Porcellino and King-Cat Comics","title":"Root Hog or Die: A Film About John Porcellino and King-Cat Comics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2119885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Porcellino","original_name":"John Porcellino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b8b5a130e0a261d6e02a583","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2119886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Stafford","original_name":"Dan Stafford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b8b5aa7c3a368520f02ae75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.649,"height":1156,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x8QruBOoFjdDA4F9BM2Du5kcfRc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
