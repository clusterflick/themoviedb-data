From the age of seventeen on, he traveled and lived abroad, chiefly on the European continent. He was influenced by expressionism and other modern currents in Germany and France. In the mid-twenties he converted to Catholicism, but Laxness's religious period did not last long; during a visit to America he became attracted to socialism, which would later on get him into trouble with the Icelandic authorities and eventually blacklisted in the U.S regardless of excellent sales and good reviews.","popularity":0.0533,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anti-American Wins Nobel Prize","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haukur Ingvarsson","original_name":"Haukur Ingvarsson","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6403d716392712007cb164f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atli Sigurðsson","original_name":"Atli Sigurðsson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6403d723383df200801f315e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haukur Ingvarsson","original_name":"Haukur Ingvarsson","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Interviewer","credit_id":"6403d805021cee00b4fe3a7a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Halldór Guðmundsson","original_name":"Halldór Guðmundsson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Interviewer","credit_id":"6403d813e61e6d00d532f183","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Magnúsdóttir","original_name":"Anna Magnúsdóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d7cc67dcc90085f5f580","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061690,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lydía Grétarsdóttir","original_name":"Lydía Grétarsdóttir","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d83fe61e6d007ce210a5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3918098,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sigurður Valgeirsson","original_name":"Sigurður Valgeirsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d75739271200a9f33e40","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181814,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sigurður Sverrir Pálsson","original_name":"Sigurður Sverrir Pálsson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d779136545008ce933ca","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627842,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Halldór Þorgeirsson","original_name":"Halldór Þorgeirsson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d799383df200835af4f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301971,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Úlfur Hróbjartsson","original_name":"Úlfur Hróbjartsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d7f2383df2007bc78b8d","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627842,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Halldór Þorgeirsson","original_name":"Halldór Þorgeirsson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d77e021cee0079d19fce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haukur Ingvarsson","original_name":"Haukur Ingvarsson","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d761e61e6d00c657f585","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627842,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Halldór Þorgeirsson","original_name":"Halldór Þorgeirsson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d748392712007cb16508","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944920,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georg Magnússon","original_name":"Georg Magnússon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d82a392712007cb1653b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291181,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hjörtur Svavarsson","original_name":"Hjörtur Svavarsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d81ee61e6d00d532f187","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3928858,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jóhanna Jóhannsdóttir","original_name":"Jóhanna Jóhannsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d7d967dcc90085f5f584","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944824,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tómas R.
