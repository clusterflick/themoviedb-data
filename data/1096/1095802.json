A pioneering group of scientists and conservationists sets out to discover why we have lost nearly half the Bewick population in the last twenty years. Every year, these majestic birds make one of the world's toughest migrations, across perilous land, sea and skies. Somewhere between the harsh Tundra landscape and the south of England lies the key to their disappearance. We join extreme sportswoman Sacha Dench and award-winning wildlife cameraman Benjamin Sadd, as they follow the swans over 7,000 km, on a journey that pushes both humans and swans to the limits of their endurance. Cutting-edge tracking techonology and innovative filming techniques give privileged insight into the birds' hidden world, providing stunning aerial views and the personal stories of swans, Charlotte, Daisy-Clarke and Leho.","popularity":1.8525,"poster_path":"/5wzDcV1TYyCSKn4vWoqvoECZqmb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvi≈≥"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swans: Mystery of the Missing","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul McGann","original_name":"Paul McGann","popularity":0.7532,"profile_path":"/4NAtQI30CAaJuQRiot9twe7J9t9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64054d3d43999b008428b247","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3322614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sacha Dench","original_name":"Sacha Dench","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6405527be61e6d00c658aaf3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2137866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Sadd","original_name":"Benjamin Sadd","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"640552b6021cee00b4fef31e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467939,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ruth Seymour","original_name":"Ruth Seymour","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a0086ca4f6701fe76d4f4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Dale","original_name":"Richard Dale","popularity":0.169,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a0049ca4f670095793fd3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3322614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sacha Dench","original_name":"Sacha Dench","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a006b15959f020195997e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3950770,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amber Cherry Eames","original_name":"Amber Cherry Eames","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64054e64136545008ce9f43f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3950770,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amber Cherry Eames","original_name":"Amber Cherry Eames","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64054ef567dcc9007dbf1bc5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":102179,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ray Clark","original_name":"Ray Clark","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64054eb3021cee00b4fef007","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2562156,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andi Campbell-Waite","original_name":"Andi Campbell-Waite","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64054eda392712007cb2223d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3950770,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amber Cherry Eames","original_name":"Amber Cherry Eames","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64054e51021cee00810ec228","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10139778","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1413,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5wzDcV1TYyCSKn4vWoqvoECZqmb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":959}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9902,"name":"wildlife"},{"id":10407,"name":"swan"},{"id":18007,"name":"birdwatching"},{"id":156941,"name":"paragliding"},{"id":175977,"name":"aerial photography"},{"id":188650,"name":"baby bird"},{"id":232487,"name":"wildlife photographer"},{"id":233170,"name":"bird migration"},{"id":258056,"name":"arctic wildlife"},{"id":277462,"name":"bird"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Paris Around International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The human swan  | Sacha Dench | TEDxTruro","key":"AOBixLRYYog","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2018-12-20T16:28:50.000Z","id":"640556e7021cee00b4fef6ee"}]}}}
