Rieko wishes to draw cartoons and comics that make people happy, and doodles comics of Bomberman and friends in her notebooks. An earthquake strikes during the night and ravages the city, leaving their neighbourhood a shambles. They travel to a shelter, but their parents' inability to hear and speak causes misunderstandings and conflict among the workers; Rieko helps resolve the situation while also keeping an eye on her younger sister. With support from volunteer worker Kyoko, an older girl from Tokyo, the community within the shelter begin to grow and understand one another. Rieko helps keep the younger ones amused with her drawings of Bomberman characters, including a comic of the heroes and villains putting their differences aside to help each other when the battle arena comes down on top of them.","popularity":1.599,"poster_path":"/mjNRlzv7zsnRtpH4scM4n6hFOT9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bomberman: Yuuki o Arigatou Watashi ga Mimi ni Naru","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Bomberman: Yuuki o Arigatou Watashi ga Mimi ni Naru","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Thanks for the Courage, Bomberman","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":114913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuko Sugiyama","original_name":"杉山佳寿子","popularity":0.7173,"profile_path":"/mJYbhWLVvoK6PtD1fpeGJHA8W83.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64044287e61e6d00d53335bf","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1295806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hitomi","original_name":"ひと美","popularity":6.913,"profile_path":"/pYAPFU1kVvMKkjwNydpngpGlT1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"640442df383df200d9063ed1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuya Ichijo","original_name":"一条和矢","popularity":0.4451,"profile_path":"/AnZHxb7UbYiIRMKkkP7oYFElqOg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"640442e8021cee0087f03181","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideo Ishikawa","original_name":"石川英郎","popularity":1.0842,"profile_path":"/gEjEDNGt3CHsyzFQdNqewZVbh0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"640442f2021cee00da368d19","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1246629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naoko Ishii","original_name":"Naoko Ishii","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6404430667dcc900d481b2d2","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":548002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takehiro Murozono","original_name":"室園丈裕","popularity":9.08,"profile_path":"/nxgAJkimmDyOTlIs6N75Lov3R8B.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64044310392712007cb1aab0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3949520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nanae Sumitomo","original_name":"Nanae Sumitomo","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6404432a13654500791bc371","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1147714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reiko Takagi","original_name":"高木礼子","popularity":0.6964,"profile_path":"/w8MJmhARiVyqyvjyuiK86n2im7C.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6404433567dcc9007dbeaf4b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emiko Tanada","original_name":"Emiko Tanada","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6404433f39271200d03538b9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jin Yamanoi","original_name":"山野井仁","popularity":0.4236,"profile_path":"/sYo0kbKrEN3WPXs7TyHGyekeo8J.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6404434b021cee0084710f7d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1252701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saeko Yoshizawa","original_name":"Saeko Yoshizawa","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"64044355021cee00da368d45","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1451482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norio Kajima","original_name":"鹿島典夫","popularity":0.1748,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640442d0e61e6d0086e00ced","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15869588","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/mjNRlzv7zsnRtpH4scM4n6hFOT9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1995-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
