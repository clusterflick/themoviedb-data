And it´s no wonder, because she turns in circles, stamps her feet and twists her body in every other step. She is thirty years old and has the worst case of Tourette syndrome her doctor has ever seen. At the same time she has excessive amounts of wit and humour, and constantly makes fun of herself. This documentary is made at the point where Elva has reached her limit. Her ticks have grown so powerful she can no longer take care of herself and her little son. Her last chance is a risky brain surgery where electrodes are planted deep in her brain, an operation which is still in the experimental phase for Tourette´s.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/o44YG5ahO8BPgnidpN8F1gDPZ2S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Twisted Life of Elva","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elva Dögg Gunnarsdóttir","original_name":"Elva Dögg Gunnarsdóttir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6403ce3c39271200d034f4e9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3696044,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jón Víðir Hauksson","original_name":"Jón Víðir Hauksson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403cdf8392712007cb162bd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949022,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brynja Þorgeirsdóttir","original_name":"Brynja Þorgeirsdóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403ce0e13654500ba4e31e8","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949022,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brynja Þorgeirsdóttir","original_name":"Brynja Þorgeirsdóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403cdf03927120086182901","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Egill Eðvarðsson","original_name":"Egill Eðvarðsson","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/1tchReOu82e3TulDZPCnoXegzV3.jpg","credit_id":"6403cd6639271200d034f49d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291181,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hjörtur Svavarsson","original_name":"Hjörtur Svavarsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403ce16e61e6d007ce20e43","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Egill Eðvarðsson","original_name":"Egill Eðvarðsson","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/1tchReOu82e3TulDZPCnoXegzV3.jpg","credit_id":"6403cdff39271200d034f4c5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3191524,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Amiina","original_name":"Amiina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403ce0613654500846b7444","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o44YG5ahO8BPgnidpN8F1gDPZ2S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
