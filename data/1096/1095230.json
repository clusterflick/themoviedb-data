It attempts to capture the quiet joy of making sense of one’s surroundings and heritage, regardless of how bleak, indistinct and mystifying the pretext. What remains, is a vivid image of the Reynistaður brothers’ diet and recurring apprehensions.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/i8Tg7oegcz3QlGnSjZLWlBsao9y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Haunted Trails: The Fate and Apprehension of the Reynistadurbrothers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2557829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sigurður Ingólfsson","original_name":"Sigurður Ingólfsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403e0f339271200e506c519","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2710460,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steinþór Birgisson","original_name":"Steinþór Birgisson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403e0fb39271200e506c521","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2557829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sigurður Ingólfsson","original_name":"Sigurður Ingólfsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403e0ede61e6d0086dfd31b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i8Tg7oegcz3QlGnSjZLWlBsao9y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
