The film stock had lain dormant since 1999 until it was taken to the editing room and finished in 2016. Rúnturinn 1 was filmed in three towns; Akranes, Keflavík and Blönduósi in the summer of 1999. It focuses on the youth culture of these towns and specifically the activity of “runturinn” and the rituals related to these weekend drives through the streets.This is an independent documentary that is also the first part of a trilogy. We meet the young people on the “rúntur” on Friday and Saturday nights and listen to their stories and examine the culture of “rúnturinn” in depth.","popularity":0.0841,"poster_path":"/hczdnFm0VKe0y9XdDyYyvot4NEy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rúnturinn I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","original_name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/iBTUqqjVDSio6ROLBPfkucOpEkD.jpg","credit_id":"6405258f021cee00b4fed112","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3950615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steingrímur Dúi Másson","original_name":"Steingrímur Dúi Másson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64052596392712008618c6f1","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1291957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ísold Uggadóttir","original_name":"Ísold Uggadóttir","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/bpcAjN8Fu1dGyNJR4PAdSqJBk5E.jpg","credit_id":"6405259f383df2007bc82238","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3950615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steingrímur Dúi Másson","original_name":"Steingrímur Dúi Másson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64052586e61e6d00963c754c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3950615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steingrímur Dúi Másson","original_name":"Steingrímur Dúi Másson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6405257539271200d0358cbf","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3950615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steingrímur Dúi Másson","original_name":"Steingrímur Dúi Másson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6405257b136545009e7bf154","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3950615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steingrímur Dúi Másson","original_name":"Steingrímur Dúi Másson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6405257167dcc900abdfd8c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3950615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steingrímur Dúi Másson","original_name":"Steingrímur Dúi Másson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64052580e61e6d0086e064ea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640790,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arnar Gudjónsson","original_name":"Arnar Gudjónsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640525b4021cee00847160dd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3950618,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bjarki Kaikumo","original_name":"Bjarki Kaikumo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640525ac392712007cb2033a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hczdnFm0VKe0y9XdDyYyvot4NEy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
