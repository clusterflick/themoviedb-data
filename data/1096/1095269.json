Without obtaining any official permit and due to popular demand, he started cooking too and soon had a lively restaurant which is by now one of the most prosperous in Iceland, with top reviews in the NY Times and international media; one of Reykjavík’s landmarks. Instrumental in this success is Kjartan’s jovial and hospitable character, making every guest feel at home.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sea Baron","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3948182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiríkur Guðmundsson","original_name":"Eiríkur Guðmundsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403f612383df200835b1030","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949204,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guðmundur Hrannar Eiríksson","original_name":"Guðmundur Hrannar Eiríksson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403f63b67dcc900826e3cb6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3948182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiríkur Guðmundsson","original_name":"Eiríkur Guðmundsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403f60a021cee0087f006cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2279807,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Haukur Valdimar Pálsson","original_name":"Haukur Valdimar Pálsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403f62f136545009e7b772c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1542896,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pétur Einarsson","original_name":"Pétur Einarsson","popularity":0.0699,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403f65de61e6d007ce22bac","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2279807,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Haukur Valdimar Pálsson","original_name":"Haukur Valdimar Pálsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403f651021cee0079d1badc","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2279807,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Haukur Valdimar Pálsson","original_name":"Haukur Valdimar Pálsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403f62a021cee0079d1babd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1114533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Höskuldur Eiríksson","original_name":"Höskuldur Eiríksson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403f648383df2007bc7a680","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2279807,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Haukur Valdimar Pálsson","original_name":"Haukur Valdimar Pálsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403f622e61e6d007ce22b73","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3948182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiríkur Guðmundsson","original_name":"Eiríkur Guðmundsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403f61b383df200a954de8b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
