The visual composition was made by meticulously cutting, shaping and collaging flowers onto the filmstrip. The sound treatment is created by pasting e.e. cummings’ poem “somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond,” the letters themselves forming the audio as their graphic shape is translated into sound.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/ph2rC7fx0rbNqKvmD0orwPWSYwI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"finger petals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Egan","original_name":"Kelly Egan","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403a68ae61e6d0086dfbd9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":992,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ph2rC7fx0rbNqKvmD0orwPWSYwI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":652}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
