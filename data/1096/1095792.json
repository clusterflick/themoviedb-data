Innocent play in snow soon changes into a true competition where only the best can win. Adults get involved in the rivalry between children forcing them to continue gruelling efforts. The sound of a ticking stopwatch is a perfect complement to the story. At the end of the film, one of the boys rebels and leaves the run. He is not interested in the world of adults yet.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/hivh0wYvHUzlVqY8fpYnIu0Uf1x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Olympics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bogdan Dziworski","original_name":"Bogdan Dziworski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/mklZkADo1tgsdwqdYqMBMEieHEC.jpg","credit_id":"640544a8e61e6d00963c8bf8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1074999","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1732,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hivh0wYvHUzlVqY8fpYnIu0Uf1x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1155}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
