A year after the non-violent demonstration those nine were charged and prosecuted for an ‘attack against parliament’, with reference to a sort of anti-terrorist clause in the penal code. The film is an attempt to investigate their vision: which lines of thought were pursued by those activists willing to go a few steps further than the general public 40 days before massive demonstrations overthrew Iceland’s government.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/vwwV5mX2rIiZBuMFB5dxv91Wl2i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A9ainst","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lárus Páll Birgisson","original_name":"Lárus Páll Birgisson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6403da0b39271200a9f33ed5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haukur Már Helgason","original_name":"Haukur Már Helgason","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403da18021cee0079d1a06c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haukur Már Helgason","original_name":"Haukur Már Helgason","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403da6b383df200d905fb96","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1797745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Fassbender","original_name":"Miriam Fassbender","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403da2f383df2007bc78c0b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3948143,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ingólfur Júlíusson","original_name":"Ingólfur Júlíusson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403da7313654500ba4e34ef","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949118,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Helgi J.
