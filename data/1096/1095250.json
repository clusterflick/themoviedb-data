This biography narrates Steinthors story from his childhood years in his native town Stykkisholmur, until present time. Steinthor recently celebrated his 80th birthday and has in the past few years continued his work as exhibition planner and designer. In this film we follow his present time work, designing the Icelandic Seal Center in Hvammstangi and the Volcano Museum in Stykkisholmur. Steinthor goes to visit an old friend in Stockholm. The trip brings back memories from their school years at Stockholms art academy and in Spain in the fifties.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/xTD6KGTwOswO7nMwbATeWDiHzlm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Canvas and Curtains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296975,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna Þóra Steinþórsdóttir","original_name":"Anna Þóra Steinþórsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403eb9467dcc900826e34b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296975,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna Þóra Steinþórsdóttir","original_name":"Anna Þóra Steinþórsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403ebec67dcc900abdf4cad","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949172,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Þóra Sigríður Ingólfsdóttir","original_name":"Þóra Sigríður Ingólfsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403ebf5021cee00810e2693","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296975,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna Þóra Steinþórsdóttir","original_name":"Anna Þóra Steinþórsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403ebfb383df200d9060e6b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944824,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tómas R.
