Interwoven with the story of the amazing endurance of these two men, is the history of swimming in Iceland and in particular the long and hard struggle to re-introduce the skill after it had been almost totally lost to this seafaring nation. By the 19th century it is reckoned that in the whole of Iceland no more than 6 individuals of a population of 50.000, knew how to swim.  With references to the ancient Icelandic sages, we learn through staged scenes how a local hero took on and defeated the Norwegian kin in a bout of the popular Viking sport of sea wrestling and how a mother fled after her husband was viciously killed, swimming to land with her two children.","popularity":0.2878,"poster_path":"/um6RTUYWaU7zF7xkLQrnuYUNIVc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swim for your life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ólafur Darri Ólafsson","original_name":"Ólafur Darri Ólafsson","popularity":0.4387,"profile_path":"/5ZlxkgsiKh9d4fWzR23sDf8d3HO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6403dff4e61e6d008e3fc340","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2414094,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jón Karl Helgason","original_name":"Jón Karl Helgason","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403dfff67dcc900abdf4070","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2414094,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jón Karl Helgason","original_name":"Jón Karl Helgason","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403e00439271200e506c42f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2414094,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jón Karl Helgason","original_name":"Jón Karl Helgason","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403e00a67dcc9008819e125","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2414094,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jón Karl Helgason","original_name":"Jón Karl Helgason","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403e01339271200a9f3456c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916716,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ingólfur Sv.
