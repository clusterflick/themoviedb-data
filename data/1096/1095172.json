It was commissioned for an Imperial coronation ceremony while Mozart was at work on \"Die Zauberflöte\" and was composed in great haste. Indeed, time was so short that composition of the secco recitatives was assigned to Mozart's pupil Süssmayr. As in the earlier \"Idomeneo\", Mozart sought to produce an opera seria that was dramatically viable. He enlisted the poet Mazzolà to substantially revise the Metastasio libretto, which had already been set some fifty times. The number of arias was reduced from 25 to 11, and ensembles and choruses were added to enliven the proceedings. Though perhaps not the very top-drawer Mozart, the music is wonderful.","popularity":0.2409,"poster_path":"/mi64U5IEYMjZgQD0ZKML7Ms1pLp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Clemenza di Tito","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1564110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éric Tappy","original_name":"Éric Tappy","popularity":0.0854,"profile_path":"/5Ab6cw8PYVT4tzYangxiRUJZWLL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tito","credit_id":"6403af2c13654500ba4e2a26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1003167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatiana Troyanos","original_name":"Tatiana Troyanos","popularity":0.146,"profile_path":"/nSazaO6IKNfyjfTM34VHU2qmIha.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sesto","credit_id":"6403afb2e61e6d00c657eba2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1658194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Neblett","original_name":"Carol Neblett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Vitellia","credit_id":"6403afdcce9e91009fece7c1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1155233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Howells","original_name":"Anne Howells","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":"/oXa5tbVZBs8L9PvrsKON6Us0xpO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Annio","credit_id":"6403b011e61e6d00c657ebb3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1310537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Malfitano","original_name":"Catherine Malfitano","popularity":0.2031,"profile_path":"/77r7F8vAZPnq8gaMxT4IWCMUHF4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Servilia","credit_id":"6403b04d021cee00810e0a4d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Rydl","original_name":"Kurt Rydl","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":"/61xhvdlBXlZP5VG8oowJHc1eJ7S.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Publio","credit_id":"6403b06439271200861820b2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248678,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Levine","original_name":"James Levine","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/p6ujBSZMKTc2zNCytIvvg9NKL1D.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"6403b086021cee00810e0a59","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"6403b0f5e61e6d007ce20662","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Ponnelle","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Ponnelle","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":"/mbYg4fxvHOYD9YmDuzPp3JVuBri.jpg","credit_id":"6403b0aa67dcc900abdf2e42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rV6Mc1sa1JTyARs85CrTZEGIJ9l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":2166,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mi64U5IEYMjZgQD0ZKML7Ms1pLp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
