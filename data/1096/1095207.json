Bjarni (50) and his mother Sigrún (78), Mundi (93) and young farmer Skjöldur (35) are represented in this lyrical insight into a community that stuggles with market middlemen that press down produce prices, leaving increasingly less profit for the farmers themselves and threatening the fundamentals of their existence. Despite these adversities the community refuses to throw in the towel.","popularity":0.1111,"poster_path":"/w46nf0vWaM9nx7bkRAuUgXnLk5L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adequate Beings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olaf de Fleur Johannesson","original_name":"Olaf de Fleur Johannesson","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d3c967dcc900abdf37fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olaf de Fleur Johannesson","original_name":"Olaf de Fleur Johannesson","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d3ec67dcc900d4816d0f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olaf de Fleur Johannesson","original_name":"Olaf de Fleur Johannesson","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d3f967dcc9007dbe702f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guðni Páll Sæmundsson","original_name":"Guðni Páll Sæmundsson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d402136545008ce932fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guðni Páll Sæmundsson","original_name":"Guðni Páll Sæmundsson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d41fe61e6d00d532f0a6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1113873,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bjarni Felix Bjarnason","original_name":"Bjarni Felix Bjarnason","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d428392712008d327ac2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183126,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sigurður Eyþórsson","original_name":"Sigurður Eyþórsson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d43c67dcc9007dbe7044","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3446991,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karl Henry","original_name":"Karl Henry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d444383df200a954c469","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949081,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kristín Andrea Þórðadóttir","original_name":"Kristín Andrea Þórðadóttir","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d44e67dcc9007dbe704d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guðni Páll Sæmundsson","original_name":"Guðni Páll Sæmundsson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d4593927120086182a7c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3949082,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hjörvar Rögnvaldsson","original_name":"Hjörvar Rögnvaldsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d464e61e6d0086dfc957","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1113873,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bjarni Felix Bjarnason","original_name":"Bjarni Felix Bjarnason","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d46f67dcc90085f5f498","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guðni Páll Sæmundsson","original_name":"Guðni Páll Sæmundsson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403d47be61e6d008e3fbb97","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1737085","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":766,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w46nf0vWaM9nx7bkRAuUgXnLk5L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":519}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
