Data from the Dutch crisis hotline - 113 Suicide prevention - show that nearly half of all LGBTQ+ adults in the Netherlands have entertained suicidal thoughts at some point in their lives, a figure five times higher than that for the country’s adult population in general. The number of people who have actually attempted suicide is four times higher than average. For transgender people,the figures are even more shocking. Yet within the rainbow community as a whole, the topic of suicide still seems to be taboo.The filmmakers want to break down this taboo. For the past two years, they have been following three individuals as each of them went through a jet-black period. Will they manage to get their lives back on track? Can they set an example for others in mental distress?","popularity":0.0594,"poster_path":"/8OqxaxTScHdimvzhlMRH9zoI1My.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Their Own Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2292571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Dekkers","original_name":"Tim Dekkers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640402eb67dcc900826e44b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2292571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Dekkers","original_name":"Tim Dekkers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6430569b6dea3a00d436f8d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4J1N7psdtTkSzdSekC7jTMViwLc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AdRmLdmvSu9znH4LMnx1vFmZqeU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/8OqxaxTScHdimvzhlMRH9zoI1My.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Torino Lovers Film Festival","release_date":"2023-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
