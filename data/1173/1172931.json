In 1662, Colbert (Minister of Louis XIV) bought the buildings and decided to create there the \"Royal Manufacture of Crown furniture and tapestries\", where upholsterers settled, but also painters, goldsmiths, engravers, cabinetmakers... Reserved to the furnishing of Royal Houses and diplomatic presents. To make this documentary, Alain Pol uses a new process developed by the French Lucien and Armand Roux. They had developed a color cinema technique with the \"Rouxcolor\" process, a patent filed in 1932. A simple process, which preceded the arrival of the American technicolor, less precise, but requiring special equipment for cinemas, which cut his career short.","popularity":0.0663,"poster_path":"/zX056Nf9Qu9I9dwSjBpaXCm4WO0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49757,"logo_path":"/yuuKqZMwuPV2oCLygy0Qg9dxlC4.png","name":"(ARCO) Appareils Roux de Cinématographie et d'Optique","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Tapisseries Des Gobelins","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Pol","original_name":"Alain Pol","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f2c68777d23b012e8accbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7077442","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/22HalzS7DzVWu6aTVW9lPWz4a1y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zX056Nf9Qu9I9dwSjBpaXCm4WO0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":322382,"name":"patrimoine français"},{"id":322383,"name":"artisana art"},{"id":322384,"name":"manufacture des gobelins"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
