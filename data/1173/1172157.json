The bishop of Würzburg once ordered the official exorcism of the devil inside her. In the course of the research, old audio cassettes were secured, a complete audio documentation of this exorcism, highly explosive material that provided the impetus for the documentary. The recordings, most of which can only be understood after technical equalization, show that the deadly exorcism was by no means just the mistreatment of an epilepsy patient, but a calculated staging by conservative clerics in order to overturn planned reforms. In the middle of the preparations for shooting, news broke of a new case in which a bishop officially exorcised the devil from a young woman. A woman who wants to complete Anneliese Michel's mission and show the world that Satan lives.  The film accompanies her.","popularity":0.1403,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Does Satan exist?","title":"Devil's Work And God's Contribution","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":278152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Brückner","original_name":"Christian Brückner","popularity":0.5342,"profile_path":"/yZTdWFhKUB9IhCwm62SOXc9JowJ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"64f08cc3dbbb4200fed5c6c6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helge Cramer","original_name":"Helge Cramer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f08b9d77d23b010d6bb282","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helge Cramer","original_name":"Helge Cramer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f08ba877d23b012e89ecc5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":52526,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jutta Krug","original_name":"Jutta Krug","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f08bcc77d23b01503902f9","department":"Crew","job":"Editorial Staff"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helge Cramer","original_name":"Helge Cramer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f08bf5dbbb4200c4ea15bf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1931583,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jürgen Staiger","original_name":"Jürgen Staiger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f08c1be0ca7f00cbe47426","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885050,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stefan Urlaß","original_name":"Stefan Urlaß","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f08c2eebb99d011d5a9d6b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helge Cramer","original_name":"Helge Cramer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f08c5597a4e6013895bb55","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2124316,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pascal Chavel","original_name":"Pascal Chavel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f08c6be0ca7f010de3c1d7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1881065","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
