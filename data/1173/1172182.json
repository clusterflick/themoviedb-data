A father who serves as both her mentor, and her harshest critic. A legendary trainer, in a cutthroat competition. A rollercoaster ride, filled with thrilling ups and downs that even a screenwriter would hesitate to come up with. Touché is the larger-than-life story of fencing world champion Nathalie Moellhausen, a ten-year course featuring the participation in three Olympiads as a representative of two different countries, generous doses of drama on and off the field, and above all else a bright personality transcending the noble sport’s finite popularity by far.","popularity":0.0632,"poster_path":"/k0OcSZG8gO5i9u4Ma9O8dVg3aDN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Touché","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4245266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martina Moor","original_name":"Martina Moor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f09de1dbbb4200c4ea1c35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1620316,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Beniamino Barrese","original_name":"Beniamino Barrese","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f09df477d23b00aebf036a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Savchenko","original_name":"Anna Savchenko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f09e033a9937013929f0aa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":229115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filippo Macelloni","original_name":"Filippo Macelloni","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f09e14caa508014c8b9d97","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1252,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k0OcSZG8gO5i9u4Ma9O8dVg3aDN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":835},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vgKZ5IRf51LIuLUaWVOmtQvYT6v.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"26th Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
