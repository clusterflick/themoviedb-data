Drawing inspiration from Caribbean aesthetics and Surrealist artwork, this film installation brings attention to new aspects of Roussi-Césaire’s legacy that are undocumented in the public arena, while addressing the broader question of the continued erasure of women from historical accounts. Hunt-Ehrlich’s experimental narrative artwork draws on her extensive research on the legacy of Suzanne Roussi-Césaire, a writer and anticolonial and feminist activist from Martinique who, along with her husband, Aimé Césaire, was at the forefront of the Négritude movement during the first half of the 20th century.","popularity":0.095,"poster_path":"/xgC2TFcFhuFApTDsbLlQKaRtQmC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Too Bright to See (Part I)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Too Bright to See","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2410072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madeleine Hunt-Ehrlich","original_name":"Madeleine Hunt-Ehrlich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/35HWXwJ9TV8PoIxcgcGP5zt3K0J.jpg","credit_id":"64f17f8d97a4e600c4871c5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1473,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTCaB3rjHT5rsj95pJy3e4escVf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2619}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":962,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xgC2TFcFhuFApTDsbLlQKaRtQmC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":644}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
