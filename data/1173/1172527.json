Music by Robert Curtis, Brian Eno and Tony Selvage. \"I am fascinated by the theories of Italian Renaissance philosophers who maintained that a created image = a created event, and therefore all image-makers (and image exhibitors) are responsible for the karma of the subject matter in the pictures that create (or show); and furthermore, that various images have essentially detrimental or essentially salutary effects. The imagery is structured with an introductory sequence of hypnagogic, hypnogenic flashes, an invocation by the Three Graces of the Spirits of the Four Elements (Fire, Water, Earth and Air), and a holy ritual of Aether and ecstasy for the transmutation. Dedicated to the principle that everything exists all the time and always has and always will.\"","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/5kPSB3x7BT3xUJjSD5UsB8OULZh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slow Morning Rain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1988995,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Moritz","original_name":"William Moritz","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f17c29dbbb4200ab5f2593","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5kPSB3x7BT3xUJjSD5UsB8OULZh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
