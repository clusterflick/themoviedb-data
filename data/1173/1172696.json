Instead, it’s widely believed “Jews went to their deaths like sheep to the slaughter.”  Filmed in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Israel, and the U.S., Resistance – They Fought Back provides a much-needed corrective to this myth of Jewish passivity. There were uprisings in ghettos large and small, rebellions in death camps, and thousands of Jews fought Nazis in the forests. Everywhere in Eastern Europe, Jews waged campaigns of non-violent resistance against the Nazis.","popularity":2.7708,"poster_path":"/rlhkWiQT95aYSNvVo6ecnoKNtfS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207611,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leading Edge
