Set in Guatemala, the film addresses sensitive issues such as sexuality, work, health and the lack of empathy towards people with disabilities.  As the stories intertwine, the short film highlights the importance of empathy, inclusion, and mindset change in Guatemalan society. The narrative highlights how ignorance and lack of understanding can affect the participation of people with disabilities in the social and productive life of the country. Through these moving stories, \"Disapacidad Diversa\" seeks to raise awareness and promote a positive change in the perception and treatment of the diverse disability community in Guatemala.","popularity":0.2982,"poster_path":"/invT3W4QVE2J04mvqoyeWWPUJCj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is
