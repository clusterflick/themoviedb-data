It is more human and tender but still has bite. All the old man, Sir Morosus, wants is silence.  Richard Strauss' Die schweigsame Frau was first presented in 1935; Hitler and Goebbels refused to attend because Stefan Zweig, the librettist, was a Jew and Strauss refused to remove his name from the program after the Nazis had insisted it be excised. It was a great success but was withdrawn for just that political reason after only three performances.  Presented here is the complete, with some minor tweeks, uncensored version.","popularity":0.0698,"poster_path":"/pHsxGHPuh1BK4e7fiKaejxQOXIq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":208,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silent Woman - Fisher Center at Bard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4102416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Wilson","original_name":"Harold Wilson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sir Morosus","credit_id":"64f14e6edbbb42013a231231","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4246489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jana McIntyre","original_name":"Jana McIntyre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Aminta","credit_id":"64f14e84caa50800e951fe7b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Portillo","original_name":"David Portillo","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Henry Morosus","credit_id":"64f14e99e0ca7f012eb2b38d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3047092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Nelson","original_name":"Edward Nelson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Schneidebart, the barber","credit_id":"64f14eb2ebb99d00e3e7e9a5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4246490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariana Lucas","original_name":"Ariana Lucas","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Widow Zimmerlein","credit_id":"64f14ec777d23b010d6c05c0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4246491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Anchel","original_name":"Matthew Anchel","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Vanuzzi","credit_id":"64f14ee3dbbb4200c4ea6b71","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2708828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chrystal E Williams","original_name":"Chrystal E Williams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Carlotta","credit_id":"64f14efde0ca7f010de41564","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4246494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anya Matanovic","original_name":"Anya Matanovic","popularity":0.0501,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Isotta","credit_id":"64f14f113a993700e2f80951","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4246495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Federico DeMichelis","original_name":"Federico DeMichelis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Farfallo","credit_id":"64f14f245f2b8d0139cd3313","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3669781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorell Williams","original_name":"Jorell Williams","popularity":0.1672,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Morbio","credit_id":"64f14f41e0ca7f012eb2b3fb","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116795,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Strauss","original_name":"Richard Strauss","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/yMUgur4kSGUAkMV1ujDKZoJNDri.jpg","credit_id":"64f14e2077d23b012e8a3762","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Räth","original_name":"Christian Räth","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f14e423a993700ff63ac0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":886,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pHsxGHPuh1BK4e7fiKaejxQOXIq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":591}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
