This is all yours. It’s all yours. Just run. Hold out your hand, Miru. Take it! Run faster!” a voice in her head whispers to start the day. The assistant director’s day is destined to unfold in a series of unfortunate and unlucky episodes: buying metal hair curlers, taking her three-year-old daughter to her grandmother’s, taking an actress who is having panic attacks to an interview. And then Kaspics, one of the main actors in the performance, disappears. Miru has nothing left — a day to live, a premiere to save.","popularity":0.482,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":93635,"logo_path":"/pLoHlno5S4gKUNo4FuRG8bLdaYJ.png","name":"Tasse Film","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2023-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miru Falls in Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2926174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elīna Hanzena","original_name":"Elīna Hanzena","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/686Y8KhAlraKjKRJOiobCQBRrSg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64f119745f2b8d011b4ce236","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elita Kļaviņa","original_name":"Elita Kļaviņa","popularity":0.2006,"profile_path":"/GVSB9IeXNbu245TCKO2RriTDr8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64f11992ebb99d01008b5541","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3262184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ģirts Šolis","original_name":"Ģirts Šolis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64f119a3e0ca7f00ae39370b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4246236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andris Freidenfelds","original_name":"Andris Freidenfelds","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64f119bd3a993700c5c42960","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1839986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ieva Norvele","original_name":"Ieva Norvele","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f0f1dfebb99d00c68c854f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4246231,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Inga Gaile","original_name":"Inga Gaile","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f1193977d23b00aebf26ef","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5058064,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laura Aliukonīte","original_name":"Laura Aliukonīte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67353ca329197b69875da374","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297708,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sandra Alksne","original_name":"Sandra Alksne","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67353cb7b04297f70c681ba3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699652,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ernests Ansons","original_name":"Ernests Ansons","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67353ccf29197b69875da388","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1839986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ieva Norvele","original_name":"Ieva Norvele","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67353d2dd4ffba1e8b2acbbb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2225076,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Laura Dišlere","original_name":"Laura Dišlere","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679f720e176fdb2244cb76f4","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2246394,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Zanda Landrate","original_name":"Zanda Landrate","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679f722b776edf4be39532ba","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907609,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Jurate Silakaktiņa","original_name":"Jurate Silakaktiņa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679f7286776edf4be39532f7","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1545620,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aija Bērziņa","original_name":"Aija Bērziņa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rxzhlFwjVz1BMmGYoSO39XmAug4.jpg","credit_id":"679f7305a74d8ee23b264c48","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712375,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Kseniia Halchenko","original_name":"Ксенія Гальченко","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b647b7806050f5815240c5","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34562188","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"\"In Short, Europe\" Festival","release_date":"2024-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Riga IFF","release_date":"2023-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
