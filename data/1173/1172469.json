Iven becomes a doorman in St. Pauli. 15 years later, he is visited by a young woman. She wants to know who she is and where she comes from. And she wants him to find her parents. Unwillingly, for he too has a past he would prefer to forget, Iven takes her to the village of Stegebüll on the coast. For the pair, a dramatic journey back in time begins to the fateful events in Stegebüll and the downfall of Hauke Haien and his family.","popularity":0.3259,"poster_path":"/2MhcenRbQiXrtputBdESs3dPQXC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63666,"logo_path":"/2knFxadytGjfqalQsLZtWM37SLC.png","name":"Nordfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":986,"logo_path":"/qDV8nLH9pjElZSnPmg29mzzNlTo.png","name":"ARD
