When they go to the relevant government department, they discover that there is no record of their marriage. Because there is no legal proof of their union, the couple has in a sense been living in sin. Magriet will have none of it and moves into a motel--either she must be made an honest woman once and for all, or 25 years of marriage go out of the window. In the meantime, Grandpa arrives with his pet goat in tow and only his grandson to appreciate him.","popularity":0.1754,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":207484,"logo_path":null,"name":"Suidafrikaanse
