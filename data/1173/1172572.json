Though it occasionally feels like a tourism promotion, it's an interesting little show. The piece begins with a series of local residents describing the beautiful town they call home, enthusiastically recounting all of its natural beauties. Filming in the small Slovenian town of Bovec, this feature offers a fascinating look at what happens when a major Hollywood production arrives in a sleepy European town. The piece looks at the construction of a bridge, the creation of a base camp, movie set versus mother nature, the town's history, and more.","popularity":0.0672,"poster_path":"/xkjaGSX6kFoVNFyb6E0IcUyQ9Ob.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chronicles of Narnia: Big Movie Comes to a Small Town","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5220932","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.747,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xkjaGSX6kFoVNFyb6E0IcUyQ9Ob.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":717}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
