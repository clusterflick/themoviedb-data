Starting out as a Runyonesque character actor, Sheldon Leonard went on to produce some of the most beloved and groundbreaking shows of all time, such as The Andy Griffith Show, The Danny Thomas Show, The Dick Van Dyke Show and I Spy. A rare treat, this film is a delightful retrospective of Leonard’s body of work, including priceless clips from his productions— as well as his hilarious appearances on shows such as The Jack Benny Program—and interviews with many of his friends and colleagues, including Mary Tyler Moore, Andy Griffith, Dick Van Dyke, Carl Reiner, Ron Howard and Leonard himself.","popularity":1.3853,"poster_path":"/xwIw41bEYKSnFRP3XD3fcEjxnTY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188995,"logo_path":null,"name":"716 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of the man who revolutionized the sitcom","title":"Sheldon Leonard's Wonderful Life","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Culp","original_name":"Robert Culp","popularity":1.1055,"profile_path":"/oKSP6KgD6GuCnI5bYrproZQMXGy.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64a0e04d4a52f800c994b0df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Hagan","original_name":"Earl Hagan","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64a0e07a0cb3350138fcf277","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheldon Leonard","original_name":"Sheldon Leonard","popularity":0.3425,"profile_path":"/eNJbTTD9NOQNdXS5TBAkm5Iq9v0.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64a0e0874a52f800e82dcbe2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Reiner","original_name":"Carl Reiner","popularity":0.571,"profile_path":"/hNZNrwU2qysa2ijndIgkd6yjSCt.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64a0e0958c0a48011e1caf39","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Thomas","original_name":"Danny Thomas","popularity":0.5583,"profile_path":"/xXnyAiByeVEqq24eHoP6FUy3Liu.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64a0e0a08c0a48013b3d8db9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Howard","original_name":"Ron Howard","popularity":1.6969,"profile_path":"/g3n8qduLaPO2l4kJZsV6xNMXozn.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64a0e0c00cb33500c4a61d01","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Griffith","original_name":"Andy Griffith","popularity":0.959,"profile_path":"/akaxOUO7UmxSX0Xlr6vrCNwzqt3.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64a0e0c881da39010b8b3335","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Tyler Moore","original_name":"Mary Tyler Moore","popularity":0.4909,"profile_path":"/v4tIqWFbCcvqLrFhhHbeelR5f1l.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64a0e0d0d5191f00c5067a2c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Van Dyke","original_name":"Dick Van Dyke","popularity":2.0643,"profile_path":"/qC352VsuULdYtHnATOSDjFbS6NC.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64a0e0d8d5191f01393e2fe0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Rubin","original_name":"Aaron Rubin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64a0e1ff4a52f800e82dcd50","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":127608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan Holzman","original_name":"Allan Holzman","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0df960cb335011bcbc89c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":127608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan Holzman","original_name":"Allan Holzman","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0df9f4a52f800e82dcaf2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":127608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan Holzman","original_name":"Allan Holzman","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a0dfb181da3900ad2bde7c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141498,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael T.
