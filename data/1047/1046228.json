Because she is a young woman, her parents almost never allow her to leave the house, let alone participate in activities against the Syrian regime. But she rebels anyway. She writes and sings protest songs in secret, in the hope that they will encourage others to start thinking for themselves, and to believe in a better tomorrow with more freedom. For 37 minutes, we watch and hear about what motivates this young woman. Neither she nor the people around her ever appear identifiable on-screen. Even the voices are manipulated to keep the chance of recognition to a minimum.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":57318,"logo_path":null,"name":"Proaction Film","origin_country":"SY"},{"id":107225,"logo_path":null,"name":"No Nation Films","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"}],"release_date":"2013-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morning Fears, Night Chants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2885943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana El Jeiroudi","original_name":"Diana El Jeiroudi","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/yHAZztFxCEsNc1LYp9CIVYkXjX7.jpg","credit_id":"636b918a81383100772eea27","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2885943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana El Jeiroudi","original_name":"Diana El Jeiroudi","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/yHAZztFxCEsNc1LYp9CIVYkXjX7.jpg","credit_id":"636b919881383100dd353a5c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2885943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana El Jeiroudi","original_name":"Diana El Jeiroudi","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/yHAZztFxCEsNc1LYp9CIVYkXjX7.jpg","credit_id":"636b917af14dad00c756f2b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2885943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana El Jeiroudi","original_name":"Diana El Jeiroudi","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/yHAZztFxCEsNc1LYp9CIVYkXjX7.jpg","credit_id":"636b9193d7fbda00bb8ea094","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2843393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guevara Namer","original_name":"Guevara Namer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636b918221621b009110fd10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6430220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
