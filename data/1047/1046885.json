Hope Lynes spoke to Phil Douglas from LGBTQIA+ organisation Curious Arts; grassroots promoter Hana Harrison from Art Mouse; Tracks' Sarah Wilson, who campaigns for better female representation in the music scene with her project Noisy Daughters; Chantal Herbert from feminist Black and queer-led organisation Sister Shack; and disability activist and musician Ruth Lyon.\r It’s hoped that this intimate and personal documentary will explore the starting points to beginning your own activism.","popularity":0.3149,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":185423,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art Mouse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NARC.
