He lives in Israel, but dreams of returning with modern fish farming techniques. His wife, Thérèse, sees little hope back home. She is determined to create the best possible future for their children, whatever the price may be. When their visas expire, tensions between the two arise, leading to an inevitable clash. Emmanuelle Mayer’s directorial debut is a moving documentary portrait, pieced out of ten years of intimate footage. Emphasizing the profound gap between developing Africa and the West, the film contrasts male and female narratives and raises ideas of choice versus fate.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":"/dfnF2MXzeY3iMI0evsARC3JrbLv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2019-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Fish Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":582951,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emmanuelle Mayer ","original_name":"Emmanuelle Mayer","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636bc8cb81383100772f01fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3777716,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roy Rabinowitz","original_name":"Roy Rabinowitz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636bc8ddd7fbda00e7b67553","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451448,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Noam Amit","original_name":"Noam Amit","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636bc8e921621b007dd87c3c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10681900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dfnF2MXzeY3iMI0evsARC3JrbLv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":686}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
