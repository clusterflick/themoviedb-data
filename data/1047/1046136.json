Jonas' ironic use of visual symbolism further inverts the structure and content of the fragmented fairy tale narratives, creating multiple, mirror-image reversals of the texts and their meaning. The inverted and mixed-up tales, which are intercut with Jonas' ritualistic performances, merge into a composition of transformation and sexuality that evokes the tangled subconscious of male and female desire. Jonas performs wearing a veiled doll face as she manipulates childlike objects or partners a skeleton in a danse macabre. Charged with the sublimated fears and fantasies of childhood, the tape's imagery mirrors the fairy tales in its fusion of innocence and horror, dream and nightmare.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ygAlD4BhOmdqFc4uaW06jZWAAD7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Upsidedown and Backwards","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1309429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Jonas","original_name":"Joan Jonas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/8rvC6EidwNnIVQvQgjmVdVNbTrp.jpg","credit_id":"636b3d390499f2007fea7517","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ygAlD4BhOmdqFc4uaW06jZWAAD7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1064}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
