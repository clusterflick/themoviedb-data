Posing as \"B\" movie characters, she cast herself as director, producer and protagonist, masquerading as a startling range of female identities. The stylized scenarios of these photographs were the inspiration for the staged talk-show interview format adopted here by MICA-TV, in which Carole Ann Klonarides plays the role of a quasi-talk show host/art dealer handling Sherman's photographs. As they talk, Sherman metamorphoses into the different characters that she assumes for her photos. The cinematic backgrounds are created — as in her photographs — with rear-screen slide projection, a device that conveys the visual and conceptual themes of Sherman's early work. Muzak film scores accompany the transitions.","popularity":0.0752,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cindy Sherman: An Interview","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3777052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carole Ann Klonarides","original_name":"Carole Ann Klonarides","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636b42e80499f20076da04a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3777053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Owen","original_name":"Michael Owen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636b42fed7fbda0088745a55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
