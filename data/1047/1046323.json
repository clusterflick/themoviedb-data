In Inuit culture, adopting a child from a relative, friend or acquaintance is a common practice. Marie-Hélène Cousineau, the adoptive mother of Alexandre Apak, lived in Igloolik, a small island southwest of Baffin Island in the Arctic, for many years.  This documentary, which she directed in collaboration with Mary Kunuk (an old friend and colleague), explores Inuit family relations through the personal histories of women who have experienced adoption in one way or another. In a parallel thread, the film documents the creation of an intricate felt wall-hanging that depicts key moments from their lives. All skilled seamstresses, these women of Igloolik use fabric to draw, cut, and embroider their personal life stories – an intimate portrait of family ties and a vibrant illustration of the role adoption has always played in Inuit culture","popularity":0.0687,"poster_path":"/kOPCy64u05vSUX7gtWcnTv5UeKD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88516,"logo_path":null,"name":"VTape","origin_country":""},{"id":112027,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arnait Video Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unakuluk, Dear Little One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1059534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-Hélène Cousineau","original_name":"Marie-Hélène Cousineau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"636bd8be0499f2009b477d23","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1046216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madeline Ivalu","original_name":"Madeline Ivalu","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"636bd8ce81383100abf4c5c1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3777793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Kunuk","original_name":"Mary Kunuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636bd9200499f20076da4d97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1059534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-Hélène Cousineau","original_name":"Marie-Hélène Cousineau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636bd92cf14dad007b258014","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kOPCy64u05vSUX7gtWcnTv5UeKD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"iu","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
