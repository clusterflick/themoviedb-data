At that time, the composer was faced with fierce competition, was financially stricken and on the rocks. However, he plucked up his courage while taking the waters and wrote the opera, basing it on Ariosto’s epic poem Orlando furioso. And he composed varied, colourful music, including the intimate aria “Scherza infida”, which is considered one of the special highlights of Handel’s oeuvre to this day.","popularity":0.0744,"poster_path":"/2kojALqFu0ACK0zeTtfTd2eIAq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":216,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ariodante - Wiener Staatsoper","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":130181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Connolly","original_name":"Sarah Connolly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/sZR6Pua1rScNitMsPOmINZ4If4F.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ariodante","credit_id":"636c13dd0499f200a661f392","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2925338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chen Reiss","original_name":"Chen Reiss","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ginevra","credit_id":"636c13fd21621b00cd6154a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1566959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hila Fahima","original_name":"Hila Fahima","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dalinda","credit_id":"636c142096386400917d7a04","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Dumaux","original_name":"Christophe Dumaux","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/stKEgTLXSaAOm5nqjXMyOWrfYtj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Polinesso","credit_id":"636c1439c2bcc6009b1d1a10","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1314403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rainer Trost","original_name":"Rainer Trost","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lurcanio","credit_id":"636c14536611b400763bbf54","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3778046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilhelm Schwinghammer","original_name":"Wilhelm Schwinghammer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Il Re di Scorzia","credit_id":"636c146996386400917d7a18","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David McVicar","original_name":"David McVicar","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":"/9vjLk3oylt2gN3OjqlzNKXwCxdt.jpg","credit_id":"636c13941684f700dd931e71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":906,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2kojALqFu0ACK0zeTtfTd2eIAq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":603}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
