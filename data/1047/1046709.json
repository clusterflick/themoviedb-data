She later edited the triptych into a kind of promo video, which highlights her central theme as an artist, namely the sexualization of violence in a political context. The protagonist of the film is Liad, a twenty-six-year-old Jewish citizen of Israel who studies Middle Eastern political science and also makes a living as a dominatrix. Due to her political beliefs and free thinking with regard to sexuality, she often finds herself in conflict with the laws of her own country.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2609813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Moyzes","original_name":"Tamara Moyzes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636cf0580499f2007feb2c99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
