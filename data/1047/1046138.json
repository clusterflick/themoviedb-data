Reversing the theme of the earlier Allan 'n' Allen's Complaint, which dealt with two artists and their relationships to their fathers, Paik explores Malina and Beck's relationship to their children. Interviews provide the memories of actual lives lived together, while Betsy Connors' animated sequences transcend the specific to suggest the universality of childhood. Garrin and Paik edit these elements into an electronic synthesis that is at times dizzyingly psychedelic and always affectionate towards its subjects. Infused with personal and cultural memories that evoke time and place — Janis Joplin concert footage, Living Theatre performances — Paik creates a haunting and deeply moving homage.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/eYJ5Q0Z8Yf5Y7DJYH2SwwUzwMew.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living with the Living Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nam June Paik","original_name":"Nam June Paik","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/102ydoj5whqw0yABb30lPGl0f3U.jpg","credit_id":"636b3e1021621b009ba09a23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3777038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Betsy Connors","original_name":"Betsy Connors","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636b3e32d7fbda00905c15ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1651973,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Garrin","original_name":"Paul Garrin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636b3e6267e0f700c363e73d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eYJ5Q0Z8Yf5Y7DJYH2SwwUzwMew.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
