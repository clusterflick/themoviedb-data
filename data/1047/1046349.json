This film is a fascinating look at secular, non-affiliated Jews and their connection to Judaism. Many of them grew up in homes that had a Christmas tree as well as Chanukiahs. They often celebrate the rituals and observances of Christian holidays as well as Jewish ones. Are these assimilated Jews a vanishing species, or do they simply have a way of looking at their Judaism through a different lens? Jules Feiffer, father of the filmmaker, offers fascinating observations and comments on his own upbringing.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matzo & Mistletoe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3777805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Feiffer","original_name":"Kate Feiffer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636bdccb1684f700c4e9755d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
