For 28 years, she was the best-kept secret in the Jewish world. Even though Syrian Jews were denied the right to emigrate, they had heard that there was a mysterious woman called \"Mrs. Judy\" who was working secretly to help them. To the world around her, Judy Feld Carr was a mother of six, a musicologist, and a synagogue president in Toronto, Canada. Clandestinely, she was a one-woman secret organization, who succeeded in enabling 3,228 Jews to be brought to freedom. Most of those rescued had no idea who was responsible for their release. Her amazing story is told for the first time on film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miss Judy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3777836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eyal Tavor","original_name":"Eyal Tavor","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636be0ceffd44d00b4a4c7b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
