In 2002, about one thousand people gathered at Woomera to protest about the Governmentâ€™s policy of mandatory detention for asylum seekers. When the protestors erect a temporary camp two hundred metres from the centre, the federal police arrive to dismantle their efforts; when they meet resistance, a scuffle ensues. Despite this, the protestors make it over to the interior camp fence and talk to the detainees, who are clearly perturbed and distressed by their ongoing imprisonment. A chaotic scene ensues with detainees attempting to escape, aided by the protestors, as the police try to stop the action. This locally made work is a telling document about a particularly contentious chapter in Australian history that continues to divide opinions about this policy.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woomera 2002","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7208304","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
