From the eyes of Bùi Đình Hạc and Nguyễn Đăng Bẩy, Hanoi is a promise: a Hanoi after the event of Điện Biên Phủ. Under the “sky of freedom”, to cite the commentary, panoramas of the capital’s renown landmarks unfold like a series of postcards. A harmonious world where nature and heritage of then and now coexist. In long shots, at a small scale, people can be seen dressing neatly, working and playing with delight. Hope is an obvious choice. A sense of future glimmers amidst vast expanses of open space.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phong Cảnh Hà Nội","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","title":"Phong Cảnh Hà Nội","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2157657,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nguyễn Đăng Bảy","original_name":"Nguyễn Đăng Bảy","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/jGto9lVAbtTV1r44E5sAzMwrxuF.jpg","credit_id":"65062427109dec012d888563","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bùi Đình Hạc","original_name":"Bùi Đình Hạc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qJTIJH4u26nGKyjDL0S7geU3W18.jpg","credit_id":"65062448109dec00aeaf4f1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
