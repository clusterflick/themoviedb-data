Along the way, Yoffe looks at how the city’s streets and monuments reflect the diverse cultures that were welcomed by the ‘White City.’ As the demonstration grows, the call builds for the city to welcome its newest residents. An expertly-crafted documentary that looks at how a demonstration for tolerance of Tel Aviv’s most recent arrivals fits with the history of the city, as shaped by Jewish immigrants from around the world.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Demonstration in the White City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2396181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tal Haim Yoffe","original_name":"Tal Haim Yoffe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636acede6dc5070081efc5fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
