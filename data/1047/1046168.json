She plays the spritely titled character, brandishing a fresh image. The film is an adaptation of the literary classic Romance of the Western Chamber, in which the Prime Minister's daughter (Law Yim-hing), under siege from rebel soldiers, is rescued by a plan formulated by a poor scholar (Law Kim-long), with whom she is in love. But her mother (Poon Yat On) reneges afterwards on her promise to let the rescuer marry the daughter, and the clever Red Maid steps up as go-between, devising a series of sharp-witted tactics to help the lovers.","popularity":0.3102,"poster_path":"/7183q7hJPIzINBpn5V3CXmKZkQc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tao Yuen Motion Picture Development
