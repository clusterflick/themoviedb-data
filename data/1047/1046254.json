Over the past five years, U.S. Congress has raised the political price of transferring detainees-even those held without charges and already cleared for release. Some of those still stuck at Guantanamo Bay are on hunger strike as their loved ones campaigned for their freedom. Other former detainees are back in Yemen. Have they been tempted to \"return to the battlefield\" as Congress warns? Did years of detention, isolation and torture make them want to seek revenge against the United States? And how are they rebuilding their lives? Fault Lines travels to Yemen to explore the consequences of the U.S. policy of indefinite detention.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life After Guantanamo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Schmidt","original_name":"Andrea Schmidt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636ba279d7fbda00bb8ea8f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saeed Taji Farouky","original_name":"Saeed Taji Farouky","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/mGmeIikVSMsAUVcZGEFpODlwqS.jpg","credit_id":"636ba2840499f2007feaabcb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6351766","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
