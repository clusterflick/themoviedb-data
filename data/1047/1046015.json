The film deals with the political impact that the Castro regime had on these people, their lives and their culture. It also profiles the community still living there – looking at their fight to maintain closeness to their Jewish roots and practice their Judaism, as well as tracing how they arrived in Cuba. A fascinating and fresh portrait of a little known group in a country fraught with political turmoil.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cuba: Beyond the Pearl of the Antilles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":549100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Anthony Pizzuto","original_name":"David Anthony Pizzuto","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":"/t2MoDuQcW7CNn0BuSabOflBPNW1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"636acd22180dea0079a8cc6b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3776577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joycelyn Bejar","original_name":"Joycelyn Bejar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636acd41c56d2d0083101479","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0457315","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
