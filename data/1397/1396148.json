Language UnBecoming A Lady is both camp and very real and earthy. It’s a measure of the writing and Myles Breen’s performance – in particular, how he slips in and out of high camp and then into a more grounded, concrete self in order to distil the complexity of Bobby – that the play cuts the right balance between sentimentality and artistry. It not only tells the tale of a gay man’s progress into maturity but we also get a touching historical journey through the Ireland of the last 30 years and how our perspective and humanity has changed for the better.\" - Irish Theatre Magazine","popularity":0.0479,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myles Breen: Unbecoming a Lady","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1078697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myles Breen","original_name":"Myles Breen","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/1HW4oEeWdeHf5LbP6Dp19PwfQD2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bobby","credit_id":"674cbea0ddab51561263157f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5093666,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Lynch","original_name":"Richard Lynch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674cbeb27c1d698b7df7debb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5085290,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Miriam Garcia Mortell","original_name":"Miriam Garcia Mortell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674cbec7d57747f2115782f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5093671,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary O’Donnell","original_name":"Gary O’Donnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674cbed9562b030bb5adbe71","department":"Production","job":"Production Runner"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5093674,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jonathan Baynes","original_name":"Jonathan Baynes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674cbf0b05af10015fb81bb4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5093675,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Byron O’Brien","original_name":"Byron O’Brien","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674cbf1de7d6f8292e0b75aa","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
