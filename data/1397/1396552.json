This film shows Patel's father speaking about his work in his coach building factory in Bolton. Patel then restaged it, performing his father's words, accent, mannerisms and movements in an empty studio. Patel is a skilled mimic and physical performer, but this work goes beyond mere imitation. It speaks of family relationships and expectations, different generational opportunities, inheritance, work and labour, the loss of industry and skills and father/son relationships.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Dance like your Dad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1959915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hetain Patel","original_name":"Hetain Patel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674e02f323df960dc4cd707c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
