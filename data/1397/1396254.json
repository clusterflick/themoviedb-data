The organic heat causes an intense elimination of sweat, and the ammonia brings the patient back to consciousness. The \"where am I\" that follows and the short-circuiting, in the ethylic haze, of the dazzle of the first sun on the snow and the disgust of finding oneself in manure: this is the crucial moment of the borderline experience portrayed in the film. Death and resurrection, steeped not in mystery but in elementary chemistry, which, through its excess, opens the mind to the terrible presence of reality. A tribute to the strong primal character of the Alsatian in his stubborn resistance to all worldly things, and his fierce anchoring to the world.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mescht und Schnee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5094286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Adamiec","original_name":"Martin Adamiec","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"674d1fe975cd01706a7cd190","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5094287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Michel Clavey","original_name":"Jean-Michel Clavey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"674d1ff1ddab515612632385","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5094288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Rapp","original_name":"Roger Rapp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"674d1ff9465c6ba6dd93bd6c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5094289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Breinlen","original_name":"Jean Breinlen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"674d20059e7f6f73f301465b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5094290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Breinlen","original_name":"Marcel Breinlen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"674d200cddab515612632399","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5094291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmond Debenath","original_name":"Edmond Debenath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"674d202075cd01706a7cd19e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5094292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jules Debenath","original_name":"Jules Debenath","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"674d2029f313bac2f7a96d75","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5094293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Cunat","original_name":"Robert Cunat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"674d2034f313bac2f7a96d85","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5094294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marius Noll","original_name":"Marius Noll","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"674d203febb92e4a7e0479f4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5094296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Claude Wihl","original_name":"Jean-Claude Wihl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"674d20469e7f6f73f301467d","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156927,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Renan Pollès","original_name":"Renan Pollès","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674d2064465c6ba6dd93bd7c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5094300,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sylvain Piron","original_name":"Sylvain Piron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674d20c9ebb92e4a7e047a08","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Meichler","original_name":"Luc Meichler","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674d20e4ebb92e4a7e047a13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gisèle Rapp-Meichler","original_name":"Gisèle Rapp-Meichler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674d20eeebb92e4a7e047a18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
