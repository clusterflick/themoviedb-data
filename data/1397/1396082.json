Unbeknownst to Tak, Ling becomes pregnant and is cruelly cast out of her employer’s household, facing the stigma of unmarried motherhood. Tragedy soon follows as her child suffers from an acute illness, forcing Ling into prostitution to survive. Her plight worsens when she is falsely accused of murdering a client who has, in fact, committed suicide. When Tak, now a lawyer, learns of her suffering, he returns to seek justice for her.","popularity":0.0659,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":246129,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jianguo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1948-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"the story in Guangzhou and Hong Kong","title":"A Reborn Romantic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1408322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pak Wan","original_name":"Pak Wan","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/azuZHfMqn5CdmeLfjSFok62obDl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"李維德","credit_id":"674c9a9d654ee6144ac1d5f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1698118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pak Yin","original_name":"Pak Yin","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/jdAdm8QBL0mBBE6h4LjlwjjwNv7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"阿玲","credit_id":"674c9ada83912195675457df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1699272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ho Chung-Fong","original_name":"Ho Chung-Fong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"姑媽","credit_id":"674c9b161616b4a858c7bf6b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3567651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hung Chung-Ho","original_name":"Hung Chung-Ho","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674c9b2a6a0b9e9f0fc45c4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2618484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lihen Gao","original_name":"Lihen Gao","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/c3Qx3JujiR46lpzmXx0m68OWODC.jpg","credit_id":"674c9b3f52a9951a00982575","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5093330,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"孫潔","original_name":"孫潔","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674c9b4e57a0e50a05e902fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
