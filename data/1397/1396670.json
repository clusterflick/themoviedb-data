Divided into four chapters, the narrative immerses us in the everyday life of her home, a space filled with memories and remnants that reflect what once was and what remains. Among antique furniture and objects steeped in history, we witness the protagonist navigating her present while confronting the inevitable decline of her body and mind. This journey portrays, in a raw yet poetic way, the duality of existence: the beauty and the hardship of growing old.","popularity":0.1202,"poster_path":"/uXyTHGzAnjVV8TRXAky3kL8OdNS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246240,"logo_path":null,"name":"Escuela Regional Cuyo de Cine y Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2024-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Unveiling the cost of life through the beauty and fragility of growing old.","title":"Cuota No Mortuoria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5095995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Inés Arenas","original_name":"María Inés Arenas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"María Inés","credit_id":"674e5d4f83871727d139ca79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5096039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Manual Ongay","original_name":"Juan Manual Ongay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"El Hombre","credit_id":"674e6445b4fe47e7a485ce2d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5095996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Pablo Pons","original_name":"Juan Pablo Pons","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Juan","credit_id":"674e655bf595235acbe3ada6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5096074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Lourdes Vargas","original_name":"María Lourdes Vargas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"María Inés","credit_id":"674e680c679ec15328825801","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5095996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Pablo Pons","original_name":"Juan Pablo Pons","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674e5d66b4fe47e7a485cd1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5095998,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Agustin Duprat","original_name":"Agustin Duprat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674e5d75b4fe47e7a485cd36","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5095999,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Consuelo Ongay","original_name":"Consuelo Ongay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674e5d88af89ed76237dea83","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5096000,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joaquin Barriento","original_name":"Joaquin Barriento","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674e5d9e83871727d139cb7d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5096002,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcos Berná","original_name":"Marcos Berná","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674e5db4aa4c1e2413a1e5f1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5095996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Pablo Pons","original_name":"Juan Pablo Pons","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674e66099029a1fcc36aa0bf","department":"Writing","job":"Author"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pJjsoyM4xI8bcMbTNnaPlVAPYCH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uXyTHGzAnjVV8TRXAky3kL8OdNS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5609,"name":"nostalgia"},{"id":288075,"name":"immersive"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"+13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cuota No Mortuoria - Avance","key":"qkYWC8eDhYA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-12-03T01:56:12.000Z","id":"674e656caf89ed76237ded84"}]}}}
