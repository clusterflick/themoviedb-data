At this time, childhood friends Egor and Kolya are working in a small stable. Egor has just dropped out of school, lives right in the stable and finds solace in communicating with horses. His parents and brothers do not understand him, believing that he is doing a worthless job. Ambitious and ambitious Kolya believes that in racing everything depends on the speed and agility of the horse, not considering it necessary to find a common language with them. Egor, on the contrary, always communicates with horses and sees the beauty of nature in them.","popularity":0.0564,"poster_path":"/aFdodVof63cKYhel8TmvqQWe56T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Спид Стар","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Spid Star","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2189606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Innokentiy Lukovtsev","original_name":"Innokentiy Lukovtsev","popularity":0.0675,"profile_path":"/sgbdfPWhTdTON8dKoYItKXp778p.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"674f54999b199e10f5122dcb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2186095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavel Chenyanov","original_name":"Pavel Chenyanov","popularity":0.0663,"profile_path":"/zcdRJ6hoXkJgSDn8C9Sk5UoMv4g.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"675567172378497675755fe6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2871758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavel Kolesov","original_name":"Pavel Kolesov","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6755671de3b9b3f914552979","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2284066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stepan Petrov","original_name":"Stepan Petrov","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/yC3FVvxsi6xt63fMQ86GsVIf8os.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6755672c66c89f44182bf06e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aytalina Tsypandina-Vinokurova","original_name":"Айталина Цыпандина-Винокурова","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6755673ff1829b66fbb4ea04","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2185982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Ambrosyev","original_name":"Alexey Ambrosyev","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/4o5VTYJcFcNGGOxIEBxQ09PsJBd.jpg","credit_id":"674f54c05a4d5b9682a496d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2185982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Ambrosyev","original_name":"Alexey Ambrosyev","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/4o5VTYJcFcNGGOxIEBxQ09PsJBd.jpg","credit_id":"675567762378497675756003","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/aFdodVof63cKYhel8TmvqQWe56T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":905}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Zimny Film Festival","release_date":"2024-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
