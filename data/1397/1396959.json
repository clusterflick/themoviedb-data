Ingo Niermann asks us to rethink our response to the fearful oceans, in hope of finding its hidden soul and reaching an understanding with it. In Sea Lovers Niermann offers us a whole chest of new models for reading, touching and feeling the sea. As the seaside theme parks of the early 20th century offered us a safe encounter with the novel and unsettling technologies of the age, could an underwater amusement park allow us closer interpersonal connection with other lifeforms? And just as the domestication of animals into emotional and affective companions made the forests ‘safe’ for our comprehension, could dolphins or cephalopods become our guides to the watery depths that were once our home? Could the salty touch of the ocean itself soften us towards accepting its wild and all-encompassing embrace?","popularity":0.0641,"poster_path":"/3eA9Uej0cn6zmGxq4qCbgimfhcp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary (TBA21)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sea Lovers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5097162,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anna María Millán","original_name":"Anna María Millán","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"674f48a6b9f512a3b5b51446","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5097171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chus Martínez","original_name":"Chus Martínez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"674f48bddb04adc657622538","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5097175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franziska Aigner","original_name":"Franziska Aigner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"674f48eed57a1c4329156a74","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3841377,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Bodan","original_name":"Dan Bodan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"674f48f785b5d0366d2a1a66","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingo Niermann","original_name":"Ingo Niermann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f47fc941c2b7ab3657ee1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingo Niermann","original_name":"Ingo Niermann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f4802db04adc657622490","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Román Bayarri","original_name":"Román Bayarri","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f48305a4d5b9682a494ec","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Román Bayarri","original_name":"Román Bayarri","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f4837f42e7106fc72c6b4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2885569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Beltran","original_name":"Pierre Beltran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f484fdb04adc6576224b8","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5097162,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anna María Millán","original_name":"Anna María Millán","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f485edb04adc6576224d4","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5097164,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel Patterson","original_name":"Daniel Patterson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f4871f42e7106fc72c6e7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5097166,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza","original_name":"Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f488ddb04adc657622500","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5097179,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ville Haimala","original_name":"Ville Haimala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f4907de593d268b4b456c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingo Niermann","original_name":"Ingo Niermann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f493485b5d0366d2a1a99","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5097184,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marah J.
