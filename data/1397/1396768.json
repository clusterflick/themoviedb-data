The film includes some of the only footage taken of Clarence living within the seven-story mountain interior of his creation, which was tragically gutted by fire in the winter of 1967-68. A homage to Clarence and his more than forty years of devotion to the transmutation of cast-off objects into an environment or beauty and love.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/qF9Q6zoW0nHHY4pgKI2GcrPOsl4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clarence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jud Yalkut","original_name":"Jud Yalkut","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/10iNajtnvaDpI7HiCmv704Fmq1S.jpg","credit_id":"674eb45f679ec1532882605b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qF9Q6zoW0nHHY4pgKI2GcrPOsl4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
