No one knows about her strange powers, or that she has been picking pockets and stealing from the Undying Queen’s reservoirs for as long as she can remember. When Saeris comes face-to-face with Death himself, she inadvertently reopens a gateway between realms and is transported to a land of ice and snow. The Fae have always been the stuff of myth, of legend, of nightmares…but it turns out they’re real, and Saeris has landed herself right in the middle of a centuries-long conflict that might just get her killed.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":71170,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Cantillon Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":178464,"logo_path":"/tyHnxjQJLH6h4iDQKhN5iqebWmX.png","name":"Netflix","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Quicksilver","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5097060,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Callie Hart","original_name":"Callie Hart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f3bd187353ba1c48c69d1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56760,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elizabeth Cantillon","original_name":"Elizabeth Cantillon","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f3bdf26f07c35586198ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5097060,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Callie Hart","original_name":"Callie Hart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f3bf0d57a1c4329156857","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2328558","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
