Newspapers print special editions, radio and newsreels report about him. A film is made. Wherever he goes, thousands of people throng from all over to see him. Gröning becomes an international sensation.  Most of those who come to him are not fans or followers. They are sick people. Beaten down by war, given up on by doctors, these people had only one wish: to become healthy, free from suffering and pain. They want Bruno Gröning to help them. And he does help them. “There is no incurable‒ God is the greatest physician!” Those are his words. And the inconceivable happens.  The documentary film “The Phenomenon Bruno Gröning” traces the dramatic events of that time with original film and sound recordings, archival material, more than 50 eyewitness interviews, as well elaborate film re-enactments.  Gröning died in 1959 but extraordinary healings are still occurring today.","popularity":0.237,"poster_path":"/bsEa1UvNCsBBtbLI7nFj6JK6ne2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246308,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grete Häusler
