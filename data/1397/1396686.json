Shot in close collaboration with the latest generation of skateboarders, the film follows their efforts as they meet with city officials to fundraise, envision, and design a skatepark that seems to fit nowhere. A voiceover narration recorded by the skaters and based on city records, reveals the inefficiency of a process slowed down by outdated stereotypes about skateboarding and a thinly veiled resistance to the skateboarders. The film calls into question Northfield’s open-minded and friendly reputation in light of the community’s delay to find a place for its own youths. Making Noise bears witness to young people’s resilience and perseverance as it exposes the victories and failures of the civic process in small town America.","popularity":0.1961,"poster_path":"/KHyc4DgxqTbrzHw1k9zbc2UOU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Making
