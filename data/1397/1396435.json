Taking as a starting point this forgotten past of post-independence era and internationalism, Foreign Office, invites to reflect on history and its transmission, and on emancipation as essentially linked to poetry.  The film shows two young Algerians “re-writing” this history through images, language, and orality, articulating an historiography defined by “cinematic montage” as well as by translation as forms of writing, investigating, and reflecting on history and its resonances. ","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/w36VMhD25P7VDLH1XhBlM8WZFiC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foreign Office","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1797176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bouchra Khalili","original_name":"Bouchra Khalili","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/zI1iAch9ohq3Bk257Iq5TrsWJlZ.jpg","credit_id":"674dc7c105af10015fb840b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Archie Shepp","original_name":"Archie Shepp","popularity":0.0562,"profile_path":"/8SVzFOWvTweL9w2Aw7Ewp5Ar98c.jpg","credit_id":"674dc7cfe7d6f8292e0b9e94","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w36VMhD25P7VDLH1XhBlM8WZFiC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
