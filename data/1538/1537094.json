Before the season began, we lost Darren Millane in a tragic car accident. Doug Barwick, Premiership player in 1990, was ruled out of action when he shattered a knee, then midway through the season, Craig Kelly also injured his knee.  Through sheer guts and determination, Collingwood repeatedly shut down opposition big guns, reduced games to tight contests and greeted the final siren triumphant.  In the end the well of good fortune would dry up, but not before another stirring fightback. When the book is written about '92, Collingwood will be remembered for two things - its competitiveness and its heart.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/iWJDGq4dxNPxEb4Y8ChmvuJrpRw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180872,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian Football Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Collingwood's 1992 Season in Review","title":"Persistent 'Pies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5644878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leigh Matthews","original_name":"Leigh Matthews","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hxrxufFX7nCZubOxhfHuJfX1wcZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68afae700d20da8eab0f8eda","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5645062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Shaw","original_name":"Tony Shaw","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/eZXTTF4TgWfiJPTVPtZxYG9ptzR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68afae7c976049f3460f8d97","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5654597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gavin Crosisca","original_name":"Gavin Crosisca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68afaea166fe20e99db374b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5654600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Francis","original_name":"Tony Francis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68afaec7f181b08fe64ec1ee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5645088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Daicos","original_name":"Peter Daicos","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/zieg5Et2nTKLTpcKRolw88DIHOM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68afaee22bfc935d393d8e23","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nuJlJsN1qdydMFZyjJ05z3f2alP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iWJDGq4dxNPxEb4Y8ChmvuJrpRw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":255435,"name":"australian football league (afl)"},{"id":357670,"name":"collingwood football club"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Persistent Pies\" - 1992 Collingwood Season Review AFL video","key":"pVVaVA-uduo","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2019-03-21T04:14:25.000Z","id":"68afadf9e9baacb2e33909bd"}]}}}
