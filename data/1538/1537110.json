She lived with her mother and older sister in a community building named “Viva Family.” To outsiders, her mother seemed to excessively pamper her children, but in reality, she used various forms of violence to discipline them. At the age of 23, Nien-hua receives a strange message on Facebook from her father, who had never been present in her life. He talks about their brief marriage in a way Nien-hua has never heard before. This regret of never having met her father leads Nien-hua to decide to meet him. As the director seeks to unravel this repressed event, she discovers that each person remembers it in a vastly different way. In the search for truth, everyone reveals their own secrets and inadvertently confirms a recurring dream.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"A Long Way Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5654737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nien-Hua Wu","original_name":"吳念樺","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68afb8f5aad6432296624d63","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5654737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nien-Hua Wu","original_name":"吳念樺","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68afb87c5fd3bfa65f3d8eb2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
