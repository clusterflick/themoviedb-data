Told from Ahmed’s perspective as an Afghan expat, the film traces her journey from rejecting her heritage — which she initially connected with victimhood — to embracing it in a celebration of the heroism of Afghan women.  Featuring documentary subjects Nelofer Pazira-Fisk, Vida Samadzai, Sahar Parniyan, Mozhdah Jamalzadeh, and Shogofa Sediqi, Ahmed’s film weaves images of the past and present into intimate interviews, creating a rich, layered portrait of these women’s lives. The subjects’ voices are compelling and heartfelt, making the experiences both powerful and urgent, and Ahmed’s cinematography captures the raw beauty of these stories, reflecting 35 years of courage and perseverance. In the Room is an important film that reminds us that human rights are fragile and must be actively protected.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Room","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Vancouver International Film Festival ","release_date":"2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
