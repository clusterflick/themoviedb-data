Only one of them is a living human being; the five others hide diverse identities. Anamorphic time and space are the stage on which they confront each other and themselves.

Behind the crimes they have committed are simply lost creatures wishing desperately to be members of humanity, even for the short time of a card game.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/z1JGg0dZDBmQIG7vJy43pm3Apuh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Songs of the Day After","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3007581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Pariser","original_name":"Paul Pariser","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/n81xTvt5ZhtfC77MWwUhuiKjJzq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marlow Norcott","credit_id":"68b09509c542cb3916f39a1d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Davies","original_name":"Jason Davies","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ivor Lancaster","credit_id":"68b0953af97b47654cfa9b66","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Freeman","original_name":"Alex Freeman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/68t0ZtjfAahH6yRhDq3vyLQLxnC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Leland Quinton","credit_id":"68b0954dbd58ecaad1391112","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3256369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maya Diehm","original_name":"Maya Diehm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jasna Kaminska","credit_id":"68b0955d2c5f1c61ddf3917d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5655898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grégory Good","original_name":"Grégory Good","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Tobias Wolliver","credit_id":"68b095a1c4a5ea529df39b7e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5655936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Ros","original_name":"Brandon Ros","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Arawn","credit_id":"68b095b8de3f3582386250ca","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5655888,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barbara Glas","original_name":"Barbara Glas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b094dad98a678ffafa9a03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5655888,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barbara Glas","original_name":"Barbara Glas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b094f4a17bf49ee2fa9b05","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9699002","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":837,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z1JGg0dZDBmQIG7vJy43pm3Apuh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":558}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
