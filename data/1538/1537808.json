Inspired in William Golding's novel Lord of the Flies, the artist asked the pupils to turn the school hall into a desert island, and to relate themselves to such new territory. The video documents the children's organisational methods, their approaches to the problematics raised by self-governance and by the possibility of imagining institutions and social relations from scratch.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/z0dLGygkcS4hF3JXDt6ZDmkwho7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Postcards from the Desert Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adelita Husni-Bey","original_name":"Adelita Husni-Bey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b18d23d2e2d1f954b4e71d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z0dLGygkcS4hF3JXDt6ZDmkwho7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
