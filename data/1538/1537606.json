The film crew observes research in monasteries in India and Nepal, recording both scientific methods and the deep spiritual side of the practice. The film tries to understand whether a true dialogue between science and ancient wisdom is possible, and to come closer to understanding what we call the nature of consciousness.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/oI0iWRD2Tc2L8TnpSyeVmnQgHkP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2025-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Протокол Тукдама","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Protokol Tukdama","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5656317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Igor Yancheglov","original_name":"Игорь Янчёглов","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0d344e9baacb2e3390dc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/oI0iWRD2Tc2L8TnpSyeVmnQgHkP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOKer Moscow International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2025-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
