His son Gordian is asked by Grimaldo the magician to save the life of a Christian girl about to be thrown to the lions. He refuses, whereupon Grimaldo prophesies the fate of the Empire by telling the prince a story of the future: Two thousand years hence, in New York, a parallel situation takes place in which a young man is led to put a stop to the base plans of his father. The prince is so deeply affected by the injustice of the story that he plunges into the arena to save the girl, causing the emperor to die in a fit of rage, thus precipitating the coronation of his son as the new emperor.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bPW3N2bf4Y1XsbqUkZkwXfL8wvO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rolfe Photoplays","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jans Pictures Inc annouce the completion of a gigantic and epoch-making dramatic masterpiece!","title":"Madonnas and Men","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anders Randolf","original_name":"Anders Randolf","popularity":0.2157,"profile_path":"/huOktIxFNvOJEFe3KoBm2FretJr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Turnerius / Marshall Turner","credit_id":"68afbca1ce7d810a830f8e0b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Lowe","original_name":"Edmund Lowe","popularity":1.6496,"profile_path":"/8aDjzC5moz2NQZ8aBhBn5bmuFXj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gordion / Gordon Turner","credit_id":"68afbcb02bbccbd4a7b3760a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustav von Seyffertitz","original_name":"Gustav von Seyffertitz","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/849KvertinEPsW09lOgXAza44F2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Grimaldo / John Grimm","credit_id":"68afbcdd380904d33c3d8e33","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raye Dean","original_name":"Raye Dean","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Laurentia / Laura Grimm","credit_id":"68afbcec163a301dd256bccd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5057442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan-Burroughs Fontaine","original_name":"Evan-Burroughs Fontaine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nerissa / Ninon","credit_id":"68afbcfd5fd3bfa65f3d8ed1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1360619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanche Davenport","original_name":"Blanche Davenport","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Grimm","credit_id":"68afbd0d7b60f4d4ba4ed586","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1949239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Faire Binney","original_name":"Faire Binney","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/kmHR2ENi0sjvkFI8JgnrQYnsgr2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Patsy","credit_id":"68afbd1ac2431cc7c456bc87","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"B.A. Rolfe","original_name":"B.A. Rolfe","popularity":0.2517,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68afbd31cc50eefc3b624f78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72063,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carey Wilson","original_name":"Carey Wilson","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/pXnGTnHIJTFpHjGPFzFvmLBwoOD.jpg","credit_id":"68afbd46e59d1944eaf396e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edmund Goulding","original_name":"Edmund Goulding","popularity":0.3602,"profile_path":"/l4h95dSKe2CGNfSuAIRZn7mnwma.jpg","credit_id":"68afbd759a794e728b390a5f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1374522,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Violet Clark","original_name":"Violet Clark","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68afbd9b2f5c4a112cf396cc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362755,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Arthur A.
