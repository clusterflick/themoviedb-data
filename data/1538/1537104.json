We relive the triumphs of the fifties through Richards, Rose and Weideman. The Grand Final nightmares of the sixties and early seventies through Tuddenham, Thompson, Gabelich, Waters, and McKenna.  We follow the epic struggles of Tom Hafey and his men as they took the Magpies to the top of the ladder only to have that ultimate prize cruelly snatched from their grasp.  This is the story of a proud Football Club - there is none prouder.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/cP3qG33R6VzKRQScTxC4hbiHncd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70895,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual Entertainment Group","origin_country":""},{"id":180872,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian Football Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Old Collingwood Forever","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1236463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie McGuire","original_name":"Eddie McGuire","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/f4d8KvyQ4ZaEGdFjOBxXbzhpU8g.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself/Host","credit_id":"68afb409ca689b3abd3d8ed8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1714643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Richards","original_name":"Lou Richards","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/4Dwdi7AbQBxYMBel4DsGkbiDCOX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68afb41614a1b55e653d8e41","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1614609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Buckley","original_name":"Nathan Buckley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hESEIiYOcVDO1Y3YPH1k7HcAZYH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68afb422ce7d810a830f8dbb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4861116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Des Tuddenham","original_name":"Des Tuddenham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68afb4303bd92b0005b37591","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4861117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter McKenna","original_name":"Peter McKenna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68afb43b01ec399c9c390896","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5645062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Shaw","original_name":"Tony Shaw","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/eZXTTF4TgWfiJPTVPtZxYG9ptzR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68afb4538ddd56dc0bfa97b1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5645088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Daicos","original_name":"Peter Daicos","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/zieg5Et2nTKLTpcKRolw88DIHOM.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"68afb45e5fac1ed384390b96","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1236463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie McGuire","original_name":"Eddie McGuire","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/f4d8KvyQ4ZaEGdFjOBxXbzhpU8g.jpg","credit_id":"68afb4726936c5fe664ec113","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t5h5NMvDXSwIN53x5b2wSAA0YvC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cP3qG33R6VzKRQScTxC4hbiHncd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":255435,"name":"australian football league (afl)"},{"id":357670,"name":"collingwood football club"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Good Old Collingwood Forever: The History of the Collingwood Football Club","key":"0JIjLwAYFBw","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2016-11-18T02:30:46.000Z","id":"68afb53f6936c5fe664ec133"}]}}}
