Inspired by Charlie Chaplin’s The Gold Rush, Stalin ordered gold mining in the Soviet Union using political prisoners, appointing his film projectionist as the head of the Kolyma mines. The projectionist enthusiastically extracted gold, made bullets from it, and received the Order of Lenin. Over 70 years later, journalist Mykola Vorotnytskyi finds a businessman’s body with the Order of Lenin and a gold bullet. Despite an investigation revealing the killer, Mykola chooses not to disclose the name, prioritizing ethics over a monetary reward.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/i4NWaIawlYnQwOF5EfUldnOMHXO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":272571,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lavra Film Studio","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2003-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gold Rush","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mykhailo Belikov","original_name":"Михайло Бєліков","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":"/pALxn4qG7GyQbwAGilw1hCZMcl7.jpg","credit_id":"68b08ecf270dcb59c75ed628","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mykhailo Belikov","original_name":"Михайло Бєліков","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":"/pALxn4qG7GyQbwAGilw1hCZMcl7.jpg","credit_id":"68b08ee75060bc0a265ed743","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/i4NWaIawlYnQwOF5EfUldnOMHXO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
