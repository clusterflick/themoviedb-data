Among the stillness of the house, he finishes building a model ship left in his grandfather's workshop. Frantically completing the ship, the boy unexpectedly takes his work and sets it sail into the ocean. Caught between surreal dreams and waking life, at dawn the boy rushes back to the ocean, diving into the water, swimming to it's depths, where he discovers a life-sized sunken ship. Forced to resurface, the boy climbs out of the water, to face the rising sun and a new reality.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76343,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salazar Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ship","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolas Filipovic","original_name":"Nikolas Filipovic","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vygZewSZZAIXQxK9vWoLOGcSPX2.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Thomas","credit_id":"68b0e61ed2c74fd7e11ffa00","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Konoval","original_name":"Karin Konoval","popularity":0.2647,"profile_path":"/5e8YyNQjWre2UbExYBlJ7zva934.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mom","credit_id":"68b0e62d25c63268991b8316","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Petry","original_name":"Jeff Petry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0e3a519c21c1d2c1b8316","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Petry","original_name":"Jeff Petry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0e3ad99f2fc227954d472","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Petry","original_name":"Jeff Petry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0e3bad1a6b326ce54d477","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1926491,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jesse Savath","original_name":"Jesse Savath","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0e3c5d90ff5c5a31b8313","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205435,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edo van Breemen","original_name":"Edo van Breemen","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/gPH85EvaBejRf4QHT682mv4lW9I.jpg","credit_id":"68b0e3d6235744aa41510bd0","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558384,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stirling Bancroft","original_name":"Stirling Bancroft","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0e3e5a8177578231b8312","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914891,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aynsley Baldwin","original_name":"Aynsley Baldwin","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0e3fa6a237666db3ef04f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Drillot","original_name":"Nathan Drillot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0e407450460b491396c8f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1462300,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kara Eide","original_name":"Kara Eide","popularity":3.4853,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0e41ca5023be18b1f1424","department":"Production","job":"Casting"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1926482,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Danny Vermette","original_name":"Danny Vermette","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0e44cd7a4891111156dc1","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3573036","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
