Michael last went to space when Nico was six. During his time in orbit, their family broke apart. Although Michael returned to Earth, he never came home. Now he’s headed back to space, 15 years later. Can Nico bridge the distance before he leaves?  Equal parts interstellar and intimate, this coming-of-age story confronts two men of different generations, asking us what sacrifices we’ll make for our loved ones to achieve their dreams.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Earth to Michael","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5656365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nico López-Alegría","original_name":"Nico López-Alegría","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0dd3e29cc9a2270b37bb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5656366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"ZZ","original_name":"ZZ","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0dd4c8e4f730aed5ed7d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dustin Nakao-Haider","original_name":"Dustin Nakao-Haider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0dd678f7c185c7ef39bbe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2533793,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steffie van Rhee","original_name":"Steffie van Rhee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0dd7cc1e5e784c80f9557","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3945185,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marley McDonald","original_name":"Marley McDonald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0dd8f9192cd35686251ac","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4251698,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sammy Dane","original_name":"Sammy Dane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0dda1d645b17f6ff39c1e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792327,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Steve McCord","original_name":"Steve McCord","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0de07a5164a389879c45a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586222,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jackson Greenberg","original_name":"Jackson Greenberg","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/refGGUsFtvLQGGbICKuoE6npR0V.jpg","credit_id":"68b0de44454a0994d7a8abf5","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
