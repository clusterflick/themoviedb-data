Hoshino is an old-fashioned \"hot-blooded teacher,\" which means he uses his upbeat never-say-die attitude to bulldoze people into education. He has been assigned to a rural school as a substitute teacher, which is where he finds that his attitude might not be enough as Hoshino confronts the children of 2025 who are suffering from a variety of issues. For instance, there is Kana, who is a Highly Sensitive Person and has resorted to e-learning. Meanwhile Eita labours under a strict father whose overly-demanding attitude causes stress. As Hoshino communicates with the kids and their parents, his attitude crashes into the complications surrounding contemporary education.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2025-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mr. Hoshino Runs Again Today","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5657356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MIYAZON","original_name":"MIYAZON","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68b190fcffe875fb5e157053","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1343676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakurako Ohara","original_name":"大原櫻子","popularity":0.2449,"profile_path":"/zgezWtMVtz2L5gArqngdBc6f5uV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68b1910432213f72f41f15d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masahiro Inoue","original_name":"井上正大","popularity":0.8597,"profile_path":"/sFCfEVsFd4VmfK8irbKEFSTCKKx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68b1910cffe875fb5e157056","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5657357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shugo","original_name":"Shugo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68b1912639a2115ab81f1715","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5060366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haruhi Yamaguchi","original_name":"山口暖人","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5ejzzt1Wq95OwfiHWFqngB0etIm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68b191407c83cbc3999e1015","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5049500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuta Soma","original_name":"Yuta Soma","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b19006140789fd593cc314","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"y3vKSXjE9913004"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Osaka Asian Film Festival EXPO","release_date":"2025-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
