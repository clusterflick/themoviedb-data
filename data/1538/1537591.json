Using old photographs, recorded interviews with family members, and multiple animation techniques, the film deconstructs room-by-room a house that was a family home for more than 25 years. What begins as a biography of a house, told through bittersweet and sometimes humorous personal anecdotes, ultimately raises larger questions about the emotional content of physical spaces, and what happens to our histories when we leave those places behind.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Places Other People Have Lived","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5656275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Yilmaz","original_name":"Laura Yilmaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0c95b415c66b5895ed956","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2124019","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
