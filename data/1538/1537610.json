Anderson shot the film in Columbus County, North Carolina, where her grandmother was born and her extended family still lives today. Settled by British colonizers and named after Christopher Columbus, the area’s violent and racist history is compounded by Anderson’s own difficult familial past there. Nevertheless, it is the place where family has repeatedly gathered over the years to find moments of healing and joy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sometimes I Feel Like I Am Almost Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4553583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.J.
