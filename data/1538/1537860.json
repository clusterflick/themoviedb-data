They met at university and have since pursued filmmaking together. They like having fun and they like filming funny things and laughing together. They want to fly a jam sandwich. They want to shoplift a film camera. They want to trace Sora's family roots in Okinawa. The two sublimate their desires to filmmaking. For the two, film is like a magic wand. They transform it into all kinds of genres and put themselves in it. The two desire to know each other, but never compromise and, instead, accept their uncertain identities just to have the greatest conversation.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/8eCSnOkLrjI8bHztTOIz0k5hP8I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2025-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What's our next move?","title":"PEAK END","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5385839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shin Chae-rin","original_name":"신채린","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68b1a87370375c72d6396fc3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5657526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sola Itami","original_name":"Sola Itami","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68b1a8929914898fd539706d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5385839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shin Chae-rin","original_name":"신채린","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b1a8578d2000d3573cc407","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"peak__end__","twitter_id":"PEAK_END_"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1522,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8eCSnOkLrjI8bHztTOIz0k5hP8I.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1076},{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zgX1fBYShiEyLRNIq7ewqZKlGE6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":858}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sakyo, Kyoto","release_date":"2025-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
