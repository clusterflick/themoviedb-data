The term Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) is well-known due to this. While the media has always acknowledged the big sacrifices that OFWs make in order to provide for their children an opportunity to live a better life than what they were given, no one talks about the perspective of the children who are left behind, having to grow up and face life without the presence of their parents.  This film features Joanna, a Filipina in her mid-20s who has little to no connection left with her OFW mother. As she faces adulthood, she must decide if she wants to let go of her past. Bahay-Bahayan follows Joanna as she reels back to her past through memory and nostalgia.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/5YOQJ9VivKh8vOKht65ADfAW7Mt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There are always two sides to a story.","title":"Bahay-Bahayan (echoes beyond the horizon)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5657686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Rose Tamba","original_name":"Joanna Rose Tamba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"as Herself","credit_id":"68b1bf675c311d82203cc4ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5657688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Nicole Gallosa","original_name":"Sophia Nicole Gallosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"as Herself","credit_id":"68b1bf71f7e44399ae396fb8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5657689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marienne Louise","original_name":"Marienne Louise","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b1bf7fefe171002ab4e97f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5657690,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Muhammad Raihan Bin Mohammed Rasul","original_name":"Muhammad Raihan Bin Mohammed Rasul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b1bf925d4b26d95d157203","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5657692,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Caganap Janna","original_name":"Caganap Janna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b1bfa8047d2ab5bd1ffe40","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5325578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Pierre Pillay","original_name":"Jean Pierre Pillay","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b1bfbd5c311d82203cc4d1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5657689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marienne Louise","original_name":"Marienne Louise","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b1bfc8959f5bcca8b4e7e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5657696,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ngiam Teo","original_name":"Ngiam Teo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b1bfefb9cd20f8af9e1145","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5657690,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Muhammad Raihan Bin Mohammed Rasul","original_name":"Muhammad Raihan Bin Mohammed Rasul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b1c005df709254b09e112d","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5657689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marienne Louise","original_name":"Marienne Louise","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b1c22939a2115ab81f180b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eem3pEVpmGns52p8VpryA5OzEAE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/suHG5kQ41S0amWTOp0QQnMb9xAt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xAfnai81yVTwWwiY0MctWeyQIlB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qhdMnyW4JhNHWQgik2F69o50TEf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eHvzGu125aaK0BzcgPWD3VgZNG2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/myiMSURNVTar5MszaLhuF6r1He6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"tl","file_path":"/5YOQJ9VivKh8vOKht65ADfAW7Mt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":319683,"name":"overseas filipino workers"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bahay-Bahayan (echoes beyond the horizon) - Trailer","key":"ef3kNpOxGso","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-08-23T05:27:00.000Z","id":"68b1c2dd71140ab30954d7c2"}]}}}
