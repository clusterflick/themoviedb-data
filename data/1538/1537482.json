A present of robbed freedoms, properties exploited and forgotten by those who hold the key to the globalisation of toture and repression. A bid, at the end of division, to grant the Right to a Future in the Present, from the West and democratic action in the name of the Sahara.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"25 minutes of Sahara","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5655885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pili Ramírez","original_name":"Pili Ramírez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b08b45415c66b5895ed7c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":298721,"name":"women"},{"id":356810,"name":"sahrawi refugee camps"},{"id":356811,"name":"occupied territories"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
