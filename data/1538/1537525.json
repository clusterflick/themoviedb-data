Set within the walls of a quiet house, the film drifts through empty spaces where days blur into nights. His routines echo through kitchens, hallways, and living rooms, revealing both resilience and despair. Is he waiting for a person, a sign, or simply for life itself to change? With minimal dialogue and a haunting atmosphere, the film captures the weight of anticipation and the silence of being forgotten.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/s7rwFiJbG7vgXFaJZ9nJL165xM2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"No One Ever Comes","title":"No One Ever Comes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5656022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Dotterer","original_name":"David Dotterer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Man","credit_id":"68b0a26e8f6680ad2b79c3c8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4803898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Lee Sanders","original_name":"Jay Lee Sanders","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gf66FOKo9iYNnwUsfwCBcBxvOP6.jpg","credit_id":"68b0a1ec20a03a84480f916d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4803899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elisa Broche","original_name":"Elisa Broche","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/xZpEfFuO9WaxJjedfk0WfxubJd.jpg","credit_id":"68b0a20a64cec581ab5ed6cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4803899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elisa Broche","original_name":"Elisa Broche","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/xZpEfFuO9WaxJjedfk0WfxubJd.jpg","credit_id":"68b0a21d2c5f1c61ddf39185","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5656025,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sydney Field","original_name":"Sydney Field","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/yybvDsVXe0E1HwBY7HyNEq0aAbL.jpg","credit_id":"68b0a2f9bd1687cc9a5ed7e9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5656445,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ruth Eddy","original_name":"Ruth Eddy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0f1043c5c901a1e156e14","department":"Writing","job":"Script Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5656446,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jack Axelrod","original_name":"Jack Axelrod","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b0f119d2c74fd7e11ffa19","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.757,"height":2283,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s7rwFiJbG7vgXFaJZ9nJL165xM2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
