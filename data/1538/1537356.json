He always uses this key to lock something very valuable to him in his bank deposit box. Fate is unpredictable, so the jeweler dies and his son Sasha ends up in prison. Thanks to Sashko's easygoing nature, his two friends in misfortune, Stas and Bonia, get their hands on 100 kilograms of gold. So when Sashko is released from prison, instead of looking for his father's killer and the key that was stolen from him, he has to deal with his debt problems. However, this becomes increasingly unrealistic: the mayor and a couple of strange criminal groups join the race for the key and the gold. Possession of the key to success does not necessarily mean success itself.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/fhYt9oR3SoQvsb4i8D9xsl9qels.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Downtown, or The Key to Success","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Даунтаун, или Ключ к успеху","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5655562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serhii Hoholev","original_name":"Serhii Hoholev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b058a2f91f1133db79c22e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3189680,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oleksii Komarovskyi","original_name":"Олексій Комаровський","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/bcP3cbGHCr6MY0RTYLSDpbDARzw.jpg","credit_id":"68b058c00c5ed11afaf399c7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4545010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexey Bychkov","original_name":"Alexey Bychkov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b058f33e7b764b30b375d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5655563,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrii Zuz","original_name":"Andrii Zuz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b05909a6ce6d074db37ba3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/fhYt9oR3SoQvsb4i8D9xsl9qels.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
