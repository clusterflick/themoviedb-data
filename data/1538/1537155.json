After a close call with her sleazy new boyfriend, Jae-in (Jung Yi Ju) discovers a prominent soap company is offering a service to clean up more than just your average mess. Discreet, corporate-minded, and methodical, the outfit in question does a good job, allowing Jae-in to go back to her life as an aspiring actress. She’s haunted by lingering paranoia, however, and soon she remembers a loose end that needs attending to…  Lee is not one to waste time, and every second of his two-hour film counts. Opening with a warped take on TV commercials, the plot that follows is streamlined and suspenseful. The send-ups of corporate culture and the world of screen acting are darkly amusing, and visually Savon is a treat — sleek, polished, and finely composed. Lee has the smarts of a good satirist and the instincts of a born entertainer.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Savon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Jun-sup","original_name":"Lee Jun-sup","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68afd96ebb7e4a9532b375fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vancouver International Film Festival ","release_date":"2025-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
