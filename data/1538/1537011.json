Set in the heart of oil and gas country in a remote part of Alberta, Canada, the film explores the interconnectedness between an artist and his environment, and an ongoing battle against those who seek to destroy it for profit.  The film takes its name from von Tiesenhausen's artwork, Lifeline (1990â€“), a white picket fence, to which an eight-foot section is added each year. The piece now stretches over 280 feet long and is an enduring symbol of resistance, the passage of time, and a life lived.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fTHGr2ChU6HR0XCADWGaTn3UdCy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lifeline","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5147476,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Morgan Pinnock","original_name":"Morgan Pinnock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68af87b014a92b1f7c624d46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":831,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fTHGr2ChU6HR0XCADWGaTn3UdCy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
