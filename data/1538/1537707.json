The coldest place on our planet is also one of the most affected by global warming and needs to be protected. The expedition focuses on exploring, documenting, and surfing in the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula, in the area known as Domain 1, which is being pushed for Marine Protected Area (MPA) status. Protected areas are very important for mitigating climate change and, in this case, also for regulating human activities such as concentrated fishing. This film helps us understand the importance of this area and the threats affecting it.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96311,"logo_path":"/q5ZACDAKMLJZSZ7uKtTQPRf98tO.png","name":"Gauchos del Mar","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":242132,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Small Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2025-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antarctica - Domain One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joaquín Azulay","original_name":"Joaquín Azulay","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6ikVuNB6xhVm7dM8agPSP8CDAfe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68b12317047d2ab5bd1ffb3a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Azulay","original_name":"Julian Azulay","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/pz99izieeehCFsnpGGJRABgLy4h.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68b1232e6d23cee639396da5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Darín","original_name":"Ricardo Darín","popularity":0.4702,"profile_path":"/wP7gyISMcsXLJoInWTjncqhrsAT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrador","credit_id":"68b12349ecc72f689d3cc1ef","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Azulay","original_name":"Julian Azulay","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/pz99izieeehCFsnpGGJRABgLy4h.jpg","credit_id":"68b12376a6946dba5054d4e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joaquín Azulay","original_name":"Joaquín Azulay","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6ikVuNB6xhVm7dM8agPSP8CDAfe.jpg","credit_id":"68b1238ed69a48767254d515","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5007511,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matteo meglioli","original_name":"Matteo meglioli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b123f78b1ad284493cc1bb","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5007513,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Giorgio Galizia","original_name":"Giorgio Galizia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b12417e81e007fb2510c88","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5656712,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Massimiliano Verdesca","original_name":"Massimiliano Verdesca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b12442676f120bd9510d8d","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joaquín Azulay","original_name":"Joaquín Azulay","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6ikVuNB6xhVm7dM8agPSP8CDAfe.jpg","credit_id":"68b1247c196fde9d0f156e73","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3937233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Fió","original_name":"Diego Fió","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b124a0970365fcb41f1504","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33560012","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
