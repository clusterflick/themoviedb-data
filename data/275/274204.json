Displaying the uniquely heroic quality of his voice, Domingo heads a superb cast, including Sara Mingardo, Monica Bacelli, and Ingela Bohlin, all magnificently responsive to Paul McCreesh's authentic and luminous musical interpretation of the score. The stunning theatrical staging by Graham Vick provides a splendid setting for the characters and for designer Richard Hudson's extravagant Baroque-Islamic costumes, emphasizing the brilliance of one of Handel's finest dramatic achievements. -  Monica Bacelli, Plácido Domingo, Ingela Bohlin","popularity":0.1487,"poster_path":"/6bjOqJs20m4SO0XjILgeS8kR3TC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro Real de Madrid","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2008-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":242,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handel: Tamerlano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Plácido Domingo","original_name":"Plácido Domingo","popularity":0.342,"profile_path":"/r0OUJ630b7dllOFBQ4SElP3XnpC.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Bajazet","credit_id":"5a43cde59251417403042f9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica Bacelli","original_name":"Monica Bacelli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tamerlano","credit_id":"5a43cdf69251411f3e06629b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1949000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingela Bohlin","original_name":"Ingela Bohlin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Asteria","credit_id":"5a43ce069251411fd50691a4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Mingardo","original_name":"Sara Mingardo","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/nDMq9lElFy5qj3PcOaYU2BPQcUv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Andronico","credit_id":"5a43ce189251417403042fe3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4687411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Holloway","original_name":"Jennifer Holloway","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/vvAGJSXCTcPSNzecf4X3mNNdDSB.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Irene","credit_id":"66327a6c41465c012acaa09b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luigi De Donato","original_name":"Luigi De Donato","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Leone","credit_id":"5a43ce380e0a264fb90537eb","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Graham Vick","original_name":"Graham Vick","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a43ce4c0e0a264f290518bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1949001,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul McCreesh","original_name":"Paul McCreesh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a43ce8b0e0a264f77050bfb","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ángel Luis Ramírez","original_name":"Ángel Luis Ramírez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a43ce6a9251411fab06be9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georg Friedrich Händel","original_name":"Georg Friedrich Händel","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/7vbMm0VcHE0vTlaU9BTLqILenM0.jpg","credit_id":"5a43ce7b925141361f0194cf","department":"Crew","job":"Compositors"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2236394","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g9VMHqlFtTAGX3oETdRIqB0auEV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6bjOqJs20m4SO0XjILgeS8kR3TC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
