Filmed with fluid camera movements and a sensuous attention to lighting-camera work, Julien makes of the museum a world of shadows, mirrors and frames-within-frames where the statues also dream and the vagabond spirit of colonialism's repressed memory comes dancing, jerkily, back to life. Choreography by Javier De Frutos.  7', two-screen installation, 16mm film transferred to digital, colour, sound.","popularity":0.0799,"poster_path":"/su2PI6JFYd3SdfK5LVr1gXoaZ7z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vagabondia","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaac Julien","original_name":"Isaac Julien","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/3I1Su7TgaUYy1tecYUHDqTrzR2F.jpg","credit_id":"53941bd4c3a36842520009fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1509,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/su2PI6JFYd3SdfK5LVr1gXoaZ7z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1006}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
