The first one, French, focuses on the King's Square (a space where everything is arranged in order to be seen). The other one, English, is the exact opposite, because from any point within it, one falls out of view. Within these two constructions, the labyrinth and the concentric circles, Ruiz conceives a 'photo-roman' plot: a husband and his mistress rendez-vous in the English garden (one understands why) and, through a series of accidents and afraid of being seen, he relocates to the other garden.","popularity":0.0712,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Querelle de jardins","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Ruiz","original_name":"Raúl Ruiz","popularity":0.2407,"profile_path":"/gsJkcICbmk1GCi3EkDkxE6qZcpe.jpg","credit_id":"53908defc3a3680d66001a46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0084566","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
