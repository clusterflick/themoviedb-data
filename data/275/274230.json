Gaines, author of \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,\" comes a deceptively simple, yet emotionally complex tale of a young boy's discovery of what it's like to be black in Louisiana during the 1940's. James, the boy in question, has a raging toothache that necessitates a trip to the dentist. His mother (played by Emmy-winner Olivia Cole), accompanies James to town on an eye-opening odyssey where the boy gains valuable insights into poverty, racism - and his own sense of pride. With an exciting musical score by Webster Lewis, this multi-award winning film explores a child's discovery that the world is a complicated place... where things are never truly black or white... only shades of gray.","popularity":1.6478,"poster_path":"/wM9AuRNXvLLxt7uUOHJ8AlEx6fj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Learning in
