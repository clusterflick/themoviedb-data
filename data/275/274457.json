An independent memoir written, directed and produced by an American who worked in Ma's company for eight years, Crocodile in the Yangtze captures the emotional ups and downs of life in a Chinese Internet startup at a time when the Internet brought China face-to-face with the West.  Crocodile in the Yangtze draws on 200 hours of archival footage filmed by over 35 sources between 1995 and 2009. The film presents a strikingly candid portrait of Ma and his company, told from the point of view of an “American fly on a Chinese wall” who witnessed the successes and the mistakes Alibaba encountered as it grew from a small apartment into a global company employing 16,000 staff.","popularity":0.7711,"poster_path":"/u04HlKlRP7abRRUCFUVCzYxo0U3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taluswood Films","origin_country":""},{"id":24573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Purple Reel Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crocodile in the Yangtze","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1923698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Ma","original_name":"Jack Ma","popularity":0.3751,"profile_path":"/5DhVpQEcXeSiIYjwVLC1bj8WHVT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jack Ma","credit_id":"5d7b512b069f0e62d73359da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Porter Erisman","original_name":"Porter Erisman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/26NIbtn5A9HdZEiA9Ln4xWFnQOx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62e396be68b766005864ef19","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Porter Erisman","original_name":"Porter Erisman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/26NIbtn5A9HdZEiA9Ln4xWFnQOx.jpg","credit_id":"62e3af0af0647c007ad69236","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Porter Erisman","original_name":"Porter Erisman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/26NIbtn5A9HdZEiA9Ln4xWFnQOx.jpg","credit_id":"5d7b517f33ec2600147fa4cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2057956","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"CrocodileInTheYangtze","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u04HlKlRP7abRRUCFUVCzYxo0U3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":478,"name":"china"},{"id":12094,"name":"business"},{"id":159983,"name":"entrepreneurship"},{"id":171068,"name":"entrepreneur"},{"id":185507,"name":"startup"},{"id":210679,"name":"alibaba"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Crocodile in the Yangtze - Trailer","key":"FHlT3QxMqCs","published_at":"2012-08-20T07:06:05.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5391b5e80e0a260fc20017fb"}]}}}
