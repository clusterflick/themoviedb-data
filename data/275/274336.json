The children's mother died a few weeks earlier. Before she died she asked her children to find their birth father who left them when they were still babies. Their quest in search of their father leads them to hospitals, nursing homes and holding cells. In the course of the quest the brother and sister meet people who provide them - like in parallel quantum universes - a glance into what their future lives may hold for them.","popularity":0.9062,"poster_path":"/eQ5p3FrZ2LCoUxq7N8K9CAaxQBb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rabinovich Film Fund Cinema Project","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2012-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urban Tale","video":false,"vote_average":4.444,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Maasiya Urbanit","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Urban.Tale","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"מעשיה אורבנית","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ohad Knoller","original_name":"Ohad Knoller","popularity":0.4503,"profile_path":"/h5g16mN4MeVSZOAYx4chWDUDuYL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Man in jail cell","credit_id":"5390f1fac3a368645c00014d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eli Gorenstein","original_name":"Eli Gorenstein","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":"/y6TKeCHXSn8XjcmdTabSDmXL8vK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5390f20bc3a368647200014f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avi Grainik","original_name":"Avi Grainik","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":"/iBN8M1ei7OfGHcH3RSP3naWVuh9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Receptionist","credit_id":"5390f210c3a3686488000141","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ami Weinberg","original_name":"Ami Weinberg","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":"/mr45bCTcmyWMfpxcioi8EGhnAwG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lawyer","credit_id":"5390f229c3a368646a00017b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2885710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noa Fridman","original_name":"Noa Fridman","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":"/qpqLITMe3Efne53Ip1lMjC845cu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Karima / Sister","credit_id":"638aa28ae93e9501e208dad2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1449875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esti Yerushalmi","original_name":"Esti Yerushalmi","popularity":0.2932,"profile_path":"/ah3XvEkY9AdxRYbBKr2Q7g1ITvc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Teacher","credit_id":"638aa29a7d5db500c89ba066","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1672770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noa Koler","original_name":"Noa Koler","popularity":0.2479,"profile_path":"/kZPhbHaIK5wv6SjUO7DTRd23sQn.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Phone operator","credit_id":"638aa2f3c3aa3f0096e1aeba","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1977312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zohar Wagner","original_name":"Zohar Wagner","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/ua7KJXqejpA0RxnIXfvhBQC6FSF.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self / Singer","credit_id":"638aa4050e64af009e8ec791","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliav Lilti","original_name":"Eliav Lilti","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5390f193c3a3686479000137","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliav Lilti","original_name":"Eliav Lilti","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5390f1a1c3a3686472000149","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2734854","wikidata_id":"Q12409391","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/eQ5p3FrZ2LCoUxq7N8K9CAaxQBb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/4Xk24yMHPcYxFpQMYF2xxEpxFfy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1278,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/n70NmjE2Mf38YKNSsjY4pr2vBhD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":852}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Urban Tale -  English Trailer","key":"iWVbhuUBk1c","published_at":"2013-02-21T10:12:43.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5390f303c3a368648800015c"}]}}}
