In Three Cheers for Catherine the Great! from author Cari Best, Sara's feisty Russian grandmother asks for \"no presents\" for her birthday—and gets them— one from each neighbor and one from Mama. Can Sara come up with the perfect \"no present\" in time for the party?  Told from a small girl's point of view, Five Creatures from author Emily Jenkins is the charming story of the two cats and three humans that live in her house.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Love You Like Crazy Cakes ... and More Stories About Families","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
