What If... had gone gold in Japan and the band lined up 11 Japanese dates in support of the release. At the end of January 2011, during a weeklong promotional trip to promote the album and tour, they were invited to the WOWOW TV Studios in Tokyo to perform a special acoustic show. When the talk of a broadcast first came up, Mr. Big wanted to present something different than they've ever done before, thus the idea of an acoustic show came about and a string quintet was brought in to enhance the project even more. The result from that magic night in Tokyo is now here: 10 Mr. Big classics in a completely new and fresh setting and a unique portrait of the band during their very first acoustic show.","popularity":0.0821,"poster_path":"/4QEVJonRR9byiB8uWspuIfn3jHj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frontiers Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mr. Big","title":"Mr. Big Live From The Living Room","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Martin","original_name":"Eric Martin","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/k9WbKK1hS44iXVTLbCaG8ufkAsO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"5391dbae0e0a260fc5001c14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Brandon Gilbert","original_name":"Paul Brandon Gilbert","popularity":0.1298,"profile_path":"/s7qD2aysjCMFVMn1A4oQKupjGjO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"5391dc0d0e0a260fbc001c27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Sheehan","original_name":"Billy Sheehan","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/PUkVL63l5bbyffBrFEqlta2wFY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"5391dc240e0a260fb9001e06","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Torpey","original_name":"Pat Torpey","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/jGfMUAZ4Alttt5Ml3wTV6FOTGlz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Drums/Percussion","credit_id":"5391dc3e0e0a260fae001d36","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4QEVJonRR9byiB8uWspuIfn3jHj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
