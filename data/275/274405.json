Set within an isolated desert landscape contrasted with recognizable scenes of the intensity of family life, this vanguard work demonstrates the richness and variety of the black experience; it is a poetic and hard-hitting commentary on the complexities of race, gender and sexuality.","popularity":1.1383,"poster_path":"/35tIrNcXRNFpsOtX04WEJsumrRa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16228,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sankofa Film &
