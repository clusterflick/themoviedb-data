He only produced around 35 works of art, yet they made him immortal. He was born in Delft and never left the town; he married there, worked as an art-dealer and died in debt. Michael Gill delves into the master's world and talks about the camera obscura and Vermeer's interest in science and cartography. Together with experts, he explores Vermeer's secrets of perspective, space, allegory and symbolic relationships in his works.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/jC7j9BT2VyPJrG9Y9i1p5A1y9k5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19492,"logo_path":null,"name":"ArtHaus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jan Vermeer: Light Love and Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Art Lives Series:  Vermeer:  Light, Love, and Silence","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2056230,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dave Jacobs","original_name":"Dave Jacobs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d37f15aab68490012891805","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0488468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jC7j9BT2VyPJrG9Y9i1p5A1y9k5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
