Specially commissioned aerial photography gazes down at the landscape, from Nazareth to Jerusalem, pausing at various points to talk to the local people who protect and care for Jesus' legacy. From Cana, where Jesus turned water into wine, to Mount of the Beatitudes, where he delivered the famous sermon, to Bethsaida where the miracle of the loaves and fishes was performed. Shot on location in the Holy Land in High Definition format, the stunning locations jump out from the screen, bringing the bible to life in vivid colour and providing a stunning back drop to 'greatest story ever told'.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flight of Faith: The Jesus Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
