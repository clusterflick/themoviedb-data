Memories of how he got the part, what it was like to make the series and the reaction from fans are all recalled by Parker. This is a low-key documentary, but a very nice inclusion for the set.  Next we find A Conversation With Fess Parker. For this 17-minute and five-second piece, Maltin visits the actor at his vineyard and restaurant, and the two reminisce about the series. We learn factoids that relate to the production, Parker’s casting, his memories of the actors and Walt, and a mix of other elements in this decent little interview. In addition to the shots of Maltin and Parker, we see some behind the scenes footage as well as stills and clips from the series. Note that though the DVD’s case lists interview pieces with Buddy Ebsen, these don’t appear.","popularity":0.1937,"poster_path":"/pEpFUk60ZIeWXb4bn7hXJ09oqnC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Conversation with Fess Parker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard Maltin","original_name":"Leonard Maltin","popularity":0.1889,"profile_path":"/5jQo1L8Vv10nZQQeMgSaCjLxJlB.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Host","credit_id":"539359e0c3a368642b001a3e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fess Parker","original_name":"Fess Parker","popularity":0.4318,"profile_path":"/z72Gh4aWood5nFj3S1iO3sTvAdR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"539359eec3a368643c001a69","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0407685","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xhf7DLZK5waRUSUeLeBxwhlZhCs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pEpFUk60ZIeWXb4bn7hXJ09oqnC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
