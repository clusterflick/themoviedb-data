When she arrives she finds that all the residents, other than a small, tightly knit group of Elijah's friends have left for winter. When Elijah doesn't materialize at his own party, his guests carry on in his honor, having a bacchanalian night fueled with booze and psychedelics, playing games and telling stories of their absent friend. As a storm threatens their night of fun, Molly experiences a surreal evening of emotional and sexual exploration she won't soon forget.","popularity":0.1255,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Molly Takes a Trip","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Gasp","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1328421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Gulner","original_name":"Angela Gulner","popularity":0.1504,"profile_path":"/kHz9XQtwWvS9aBMBNdg3l5gi4mD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hannah","credit_id":"539319660e0a266dc20021ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1328422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geri-Nikole Love","original_name":"Geri-Nikole Love","popularity":0.0826,"profile_path":"/myblT2h4w3Wpri96S8ET1LrO23a.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Claire","credit_id":"5393197e0e0a266dca002147","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Mann","original_name":"Jake Mann","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Turk","credit_id":"539319930e0a266dbb0022b0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa Carette","original_name":"Elsa Carette","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Molly","credit_id":"539319a70e0a266db40021b6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Urbina","original_name":"Ken Urbina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"539319ba0e0a266dce00221d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Wilson","original_name":"Charlie Wilson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Wyatt","credit_id":"539319d00e0a266db40021bf","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328418,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annika Kurnick","original_name":"Annika Kurnick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"539318df0e0a266dc20021df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328420,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Russell Cramer","original_name":"Russell Cramer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"539319200e0a266dce002210","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328418,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annika Kurnick","original_name":"Annika Kurnick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551da1abc3a3683a0d000c8d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31579,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heather McIntosh","original_name":"Heather McIntosh","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/kUT5Gtq0bPtoarB9f90KBbLG5bg.jpg","credit_id":"5a43db6f0e0a264f77051d99","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3377988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
