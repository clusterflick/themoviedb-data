Ross Bennett is a stand-up comic for people who say they don't like Stand-up comics. Bright, insightful and classically funny. Ross's point of view is what he calls â€˜NEW YORK COUNTRY'. He's a guy who grew up in a small town in western New York State, with traditional American values and sensibilities. But his years of living in \"The Big City\" have made his act accessible to everyone.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/KTlNM0ll1j40YDasFYg96EWNyr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ross Bennett: Live in Toomler, Amsterdam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Bennett","original_name":"Ross Bennett","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Ross Bennett","credit_id":"53943c8dc3a3686415002914","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/KTlNM0ll1j40YDasFYg96EWNyr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
