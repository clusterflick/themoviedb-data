Originally performed in the late 1970s as a live recital with monitors, \"Violin Power\" began with the idea of generating a video image solely through the sound and movement of the bow. This signal switch, from audio to visual, grew in possibilities and variances as technology continued to expand in the ensuing decades. The most recent iteration of this performance involved Steina working with a MIDI violin and laptop.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/cd0tlOUw7KqwFF4U9QnilIbnFjr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Violin Power","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steina Vasulka","original_name":"Steina Vasulka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fc15693ac8e6b003d357904","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steina Vasulka","original_name":"Steina Vasulka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5390e43bc3a368646a000065","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cd0tlOUw7KqwFF4U9QnilIbnFjr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pAO8Miw8CWDf7I0uLynjJJpWKA8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"National Gallery of Art: Machine Vision: Monitors and Space by Steina","release_date":"2020-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
