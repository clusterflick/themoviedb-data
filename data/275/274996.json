She has dedicated her life to saving the Asian elephant and founded a special camp, The Elephant Nature Park to protect them. We follow this winner of Time Magazine’s “Asian Hero of the Year” Award in her work.  Lek is on a mission to save the Asian elephant in her native Thailand. This film looks at the plight of the Asian elephant, as it goes from being a widely used domestic animal, to becoming a burden on modernizing communities. With experts predicting its extinction within four decades, Lek’s work is needed now more than ever and she has gathered a large group of supporters and volunteers in her quest for a better future for the Asian elephant.  This moving film demonstrates Lek’s natural understanding of and rapport with these huge animals and will stir the viewers emotions as it highlights the often desperate state some elephants are kept in.","popularity":0.2899,"poster_path":"/dNNXd5NuASktxkd85obhUkJuin4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22227,"logo_path":null,"name":"Profilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2012-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elephant Whisperer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328785,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Dís Ólafsdóttir","original_name":"Anna Dís Ólafsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62860fe59ca75933653c2e95","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328783,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Johann Sigfússon","original_name":"Johann Sigfússon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62860e939ca7593366ff4d41","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328783,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Johann Sigfússon","original_name":"Johann Sigfússon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62860e70f10a1a009db2e97f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328783,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Johann Sigfússon","original_name":"Johann Sigfússon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53946d6cc3a3686415002c22","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328785,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Dís Ólafsdóttir","original_name":"Anna Dís Ólafsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53946d81c3a368642b002dc2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328783,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Johann Sigfússon","original_name":"Johann Sigfússon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53946d4fc3a3684252000f58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hinrik Ólafsson","original_name":"Hinrik Ólafsson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/ncJFVsADCxDNfGqpSlfNEEjVgvK.jpg","credit_id":"53946d94c3a3684252000f60","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2799064","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dNNXd5NuASktxkd85obhUkJuin4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10084,"name":"rescue"},{"id":2857,"name":"elephant"},{"id":3434,"name":"thailand"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Elephant Whisperer - Wildscreen Festival Nominee 2012","key":"dRs9wXYZO0w","published_at":"2012-06-25T12:23:06.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"53946a3cc3a3686434002d92"}]}}}
