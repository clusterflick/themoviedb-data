The film follows the lives of a few individuals over the course of an entire year.  They are part of a network support group of Hollywood hopefuls and established professionals who call themselves The Table because their informal meetings occur in the backrooms of Los Angeles restaurants - most frequently at Patyâ€™s in Toluca Lake, CA.  The Table is where doers and dreamers alike come to share their stories, strategies, and aspirations.  Remarkably, they have been meeting together in this way every Thursday for nearly 20 years!","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Table","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1740702","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
