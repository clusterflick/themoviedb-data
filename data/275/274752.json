Between 1996 and 2006, despite warnings of an impending food shortage, prices for farm goods dropped to their lowest point in Canadian history, driving many farmers off the land. With a family history of farming spanning generations, the Sudermans now face a challenge that threatens to pull the family apart. As Steve Suderman films his family, the fight for economic survival becomes a poignant story of hope, determination, and the search for purpose.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"a farm story, inside out.","title":"Over Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Suderman","original_name":"Steven Suderman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53924adfc3a368643400061e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1357188","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
