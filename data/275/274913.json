The world they occupy is not a world of large events but the rituals of everyday life, traditions and interdependence. “In Spring One Plants Alone” documents the minutiae of their very enclosed existence. Filmed over a period of one and a half years, it emerges as a rare, haunting and powerful portrayal of their life together. This is the story of their rituals and of their survival. The small and disconnected instances that we encounter form a lone vision of the rifts and the bond between an old woman and her disturbed son.","popularity":0.1049,"poster_path":"/haW4ZcgwkSY7l6zn6PC75bapYFO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vincent Ward Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1980-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Spring One Plants Alone","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Ward","original_name":"Vincent Ward","popularity":0.1532,"profile_path":"/wB7WbhfrcJQl1nc0AbCjJ26d1eE.jpg","credit_id":"53938b3d0e0a266dca002a1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044350,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jack Body","original_name":"Jack Body","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd32ce0e0a266efe001575","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15290,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Leon Narbey","original_name":"Leon Narbey","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd32e40e0a266f14001a50","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":15090,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alun Bollinger","original_name":"Alun Bollinger","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd32d9c3a36841b6001e78","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427955,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christopher Lancaster","original_name":"Christopher Lancaster","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afd32f20e0a266f1a001613","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2658798","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1441,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/haW4ZcgwkSY7l6zn6PC75bapYFO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":961}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
