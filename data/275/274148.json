Spilling patches of colors are arranged in the form of cowboys and horses, creating a surprising and brilliant parody of the western. Animation is also an intriguing self-comment: the viewer watches not only the struggle between good and evil, but also the process of creating a film world. Made in 1960, the award-winning Little Western is the first fully auteur movie in the history of Polish animation - the director and screenwriter in one person also took care of the visual development of the film.","popularity":0.0988,"poster_path":"/9DS7CGlNabT1iVOvFslVkCW9Z1i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Miniatur Filmowych","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1961-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Little Western","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158337,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Witold Giersz","original_name":"Witold Giersz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bccdf7d7fbda005856ac14","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80171,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jerzy Matuszkiewicz","original_name":"Jerzy Matuszkiewicz","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/x6mqGeaSQ1TLyTkjeYCxaCcgfFz.jpg","credit_id":"60bcce110bc5290029e361fc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2601167,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aleksander Lipowski","original_name":"Aleksander Lipowski","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bcce37d7fbda0040af7cc0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158337,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Witold Giersz","original_name":"Witold Giersz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"539068b2c3a3680d5e0017a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0440609","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/9DS7CGlNabT1iVOvFslVkCW9Z1i.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/nVUSdcKuQr2M7DDa7jMsQX2DXd6.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Blu-ray - Essential Polish Animation","release_date":"2025-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
