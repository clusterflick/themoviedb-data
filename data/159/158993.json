The film highlights why people from diverse age, ethnic and financial backgrounds support the movement and its focus of removing money from politics in order to reclaim democracy from entrenched corporate interests so that critical issues including job creation, affordable access to health and education, protecting the environment and gun safety can be fully addressed. Featuring interviews with a wide range of subjects including Occupiers, economist Jeffrey Sachs and business magnate Russell Simmons.","popularity":0.5684,"poster_path":"/mhuB89emXmRwPMPBk9NWCayvAH3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"99%: The Occupy Wall Street Collaborative Film","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"99% - The Occupy Wall Street Collaborative Film","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"99 Percent: The Occupy Wall Street Collaborative Film","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":204492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Taibbi","original_name":"Matt Taibbi","popularity":0.2176,"profile_path":"/wLq49eqCKNH9e6kYhEupn5ZjA28.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4bff9251416c910ec46f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1105848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naomi Wolf","original_name":"Naomi Wolf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cI4gcdBnd9e9Q2HgVYSays7vU3Y.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4bff9251416c910ec473","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boots Riley","original_name":"Boots Riley","popularity":0.1901,"profile_path":"/gOVD3zUjeHNEqxWrKMz8W3ZKHmb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4bff9251416c910ec477","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nina Krstic","original_name":"Nina Krstic","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/dwjF47jJoAyCdz8UkwYtvj4ok8H.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bff9251416c910ec46b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146545,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Aites","original_name":"Aaron Aites","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bff9251416c910ec45f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Audrey Ewell","original_name":"Audrey Ewell","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bff9251416c910ec459","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1140435,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucian Read","original_name":"Lucian Read","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bff9251416c910ec465","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":929825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ava DuVernay","original_name":"Ava DuVernay","popularity":0.5427,"profile_path":"/84rc8I3Wf5zkCWGMNeTtmRekHW0.jpg","credit_id":"582c5ba192514111c0007d28","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2201488","wikidata_id":"Q16248270","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9gL8NaXDORUvuEn7HOOVgI5sFp0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mhuB89emXmRwPMPBk9NWCayvAH3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1382}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"99% - The Occupy Wall Street Collaborative Film","key":"JpjcJDpwG_U","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-08-16T23:38:00.000Z","id":"6430b3bf1b729400f1e200c6"}]}}}
