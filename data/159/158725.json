When their ship departs, they unpack only to find a young stowaway, who romanticized Arctic heroes, and tried to join them on multiple occasions finally succeeding. That's how six became seven.  Life of polar explorers is tough, and full of danger. During one year they are largely isolated from the mainland, and should survive using their resourcefulness, smarts, knowledge, and existing supplies with occasional unreliable radio communications. The Seven are resilient, cheerful, they forged a true friendship. Now they are ready to face the unforgiving Arctic.","popularity":0.8121,"poster_path":"/rtPwiAicRk3kH1qnrF1sI9wGKUM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10845,"logo_path":"/8qh5BEyKYOQ0e81LPbvWHQvyOy5.png","name":"Lenfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1936-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dedicated to the X congress of VLKSM (Soviet Communist Youth Union).","title":"The Brave Seven","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Seven Brave Men","type":"translated"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolai Bogolyubov","original_name":"Николай Боголюбов","popularity":0.1076,"profile_path":"/A2Er4ZVona4gLDn56WG790SiZle.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Iliya Letnikov, expedition leader","credit_id":"5394d1c2c3a368641500324c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Makarova","original_name":"Тамара Макарова","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/AqpreLHjJBpNqhalBH65nUgpO6A.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Zhenya Okhrimenko, medic","credit_id":"5394d2180e0a266dc2004daf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Novoseltsev","original_name":"Ivan Novoseltsev","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":"/cOSXrwxPtxhOYjLCnxsE6grrhgZ.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Bogun, pilot","credit_id":"5394d2370e0a266dbb00500e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleg Zhakov","original_name":"Олег Жаков","popularity":0.148,"profile_path":"/dyYhoYkg8Dsz0vPQfYcbihac1O2.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Kurt Schefer, radio operator","credit_id":"5394d2850e0a266db7004ea4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Apsolon","original_name":"Андрей Апсолон","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/lyPR6lSLOhOTgg3Q3WRx570mLU9.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Osya Korfunkel, meteorologist","credit_id":"5394d2ba0e0a266dbb005022","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Kuznetsov","original_name":"Иван Кузнецов","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":"/qubTizQYsN5OCxoIflBJwhIkuQ.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Sasha Rybnikov, mechanic","credit_id":"5394d3010e0a266db4004ea5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pyotr Aleynikov","original_name":"Пётр Алейников","popularity":0.1942,"profile_path":"/ikbCJOOQwR5WGPZUSURm5VtQNxC.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Moliboga, cook","credit_id":"5394d3440e0a266db7004ebe","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":624719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Gerasimov","original_name":"Сергей Герасимов","popularity":0.1956,"profile_path":"/gC2I7YQPAKBwNkHVWWIF4nQOH75.jpg","credit_id":"5394cd31c3a368642b0033aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328881,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Igor Chernyak","original_name":"Igor Chernyak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5394cd9ac3a368641d0033f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328883,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Evgeny Velichko","original_name":"Evgeny Velichko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5394cdf2c3a3684f45001406","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328884,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arnold Shargorodsky","original_name":"Arnold Shargorodsky","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5394ce29c3a3684f4500140d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328885,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"L.
