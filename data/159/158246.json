They invite a group of people (two minors, a woman, an elderly man and his younger companion who moves in a wheelchair) with the aim of putting into practice their most twisted fantasies, giving life to a nihilistic orgy with disconcerting results.","popularity":1.8516,"poster_path":"/khTYknUAzAv8QI4QGUNag2OQj5t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149902,"logo_path":null,"name":"Authentic Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"POETICAL, RADICAL, ORIGINAL, UNWIELDY...
