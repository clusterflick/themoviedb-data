He meets with the Executive Director, Anekta Kapoor, and after going through various formalities - including having his Kundali/Astrological Chart approved - he is hired and instructed to increase the firm's TRP's with a good day-time soap. With all ideas already being telecast by Ekta Kapoor and Balaji Telefilms, he is at a loss and encounters writers' block. This issue resolves itself after he meets with his neighbor, Sumana Roy Chowdhury, and decides to write a story about the two of them. His work is accepted, initial episodes are telecast, and the ratings do surge upwards - but not for long - as soon Sumana finds out, confronts him, the duo find they are attracted to each other and get married. The question remains: with the two getting married, how will the show and the remainder of the episodes proceed?","popularity":0.1007,"poster_path":"/sqSSJLBZOB6Po8DgpI0obUzipuD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idiot Box","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sushant Singh","original_name":"Sushant Singh","popularity":0.1972,"profile_path":"/cAXp9JphzW3E90OHhxyBB7JXyiO.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a53c1bf925141132c0385f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hrishitaa Bhatt","original_name":"Hrishitaa Bhatt","popularity":0.3065,"profile_path":"/4kV1o6U7OENwOSv9h4ujDijAGTw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a53c1c70e0a26026f03a5f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milind Gunaji","original_name":"Milind Gunaji","popularity":0.1822,"profile_path":"/8KJ8YEgbi7mb0YvZj8XVpDSB1Xq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a53c1d00e0a26026903a239","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Upasna Singh","original_name":"Upasna Singh","popularity":0.1664,"profile_path":"/1d22sfm4isBlg9q24YrcxxVDlFQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a53c1dac3a368751f03917d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1243976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Surendra Pal","original_name":"Surendra Pal","popularity":0.1416,"profile_path":"/TMvCp0D99PsgTwCJieM0VhLyTk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a53c1e29251411333035fe3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sunanda Mitra","original_name":"Sunanda Mitra","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a53c1fec3a368752703ae65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1612761","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tah6lvbHXFDqsVFXJDyaZ7EcDR3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sqSSJLBZOB6Po8DgpI0obUzipuD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
