When his act provokes a knuckle sandwich one night, the sensible, idealistic and much younger Thea (Janel Moloney) picks him up. Although the two have nothing in common, that doesn't stop them from falling in love. Romance is rough, however, when opposites attract in this thoughtful romantic comedy.","popularity":0.9538,"poster_path":"/yCkyqxTWSDwPAURZCnjEVHrl92C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Souler Opposite","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Meloni","original_name":"Christopher Meloni","popularity":1.6988,"profile_path":"/spEmmtupTNCJB1yeHcs3jov4Keg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Barry Singer","credit_id":"52fe4bfc9251416c910ebdd7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":80966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janel Moloney","original_name":"Janel Moloney","popularity":0.3943,"profile_path":"/buqdVJTYlomwaVxkTFev53DeV3D.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Thea Douglas","credit_id":"52fe4bfc9251416c910ebddb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Busfield","original_name":"Timothy Busfield","popularity":1.0283,"profile_path":"/r2VQ4Ar1WCISJoTqOOcO3HEgN4p.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Robert Levin","credit_id":"52fe4bfc9251416c910ebddf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":152638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Borkan","original_name":"Gene Borkan","popularity":0.1926,"profile_path":"/b4YJYoLnrq5dZzCWpeUcfTdI03q.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Father 'Actor'","credit_id":"5e4e23c09b8616001869ed28","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1481257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Neil","original_name":"Julian Neil","popularity":0.0438,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Reporter","credit_id":"656d6b014a4bf6010350e735","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":157119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Kalmenson","original_name":"Bill Kalmenson","popularity":0.1751,"profile_path":"/oxiwLtPqMle4wgNmgVvst7hXNVu.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bfc9251416c910ebdd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0120171","wikidata_id":"Q61665021","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lfYSPSUqB4i8KRg65WouyDepYNv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yCkyqxTWSDwPAURZCnjEVHrl92C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
