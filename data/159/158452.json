Then a dashing young man, Ranbir Oberoi, enters Tina's life and it is love at first sight for them. Nandini also approves of him, and it looks like Tina has given up on her dislike for Nandini. After a few days, and a purse-snatching incident, Nandini counsels Tina that she should consider breaking up with Ranbir.
