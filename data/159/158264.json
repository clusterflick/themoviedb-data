The music of Mozart has quite literally been an essential driving force of Daniel Barenboim’s entire life. It remains central to his performing career both as a pianist and as a conductor.  These illuminating performances of Mozart’s last eight great piano concertos admirably demonstrate Barenboim’s dictum that even when a true musician has already performed a familiar work hundreds of times, he or she ‘never accepts that the next note will be played the same way as it was played before.","popularity":0.0843,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":255,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barenboim plays Mozart","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Barenboim","original_name":"Daniel Barenboim","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":"/pNoHzRlu3vNQmQsB7XrmrFYjOd1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4be09251416c910e87b1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Moorse","original_name":"George Moorse","popularity":0.0986,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4be09251416c910e87bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaas Rusticus","original_name":"Klaas Rusticus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4be09251416c910e87c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Ponnelle","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Ponnelle","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":"/mbYg4fxvHOYD9YmDuzPp3JVuBri.jpg","credit_id":"53da670cc3a3681ed90019aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
