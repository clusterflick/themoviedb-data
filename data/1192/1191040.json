Yet the artist has remained as down-to-earth as his figures themselves. His wooden people fetch top prices at auctions at Christie's, Sothebie's and Co. Despite the trend towards abstraction, Balkenhol rediscovered the figurative for himself. The human being in itself, snatched from the hectic everyday world, reflecting, with an empty gaze. The sensation lies in the ordinary. Against the pathos of monuments and memorials. The film takes a look into the world of Stephan Balkenhol and observes him at work - the portrait of an extraordinary artist.","popularity":0.2084,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":12640,"logo_path":"/8ZrVPJZcLesWgHhZeNG98qzkq5u.png","name":"Filmkraft","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Bildhauer Stephan Balkenhol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Stephan Balkenhol, der außergewöhnliche Bildhauer","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Menschen tierisch! - Der Bildhauer Stephan Balkenhol","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4320077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephan Balkenhol","original_name":"Stephan Balkenhol","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/amDG0Z8RbfhEmH7sX0pu4Y783LT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"652a75eeea84c7014e04b916","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1309138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Heller","original_name":"Peter Heller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652a766b0cb33516f5c92c03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1309138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Heller","original_name":"Peter Heller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652a7646024ec800aecb24c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1971591,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Otmar Schmid","original_name":"Otmar Schmid","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652a7674024ec8011e33404e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832291,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ulrike Dotzer","original_name":"Ulrike Dotzer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652a80cd358da700ad34ac66","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4086898,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gregor Kuschel","original_name":"Gregor Kuschel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652a79841f3e6000e28fcaf4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":72146,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thomas Balkenhol","original_name":"Thomas Balkenhol","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652a7993024ec800aecb2658","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4320088,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Birger Engel","original_name":"Birger Engel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652a7968f2883802a327752e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3838078,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Klaus Lautenbacher","original_name":"Klaus Lautenbacher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652a796ff28838029f320b6f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263822,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Willke","original_name":"Thomas Willke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652a79a4358da700ad34a931","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4320123,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthias Winzen","original_name":"Matthias Winzen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652a80e5f2883802a25de751","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369274,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ulle Schröder","original_name":"Ulle Schröder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652a80d8f28838029ec543dc","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":173245,"name":"sculptor"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
