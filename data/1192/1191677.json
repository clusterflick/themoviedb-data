He is then seduced by Nona into murdering several innocent bystanders. Somewhere near Stephen King's fictional town of Castle Rock, Nona lures the narrator to a graveyard, and, when asking the repeated question 'Do you love?' leads him to madness. It is not immediately clear whether or not the narrator has encountered a supernatural force, or if Nona is a figment of insanity until the last unexpected twist.","popularity":0.2137,"poster_path":"/llAPylAUujSD7lzI1LxSMRiDbNP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":211008,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neon
