Forced labour, physical punishment and sexualised violence were the order of the day. To date, more than 150 former children have broken their silence, more than 80 perpetrators have been identified. Because the latter covered for each other and the neighbours looked away, the children were defenceless against the abuse for decades. When the scandal was exposed in 2013, the community and the village were hostile at first: That which must not be cannot be. It was only when the pressure from the outside grew that the community initiated a process of dealing with the scandal. But it is controversial: victims are re-traumatised, their statements doubted. To this day the children from Korntal are fighting for investigation and compensation.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/pHXznDM73ZFXr1fPFdADv0HV8Ee.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36620,"logo_path":"/1OYWV8ETCUgAJqqxd1rbfSP8IUN.png","name":"Bildersturm Filmproduktion GmbH","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children of Korntal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Charakter","original_name":"Julia Charakter","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652ae7ec358da700ad34d767","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Charakter","original_name":"Julia Charakter","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652ae7d81f3e6000ff85d13d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4320615,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Volker Ambruster","original_name":"Volker Ambruster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652ae84e358da701406c2e8b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Charakter","original_name":"Julia Charakter","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652ae8270cb33516f5c95983","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249412,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jonas Eckert","original_name":"Jonas Eckert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652ae819f2883802a25e109a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":419834,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Birgit Schulz","original_name":"Birgit Schulz","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652ae83f358da700ad34d77e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249412,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jonas Eckert","original_name":"Jonas Eckert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652ae8081f3e6000c5895415","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249413,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Mick Mahler","original_name":"Mick Mahler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652ae87ef2883802a327a19f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1068,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/onHRaBt3CHSXEBp9sctW2zGTC8x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1900},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1194,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/z9HqhLmJXzlT28NvRuYwFHHaTnp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2126},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1194,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/sizCLwbmPyXO2OVkxYvyxZmH7uN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2126},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1194,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/5T1Lse9FjjUsgElK7ce0k1X9ZNs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2126},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1194,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/rE65NMKiVw4R3iyFwwpIlG37nZA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2126},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1194,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/2XXsdgSjM62BQpve0TLfLAX0PQk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2126}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eIwGlBdpEm9vsgOqB5KXMZNurEC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":725},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9vh90G4S2NfbHuzss39znfIIPPA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":725},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/pHXznDM73ZFXr1fPFdADv0HV8Ee.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":636}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
