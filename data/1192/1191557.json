It is the realisation of his poetics in an open space and in the bodies of three performers and a pianist. It’s a hybrid object that fuses the language of theatre with that of television, and both of them with poetry, materialising themes that run throughout Eugénio de Andrade’s work, such as nature, desire, death and the craft of poetry itself.","popularity":0.0919,"poster_path":"/fNJXBOj8Kns6zjuTJAC61F5GF0j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2023-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Obscuro Domínio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1202280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Loubet","original_name":"André Loubet","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/l2j9Q1OdEgC2LxIxlcmCFIcyY2B.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"652b9c6d0cb33516fd49e8a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3116294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duarte Melo","original_name":"Duarte Melo","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/uYMs3zG504JqPZL7VI6OWom2fZ0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"652b9cabf28838029f329d78","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2678487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nuno Nolasco","original_name":"Nuno Nolasco","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/m1XKGKdlz4dwKUeFfPPC0v7Ne4u.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"652b9fd1024ec80101520677","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321198,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugénio de Andrade","original_name":"Eugénio de Andrade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652b9bf7024ec800e4451787","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321197,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Gorjão","original_name":"Daniel Gorjão","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652b9bc4f2883802a25e733f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Sousa","original_name":"João Sousa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652b9b7e024ec8011e33d397","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321204,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Máximo","original_name":"Máximo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652b9c5c358da7011dd87f95","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Sousa","original_name":"João Sousa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652b9b97f28838029f329cf5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321200,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Miguel Lucas Mendes","original_name":"Miguel Lucas Mendes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652b9c0e358da700ad353b40","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2147459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Castela","original_name":"João Castela","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652ba41af2883802a25e7749","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29432140","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.735,"height":1361,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fNJXBOj8Kns6zjuTJAC61F5GF0j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1001}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
