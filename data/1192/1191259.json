She is 28 and she is a veterinarian, so it is just natural for her to become a paramedic. But there is one \"but\" - her twelve-year-old son, Vitia, whom Kira is raising alone. So the first question is: with whom to leave the child? The second question is whether Kira can really leave her son? She has been a mother most of her life. She has always protected her son herself, always been there for him. Maybe it's time to protect something else?","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/9USg9LI7MN1YSxGZobtOq3J8MA3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140155,"logo_path":"/sK1dKpuXxuK5oXHbTCOzMWXDCcP.png","name":"Kyiv National I.
