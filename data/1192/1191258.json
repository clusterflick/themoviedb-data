His father and older brother are also employed here. Manuel works on a huge roller that is used to press out the sugar cane. His friends transport the squeezed sugar cane away, dry the remains on the farm or help transport the cut cane to the mill. The film shows Manuel's daily work and describes the different steps of sugar production on the plantation. Manuel hopes that his younger siblings will soon be able to help, because although Manuel contributes to the family income, it is often not enough to feed the family of nine.","popularity":0.1324,"poster_path":"/kFHyo0IL3zN5QNHqR0GbneOg8ge.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2708,"logo_path":null,"name":"Känguruh Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manuel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4320735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans-Georg Ulrich","original_name":"Hans-Georg Ulrich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652b03ab1511aa00c68b2bf6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1897337,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Detlef Gumm","original_name":"Detlef Gumm","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652b03960cb33516f74758ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2336563,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ralf Klingelhöfer","original_name":"Ralf Klingelhöfer","popularity":0.0343,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652b039b358da7011dd81db5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1131,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kFHyo0IL3zN5QNHqR0GbneOg8ge.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18068,"name":"teenage boy"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFF Oberhausen","release_date":"1990-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
