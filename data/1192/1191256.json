Over time, these grasslands have been drastically reduced in size and pushed back by agricultural lands. Life on the prairie also suffered. However, this prairie life is on the rise and the prairie dog plays an important key role. These small and sometimes funny prairie residents ensure healthy grasslands and help provide food for other animals on the prairie such as the bison. The film follows the lives of the prairie dogs and their closest neighbors.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aGGds6sSXyG6Gnury2bM5PD6kMW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Underdog, A Prairie Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4320731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroshi Egawa","original_name":"Hiroshi Egawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652b03591f3e60011c4a6e7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/aGGds6sSXyG6Gnury2bM5PD6kMW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
