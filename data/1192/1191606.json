The object of the game is to collect six different coloured \"Keystones\", face player's worst fear and thus beat the \"Gatekeeper\". Each player adopts the persona of one of the \"Harbingers\", otherwise must play as a \"Soul Ranger\". The game is set in a place known as \"The Other Side\". The Gatekeeper is to ensure the other characters do not \"escape\" from The Other Side. The game board is made up of a central hub and six two-sided interchangeable \"Provinces\" which fit together, creating a hexagon. A videotape is included with the game, and acts as a game clock. The videotape stars Wenanty Nosul as The Gatekeeper.","popularity":0.2848,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":211000,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Couple 'a Cowboys","origin_country":""},{"id":6220,"logo_path":"/cAj69EL1zSXmZH6STbMGZrunyMD.png","name":"Mattel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Monstruous characters try to escape the evil Gatekeeper in real time.","title":"Atmosfear: The Harbingers","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1775367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wenanty Nosul","original_name":"Wenanty Nosul","popularity":0.2098,"profile_path":"/suL2HEh3COP78zqRCazilKTAwDR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Gatekeeper","credit_id":"652bb1a20cb33516f63ee383","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17276044","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10090,"name":"board game"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
