Ahmed El Ouafi Bouguéra wins the gold medal and becomes the first Olympic champion from the African continent. He achieved his feat under the tricolor flag. The start of his real marathon is underway. The history of sport extends to the history of Algeria and France. This documentary retraces the different stages of the life of this great champion, not only the history of sport but also the great story. Archival photographs and interviews mingle with the painted paintings. The series thus once again gives voice to this forgotten hero, one of the great heroes of immigration who defended France for more than a century.","popularity":0.5753,"poster_path":"/4YkAS2NZfH7QJezkowGM7Ej2FZC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108911,"logo_path":"/7MfCZ6BEcamw4JLhPFGJETx6s9x.png","name":"Frozen
