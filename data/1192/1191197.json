These are the words of Rodaan Al Galidi, writer, poet, asylum seeker. Years ago, he fled his native Iraq and got locked up for years in various Dutch refugee centres. When his request for asylum is turned down, he goes into hiding in a student room. He keeps poems there that he wrote in Iraq and new, Dutch texts for which he has meanwhile won several awards. Rodaan turns out to be both a charming and melancholy man. He candidly talks about his life, his inspirations and passions.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/2UY6fMwI4HkczUaMsQzWIQ8zknZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73530,"logo_path":null,"name":"Van der Hoop Filmproducties","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2009-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Het woord heeft mij gered","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara den Uyl","original_name":"Barbara den Uyl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652af4b81511aa00e397e84c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475963,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leen van den Berg","original_name":"Leen van den Berg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652af4c4024ec80101519f72","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557648,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Brugman","original_name":"Peter Brugman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652af4d9024ec800aecb5a6d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713261,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gertjan Miedema","original_name":"Gertjan Miedema","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652af4ea0cb33516fec7baf6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1473768,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jac Vleeshouwers","original_name":"Jac Vleeshouwers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652af4f2358da7011dd819e5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446607,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jan Ketelaars","original_name":"Jan Ketelaars","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652af4fe358da700e3bd6276","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2UY6fMwI4HkczUaMsQzWIQ8zknZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":801}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
