He works at Resnick's Pharmacy to be able to earn enough money to put himself through college. But in part because of the life lessons he learns from Mr. Resnick through Mr. Resnick's somewhat cynical observations of the customers that come into the pharmacy, Howard is intrigued by an offer from George, his best friend, to tour Canada following their graduation instead of going directly into a post-secondary institution. This trip would not be a vacation, but rather an opportunity to see what life has to offer by meeting people from different parts of the country, while they work odd jobs along the way. This idea goes against the sensibilities of Howard's parents and Howard's girlfriend, Mary, who see this trip as just another impetuously stupid idea by flaky George. Howard has to try and reconcile all these competing forces in his life.  â€”Huggo","popularity":0.3023,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1957-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Howard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3594666,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Foster","original_name":"John Foster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62af8f311bf2660591b4072f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Haldane","original_name":"Don Haldane","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/8WJofKLT8R4vLrbBRceqbZeAtug.jpg","credit_id":"5e1418769020120018b9e21f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586012,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gordon Burwash","original_name":"Gordon Burwash","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e141895d64ac2001667cc0c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143485,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julian Biggs","original_name":"Julian Biggs","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e14191d5907de0017e22b6f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223480","wikidata_id":"Q123288430","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":704,"name":"adolescence"},{"id":10683,"name":"coming of age"},{"id":155294,"name":"family conflict"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1957-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
