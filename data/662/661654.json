This tunnel complex was well-known among graffiti artists, avoided by pedestrians but a fascinating example of an urban 'black hole'. The registration provides an overview of the happenings during the 'Underpass' project by Garcia, Wright, America and Wijnen: four Saturdays during which the Underpass became a public studio with light shows, live music performances, graffiti acts, performances and personal artistic statements made by citizens of Amsterdam.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Underpass","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2502663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie Wright","original_name":"Annie Wright","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e140a409020120013ba10c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2502644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lous America","original_name":"Lous America","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e140a0a5907de0014e15222","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2502658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Garcia","original_name":"David Garcia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e140a1f6262080016c50999","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2502662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henk Wijnen","original_name":"Henk Wijnen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e140a30d64ac2001667b026","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
