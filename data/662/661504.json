This is the big question in Sun Hee Engelstoft’s poignant heartbreaker of a film about three Korean women who have become pregnant outside of marriage and are now hiding from the outside world until they give birth. They live in a shelter for unwed mothers on a South Korean island, where beautiful landscapes are in sharp contrast to the fierce dilemma that women go through: should they keep their children or give them up for adoption? Engelstoft has been given unique access to this particular shelter run by the strong-willed Mrs. Im, who fights for the girls’ independence but is up against a social structure and family tradition that leaves women in an impossible situation. Engelstoft’s sensitive portrait brings us close to a forbidden world and through her own experience as a Korean adoptee, she gives a deeply personal and extraordinary insight into a culture in which women can’t choose their own fate.","popularity":0.122,"poster_path":"/utij7MlUQXE41jqwffsDtwgVY64.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":36270,"logo_path":"/diDSz5VPxV5AAYaDg1Ih8jJpCdu.png","name":"Korean Film Council","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":33813,"logo_path":null,"name":"DMZ Docs","origin_country":""},{"id":26398,"logo_path":"/4wqxgqiiQ3OSAlgc6LBzuuBe7Q3.png","name":"Den Vestdanske Filmpulje","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":25220,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Danish Screen","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":118,"logo_path":"/AiBorgNTCS1lT1FdFPYheax9jfF.png","name":"Det Danske Filminstitut","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":119,"logo_path":"/1di2gITGUZr730AMuMKiCrP90Vl.png","name":"DR","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":758,"logo_path":"/fft3jrctrZNcgAxgN1w5Givtzip.png","name":"TV 2","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2019-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forget Me Not","video":false,"vote_average":9.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Adoptiert -
