Her childhood ended when she was sexually abused for the first time at the age of 11. Even though she has a strong personality and speaks five languages fluently, she was never able to take care of herself. In the 1990s, she became one of the IT Girls of the post-reunification party scene in Berlin. She only feels safe among gay men. Decades of drug-abuse may have destroyed her brain, but not her personality.","popularity":0.1124,"poster_path":"/zRZTlsXpBQhhYJUcaQowPMx6VLK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Character One: Susan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Lienhard","original_name":"Tim Lienhard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1308f3d64ac2001665afcb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11745820","wikidata_id":"Q74812380","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/zRZTlsXpBQhhYJUcaQowPMx6VLK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":699},{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":858,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/bOlk2jsReaRhmUC5NYHD7zvuRsX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Achtung Berlin Filmfestival","release_date":"2018-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
