These images are set to the sound of an old film projector evoking a nostalgic and retro feel, as if the artist is evoking memories of herself. In the opening scenes we are introduced to a still shots of the artist performing different facial expressions. America plays with the notion of capturing differing moments in time. This is done in a stop-frame mode, where single frames of her expressions are placed one after the other creating a rickety and shaky feel to the movement of the imagery. As the work progresses, America multiplies the single frame in a grid across the screen.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Labyrinth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2502644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lous America","original_name":"Lous America","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1409909020120015b99038","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
