Throughout this work America performs slight variations in head and facial movement to a repetitive and absurd soundtrack. The face is presented as a blank yet mechanically expressive canvas and the expression in her eyes is non-directional and unemotive. This isolation and exaggeration of the different parts of her face gives the viewer the impression that what we see is an object rather than a person or individual. The visual composition is supported by a repetitive percussion beat with Jazz overtones and synthesizer sounds.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eye Wat Ching","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2502644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lous America","original_name":"Lous America","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e140941d8af670014c0a9f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
