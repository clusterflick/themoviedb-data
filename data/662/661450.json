Ignoring instructions to 'play down the gay angle', he centres the film on his own very candid conversations with two HIV+ young men. Sadly the identities of the interviewees have to be concealed, and so the freewheeling camerawork focuses most often on Tsai himself; but the sense of rapport between the director and his 'new friends' is palpable and very moving, even to Western viewers already only too familiar with these issues.","popularity":0.2731,"poster_path":"/4oRkofnllkyID3OCjvbKW06MdCb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My New Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tsai Ming-liang","original_name":"蔡明亮","popularity":0.566,"profile_path":"/ceVmDE537vnoxiGmkoNOf5srJWr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e138540d8af670012bf8795","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Kang-sheng","original_name":"李康生","popularity":0.5727,"profile_path":"/rdyfLsAHK0h1ijwdJbXtDJ0iGOd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e934f36ccb15f061c6e844f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pearlly Chua","original_name":"Pearlly Chua","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/byIg0gksCaD7oou5smvQhVwzJxG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e934f3eca4f67001480c866","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tsai Ming-liang","original_name":"蔡明亮","popularity":0.566,"profile_path":"/ceVmDE537vnoxiGmkoNOf5srJWr.jpg","credit_id":"5e138556fc5f0600159206f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0275794","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4oRkofnllkyID3OCjvbKW06MdCb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":740,"name":"aids"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
