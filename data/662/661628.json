She speaks about what she sees when flipping through different channels on TV, and what she reads when browsing through a magazine. She blends these distracted descriptions of media with thoughts on a past romantic experience and the possibility of a relationship with a new acquaintance. On screen, we see shots of a TV set surrounded by a dark room. The channel is frequently switched; the images on screen sometimes complement the woman's story and sometimes expand it in unexpected directions. Shots of a young man (played by the artist) turning towards the camera and pointing a gun towards the viewer are interspersed with the collage of TV clips.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sensible Shoes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1551848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Adams","original_name":"John Adams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e13fdd66c0b36001300730d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
