A pervasive mysticism draws to it those desperate to connect- whether it be to themselves, others, or the world around them. Iconicity revels in the sweeping expanses of raw beauty that inspire so many disparate souls to push themselves to the brink of their creativity. Here the spirit of the Wild West lives on, as off-the-gridders and renegade sculptors carve out an existence that challenges what it means to be free.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/kMewHXzFy85f2OEqI0CfzJGRPG0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":221084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mirage Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iconicity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2330025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Zahn","original_name":"Leo Zahn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e14d8b56262080014c616ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10061452","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kMewHXzFy85f2OEqI0CfzJGRPG0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
