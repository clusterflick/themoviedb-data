It is the recording apparatus that seems to capture these intangible currents and bring them under public scrutiny.Yet the status of what we are seeing remains indefinite, since the camera can also function as a catalyst. Do we really glimpse the inner 'truth 'of these individuals - or is it merely discomfort at the fact of being observed? A work of structured ambiguity that tests the camera 's capacity for violence.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Public Scenes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2503356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hanspeter Ammann","original_name":"Hanspeter Ammann","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e14f0022ea6b900159c058f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
