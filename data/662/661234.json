In winter, when the snow blurs the contours in the landscape Yuri turns 15. Lorenzo decides that she is now old enough to carry their family's generational rifle. Lorenzo, Yuri and her uncle Ivan drive deep inland to go on a hunting trip for a few days. But Yuri's 'rite de passage', this celebration and almost ritual initiation, takes a disastrous and irrevocable turn. Lorenzo struggles to place the impact the tragedy has on their lives.","popularity":0.3116,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":152078,"logo_path":"/qffwjrwRZxiGUbhZPMyPXjaCOlU.png","name":"Rotterdam
