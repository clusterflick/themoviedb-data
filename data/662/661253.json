She wants to be a helpmate, rather than just a plaything to him, but her attempts to study law are met with derision. So Rose leaves Rodney and goes to New York, explaining in a note that she will return when she has earned the right to be his equal. Rose heads for Broadway and lands in the chorus, but soon enough her talent as a designer is discovered and the great Ziegfeld gives her a two year contract to create the costumes for the Follies.","popularity":0.3232,"poster_path":"/vmIU3tEnFn4IKiO4PVCVsCFqm8c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164705,"logo_path":null,"name":"Florence Vidor Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Personally directed by KING VIDOR.
