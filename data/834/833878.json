She touches briefly on the various subjects dealt with: the return to Césarée of Berenice, repudiated for reasons of state, Jewish wandering, the scandal of the camps in the two Aurelia Steiner. Negative Hands as the colonial data of humanity, a film offered to the blacks and Portuguese who clean up Paris before leaving the place. Marguerite Duras also comments, with excerpts, on the various traveling shots that make up the main plot of each of the short films. And the documentary ends with a few words of epilogue: a real pamphlet by Marguerite Duras against dreams, significantly entitled Work and Words.","popularity":0.1776,"poster_path":"/e700mLj8QJvCcQSoQ1e8FPqhR6U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Work and Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marguerite Duras","original_name":"Marguerite Duras","popularity":0.3234,"profile_path":"/fcwhMcwUzh4AtHew16vS4OVDYdO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60af48ad8ee49c006dc319c1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63898,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jérôme Beaujour","original_name":"Jérôme Beaujour","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60af493ac1ffbd00567b074c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Mascolo","original_name":"Jean Mascolo","popularity":0.0986,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60af4958c1ffbd00567b076f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13495868","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.735,"height":2720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e700mLj8QJvCcQSoQ1e8FPqhR6U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
