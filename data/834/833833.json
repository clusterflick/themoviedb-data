He turns tricks as a transvestite, using the name Rosatigre, or more commonly, Rosa. His closest pal is Wanda, who exercises the same “profession” and, being his best friend, is also the incarnation of his feminine alter ego. While we watch the two of them hanging out on the street, sweet and carefree as the young Moll Flanders, we eavesdrop on their exchange of confidences and learn the secret details of their private lives. Wanda could have been a teacher but she preferred the street, where she can indulge her sentimental, dreamy nature in sighing over the \"Americano\" she once met in Naples, for whom she still carries a torch.","popularity":0.254,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":143518,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lontane Province Film","origin_country":""},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2001-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Working the Streets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filippo Timi","original_name":"Filippo Timi","popularity":0.224,"profile_path":"/jfb21HPkVokFmzOE2kT1vnlOgAa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Antonello","credit_id":"60af13381ad93b003f11620a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1344688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giulietta De Bernardi","original_name":"Giulietta De Bernardi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Wanda","credit_id":"60af135ad29bdd002c02a319","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2821511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Riccarelli","original_name":"Walter Riccarelli","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60af13684f9a99003fa2979c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3104875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Rava","original_name":"Antonio Rava","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60af137417792c00574560ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":226381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucia Mascino","original_name":"Lucia Mascino","popularity":0.1428,"profile_path":"/fgtvWOvKi9lCUzCC21XodglaA6C.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60af1383957e6d002a26a066","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2852104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuela Giacomini","original_name":"Manuela Giacomini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60af138a17b5ef0040e376a2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1344695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Momo","original_name":"Alberto Momo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"60af139287e63e0040bd79ec","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347287,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Piero Lassandro","original_name":"Piero Lassandro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60af1428c5c1ef0059e5f46e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonino De Bernardi","original_name":"Tonino De Bernardi","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/6t3K7VZymqWMpJKifzN6xEFlPqK.jpg","credit_id":"60af140030f79c0040bbf4dd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonino De Bernardi","original_name":"Tonino De Bernardi","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/6t3K7VZymqWMpJKifzN6xEFlPqK.jpg","credit_id":"60af141ddff66e002adc9fa3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonino De Bernardi","original_name":"Tonino De Bernardi","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/6t3K7VZymqWMpJKifzN6xEFlPqK.jpg","credit_id":"60af13f6d29bdd0043dea566","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filippo Timi","original_name":"Filippo Timi","popularity":0.224,"profile_path":"/jfb21HPkVokFmzOE2kT1vnlOgAa.jpg","credit_id":"60af140c00bfe80029e34378","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1984418,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lino Fiorito","original_name":"Lino Fiorito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60af143917792c006e1cb92b","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonino De Bernardi","original_name":"Tonino De Bernardi","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/6t3K7VZymqWMpJKifzN6xEFlPqK.jpg","credit_id":"60af1416f90b190029f6e599","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0498905","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
