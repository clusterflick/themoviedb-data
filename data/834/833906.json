The romantic tension between Adina and Nemorino electrifies the air. But they are not alone. A group of friends puts their love and social standing at risk.  Director Marcos Darbyshire’s contemporary version of Donizetti’s comic opera L’elisir d’amore is a coming-of-age opera exploring identity and loss of innocence. ‘There will be a lot of laughter, but with rather than at the characters’ promises the director. The all-Dutch co-production between Opera Zuid, Dutch National Touring Opera and Dutch National Opera features an excellent young cast from the Dutch National Opera Studio.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/gBdZywAeYVtFeWbixkLie4fYoy8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'elisir d'amore - DNO","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2946121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julietta Aleksanyan","original_name":"Julietta Aleksanyan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60af68a7955c6500573dff6e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose Romero","original_name":"Jose Romero","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60af68c317b5ef006ea912ec","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Mkhize","original_name":"Martin Mkhize","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60af68cb17b5ef0040e3bb13","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Carl","original_name":"Sam Carl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60af68d317b5ef005712e064","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bibi Ortjens","original_name":"Bibi Ortjens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60af68dc4f9a990056994bf9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcos Darbyshire","original_name":"Marcos Darbyshire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60af68f1f90b19003f84d5ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105038,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Enrico Delamboye","original_name":"Enrico Delamboye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60af68e65b07140078960a32","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gBdZywAeYVtFeWbixkLie4fYoy8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
