Invented in 1926 by the architect Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky for the housing project “New Frankfurt,” the Frankfurt Kitchen was lauded for its low cost, high efficiency, hygienic design, and mass reproducibility. Wolff’s film demonstrates these qualities by comparing women at work in “old” and “new” kitchens, and through the use of animated diagrams demonstrating, in Taylorist fashion, the efficiency of labor in the new kitchen.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rWWLI6hMbDIGrKDhjpG6kGGc0C2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135139,"logo_path":null,"name":"Humboldt-Film GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1928-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Frankfurt Kitchen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3102366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Wolff","original_name":"Paul Wolff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ac17913d355700403b8316","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1341,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rWWLI6hMbDIGrKDhjpG6kGGc0C2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":894}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1928-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
