During this period of deportation by the Soviet invaders, the men were separated from their families and sent to the Gulag. Some were sentenced to the highest punishment, death, and the rest were kept in labor camps. The women and children were sent to the remote Krasnoyarsk and Tomsk districts. The first two years were the most difficult and many perished from the harsh conditions. Today some 400 of those deported children still live in Latvia and Siberia. This documentary describes the fate of these children.","popularity":0.058,"poster_path":"/tuLYHk8g1MnQ32fJLfJ3TKSZUWb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118793,"logo_path":"/AckxUfY5wGZjKNnbiWDKubqxX8t.png","name":"Latvijas Televizija","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2001-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children of Siberia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","original_name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xkoDazTXGrxNWMU2XPfTyXpisOg.jpg","credit_id":"60afb144f90b19005729ab53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armands Zvirbulis","original_name":"Armands Zvirbulis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60afb1e9f90b19006d81ea27","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armands Zvirbulis","original_name":"Armands Zvirbulis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60afb1de17b5ef0029758b05","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","original_name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xkoDazTXGrxNWMU2XPfTyXpisOg.jpg","credit_id":"60afb15e955c6500573e300d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","original_name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xkoDazTXGrxNWMU2XPfTyXpisOg.jpg","credit_id":"60afb16951f99a00582245e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105267,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ingars Leitis","original_name":"Ingars Leitis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60afb21717792c005745dcc2","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333858,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aivars Lubānietis","original_name":"Aivars Lubānietis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60afb22eecbde90029342d4e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105268,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Igors Tūns","original_name":"Igors Tūns","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60afb2454f9a990078785fb9","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732297,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pēteris Vasks","original_name":"Pēteris Vasks","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":"/sydsEChqbQifMFNRgDai2U58a3R.jpg","credit_id":"60afb26817b5ef0029758bbe","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2879558,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arturs Maskats","original_name":"Arturs Maskats","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a9bd09086f5483760f795e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1032245","wikidata_id":"Q61121839","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tuLYHk8g1MnQ32fJLfJ3TKSZUWb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
