The journey was from the Ramses square, one of the largest squares in Cairo, to his new place on the grand Egyptian Museum. It was the biggest transfer process Cairo streets ever witnessed, a journey that took over 12 hours in the charming Cairo atmosphere.  Amr is inspired by this journey to tell the story of the relation between the authority and the people, and his personal relation with his father who was a symbol of superior authority in his youth.","popularity":0.1375,"poster_path":"/Aqe47NNtLSNcS8sPgziSRJGVwjC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137966,"logo_path":null,"name":"RAHALA Production & Distribution","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"}],"release_date":"2019-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where Did Ramses Go?","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2727976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amr Bayoumi","original_name":"Amr Bayoumi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zrsbqD8hhD5x3Yryz2JXmiFzJlX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f2469e066eba7003884bade","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2727979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naji Ismail","original_name":"Naji Ismail","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f246a25e22d28003560905c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2727976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amr Bayoumi","original_name":"Amr Bayoumi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zrsbqD8hhD5x3Yryz2JXmiFzJlX.jpg","credit_id":"5f246a54498ef90037aca5de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2727981,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ahmed El-Shebiny","original_name":"Ahmed El-Shebiny","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f246a79498ef90038ad0b0b","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2727976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amr Bayoumi","original_name":"Amr Bayoumi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zrsbqD8hhD5x3Yryz2JXmiFzJlX.jpg","credit_id":"5f2469f6f0647c0035221ede","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2727987,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ahmed Abu El-Fadl","original_name":"Ahmed Abu El-Fadl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f246b2c1b70ae00359ed8f9","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2727986,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ahmed Omran","original_name":"Ahmed Omran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f246b01869e7500385549bf","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2727983,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Osama El-Werdany","original_name":"Osama El-Werdany","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f246abc66eba7003584570a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2727988,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Magdy Youssef","original_name":"Magdy Youssef","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f246b756f31af00389923fa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2727976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amr Bayoumi","original_name":"Amr Bayoumi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zrsbqD8hhD5x3Yryz2JXmiFzJlX.jpg","credit_id":"5f246b8b498ef90036acd68a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933493,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mohab Ezz","original_name":"Mohab Ezz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f246b48dfaae900359ef1ed","department":"Crew","job":"Mix Technician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Aqe47NNtLSNcS8sPgziSRJGVwjC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"english_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ar\", \"native_name\"=>\"Arabic\"}","note":"http://ismailiafilmfest.com/ismailia2019/20190416_En.aspx","release_date":"2019-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"WHERE DID RAMSES GO?
