Though falling sometimes into her own depression and anxieties in a time when the world stops and forces people to look into themselves for “renewal” of spirit, body and soul, Nang Em, fights through these negativities. She will show us how it is in the eyes of someone who went through time with grace and reckless abandon. And when an Ilonggo maintenance guy, Tagalog, comes to dip his mundane life into the scene of this wisdom-filled woman, we see how worlds come to connect and fill the gap of these times that don’t seem to mean anything to each other. We realize there is a thin line between old and new for a future set for the taking. Nang Em will open eyes to a whole understanding of being “old” in the time of “new.”","popularity":0.1297,"poster_path":"/9rOdFXeWiBpJ0cLiRFAX6KO16fz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2020-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nang Em","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1122083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Sevilla","original_name":"Gloria Sevilla","popularity":0.1769,"profile_path":"/5uo9e7XPNz4W0aGm7ayTIe5lgK8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nang Em","credit_id":"5f2965dfd8cc4a00381c76d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1345103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manu Respall","original_name":"Manu Respall","popularity":0.1131,"profile_path":"/4YiyzmvPk1f5j79EW4zxxuRi1Gj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tagalog","credit_id":"5f2965ed2d8ef30036ddce9f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jolevs Domingo","original_name":"Jolevs Domingo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Maintenance Guy 2","credit_id":"5f2b67dd2d8ef30036e32e5b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2384274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria S.
