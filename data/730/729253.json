Commissioned by Cambodian Living Arts, the Requiem is a first-time collaboration between filmmaker Rithy Panh and composer Dr. Him Sophy. The film tracks the story of the Cambodian creators and musicians, as they work with an international team to bring the production to the world stage. Alongside the evolving stage production, the film tells the first-hand survival stories of the Cambodians involved in the Requiem, and their powerful will to reclaim an artistic heritage that disappeared during the four years of Pol Pot terror.","popularity":0.0722,"poster_path":"/51djWlT7N4AcQ5hB1jx5683dF6o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Wandering Souls follows the mounting of a new stage production, Bangsokol: A Requiem for Cambodia","title":"Wandering Souls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rithy Panh","original_name":"Rithy Panh","popularity":0.1782,"profile_path":"/fMfHlfQMTGbg17DfDR0WSyg9xOj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Filmmaker, Designer","credit_id":"5f2550b50231f2003619afe9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Him Sophy","original_name":"Him Sophy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Composer","credit_id":"5f2550c90231f2003919be7c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728326,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vanna Seang","original_name":"Vanna Seang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2551042ac4990035633745","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064328,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Arestides ASE","original_name":"Andrew Arestides ASE","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f255120f0647c003327e357","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aviva Ziegler","original_name":"Aviva Ziegler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2550e7869e75003859dacb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":874,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/51djWlT7N4AcQ5hB1jx5683dF6o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":583}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
