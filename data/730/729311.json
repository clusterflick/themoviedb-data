Join Andre Phillip, Stav Niarchos, Marc Ramseier, Elliot Leboe, and Gianni Aragno as they island-hop their way from their private slider park in Antigua to sessions in Rarotonga, Cabarete, Fuerteventura, and Maui.  Follow Pete Cabrinha out to Peahi (Jaws), Maui to surf the swell of the decade. Witness his record breaking ride on a 70 foot wave which landed him the prestigious Billabong XXL award and his entry into the Guinness Book of World Records for the largest wave ever ridden. Metropolis is filmed and edited in the same creative vein that produced many accolades for Elliot Leboe’s first production – Ten 4.","popularity":0.0504,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metropolis","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Metropolis - A Kitesurfing Journey","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1692869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Cabrinha","original_name":"Pete Cabrinha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/iAowaVWb8vZPmpeSEcp1rWaWPxP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6127e2b8dff66e0043cd6bb2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andre Phillip","original_name":"Andre Phillip","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6127e2cac175b20063e5088c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stav Niarchos","original_name":"Stav Niarchos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6127e2d7d266a20060e81529","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Ramseier","original_name":"Marc Ramseier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6127e2df81140f008b771e02","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elliot Leboe","original_name":"Elliot Leboe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6127e2eb6c449c004293cf0e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damien Leroy","original_name":"Damien Leroy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6127e2f3c175b20027c50628","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Gilbert","original_name":"Julie Gilbert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6127e2ffe04aca00909781b8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianni Aragno","original_name":"Gianni Aragno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6127e3092dffd80061540af4","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elliot Leboe","original_name":"Elliot Leboe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6127e277373ac20044a99372","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elliot Leboe","original_name":"Elliot Leboe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6127e23ccb71b8009797f85d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1692869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Cabrinha","original_name":"Pete Cabrinha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/iAowaVWb8vZPmpeSEcp1rWaWPxP.jpg","credit_id":"6127e268d266a2002cd25cc4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15411398","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Metropolis - A kitesurfing journey","key":"2HtFTfOeRuk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2017-01-22T13:22:40.000Z","id":"5f25a8dcdbbb420035e02355"}]}}}
