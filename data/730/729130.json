When a young Ayrshire band miraculously hits the big time with the smash hit record of 1984, international stardom beckons. That’s despite having a delusional teenage manager propelled by a dark, malign voice in his head. Can Max Mojo’s band of talented social misfits repeat the success and pay back the mounting debts accrued from an increasingly agitated cartel of local gangsters? Or will they have to kidnap Boy George and hope for the best?  Written by critically acclaimed Scottish Author David F Ross, Miraculous is based on his internationally successful novel “The Rise and Fall of the Miraculous Vespas” which tells the timeless story of the quest for pop immortality.","popularity":0.5342,"poster_path":"/hYE65EnhHecEzRKOsXtQIaIbSMQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137963,"logo_path":null,"name":"Into Creative","origin_country":""},{"id":137964,"logo_path":null,"name":"Borderline Theatre","origin_country":""},{"id":137965,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gaiety Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Rise and Fall of the Miraculous Vespas","title":"Miraculous","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tam Dean Burn","original_name":"Tam Dean Burn","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/9KvZPsDzvP58t1vIvEK0m1x36YZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Max Mojo","credit_id":"5f2467152ac49900355d4b01","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin McCredie","original_name":"Colin McCredie","popularity":0.1774,"profile_path":"/pIQWX0jseCHS97d6dk3JvcJ7hWu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Grant Delgado","credit_id":"5f2467052ac49900355d4af0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1524855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah McCardie","original_name":"Sarah McCardie","popularity":0.1608,"profile_path":"/cryIuJv90YU7xq0UeKJJIIUR21P.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Norma Niven","credit_id":"5f246724e22d28003760b20e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2727968,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David F Ross","original_name":"David F Ross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2467f96f31af0038991e40","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836135,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stuart Hepburn","original_name":"Stuart Hepburn","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/9PCH4YbmmghFaFQheZCXzFgGdEE.jpg","credit_id":"5f24680a6f31af003799176a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2727969,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Stephen Cameron","original_name":"Stephen Cameron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f24681c1b70ae00349ed6ad","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"BorderlineTheatreCo","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"BorderlineCo"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hYE65EnhHecEzRKOsXtQIaIbSMQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":852}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Miraculous","key":"pMo142B9Bms","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-31T18:00:11.000Z","id":"5f246990168ea30038b35543"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Miraculous - Borderline Theatre Company Trailer","key":"txnGquPdjBs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-28T16:12:34.000Z","id":"5f24694e66eba7003884ba09"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Miraculous - Trailer","key":"435038141","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-03T11:24:10.000Z","id":"5f2469296f31af0037991990"}]}}}
