Some kind of teenage wasteland feel, unexpected storms and inviting landscapes are intermeshed. In a bewitching atmosphere, proximity and distance are revealed through a thoughtful structure where images and sounds confound the imaginary and the real.

Only by looking back do we find ourselves in a moon-like space/place.","popularity":0.0852,"poster_path":"/uyN7paW6D2iydcZ2OJ0hJSyNBh8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"special dark glass somewhere","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1658498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Clermont","original_name":"Charlotte Clermont","popularity":0.0799,"profile_path":"/ApndoVBBtFqQQY8So2u9NPqHPwr.jpg","credit_id":"5f263c1bd9403500355a2bec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uyN7paW6D2iydcZ2OJ0hJSyNBh8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Alchemy Film & Arts","release_date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"special dark glass somewhere","key":"366656019","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-16T04:30:36.000Z","id":"5f263cd0d9403500355a3367"}]}}}
