Forty years later, the son of one of these men reported this event in a book of poems, as a metaphor of the Portuguese travel literature of the 16Th and 17Th centuries. After, it occurred to him to turn the poems into a real event, to invite some friends to reenact the raft journey and exhibit texts from those peregrinations. His brother went along to film the floating recital.","popularity":0.1978,"poster_path":"/yosr2YwQb10AHfbyyhxIQnaUIha.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2013-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bibliografia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1170004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Leite","original_name":"Maria Leite","popularity":0.1298,"profile_path":"/8qCNVJdYUSUOYSLhW4ZkQxa5d3g.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f25ac39869e75003558f536","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364145,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Natxo Checa","original_name":"Natxo Checa","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f25ac422d8ef30035d4222d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Manso","original_name":"Miguel Manso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f25ac4d2d8ef30038d5b49c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"António Poppe","original_name":"António Poppe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f25ac558d1b8e00366a3257","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Manso","original_name":"João Manso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f25abbd869e75003558f479","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Manso","original_name":"Miguel Manso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f25ac0e2ac499003461561d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048630,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Leandro Valente (Lee Fuzeta)","original_name":"Lee Fuzeta","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/dPgP9avBG6xr7HJDtpWWIxJw61g.jpg","credit_id":"5f25ac997d41aa00336677a0","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Manso","original_name":"João Manso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f25abc20231f200391c1b13","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276860,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tomás Baltazar","original_name":"Tomás Baltazar","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f25ac8f2d8ef30037d72b8c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Manso","original_name":"Miguel Manso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f25ac136f31af00389f13b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2847888","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":836,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yosr2YwQb10AHfbyyhxIQnaUIha.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
