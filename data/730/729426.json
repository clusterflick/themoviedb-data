The time during COVID-19. There's so much to be concerned about, but this film shows how young kids can still thrive. It is important that we focus on what's really important in life right now. If nothing else, I hope thinking about COVID-19 through a different lens will change people's perspectives during this difficult time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Growing Up COVID","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rylee Landau","original_name":"Rylee Landau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f267124dbbb420035e400cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Growing Up COVID","key":"zy81xq4BPUM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-11T13:52:05.000Z","id":"5f267105dbbb420035e4008a"}]}}}
