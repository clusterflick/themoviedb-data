The Jaguar XJR-5s, factory Lancias and a strong field of privately-entered Porches would be chasing hard for the win. As the sun set, the first signs of the mechanical gremlins which would neutralise the works Porsche strategy appeared, with the 962C of Le Mans legend Jacky Ickx and Jochen Mass making the first of many stops for repairs.
