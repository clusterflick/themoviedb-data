In the lives of Anton (Mårble), Stas (DJ 1985) and mark (Mississippi Landscapes) there are performances at the Boiler Room and Present Perfect — and urban weekdays with \"Pyaterochka\" and canteens, strange parties, jams on the roof panels, escapes to the village. In the gap between them, there is a lot of talk about music, creativity, and what allows them to remain themselves and not look for ways into the mainstream.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/uURvJKLLNbeBm2UrylX8X7ztGPj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landscapes of Rivers (And Other Ways to Speak with Yourself)","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2727898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Voropaev","original_name":"Mikhail Voropaev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f245a56869e75003554f561","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uURvJKLLNbeBm2UrylX8X7ztGPj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Beat Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
