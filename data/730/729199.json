However, the dominant works Rothmans Porsches were equal to the challenge and prepared three of the awesome turbo-charged 962Cs to face the V12 British attack.

The hours of darkness would claim one of the Jaguars, Win Percy luckily escaping a massive crash - captured on this review by an amateur cameraman. Reliability problems would be Jaguar's undoing, a second car retiring with eight hours to go and the final XJR-8LM dropping down the order as it battled mechanical woes. That left the Porsche of Derek Bell, Hans-Joachim Stuck and Al Holbert virtually unchallenged in the final hours, but the victory was no less sweeter for that - they had taken Jaguar on, and won.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/8eLQPSvKNRoqv6zYPQyDMMGI5lh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":54057,"logo_path":null,"name":"Videovision Entertainment Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Le Mans","title":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 1987","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8eLQPSvKNRoqv6zYPQyDMMGI5lh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD","release_date":"2008-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
