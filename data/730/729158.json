When plans collapse things start to get interesting. Roads dissolve into deserts, swamps, and rivers until they reach the 80 kilometres of open sea separating Russia from Alaska, the Bering Strait.  Their unreliable motorcycles suffer ongoing breakdowns and the raw and rugged terrain throws them the most unrelenting difficult challenges. Equipped with no more than naivety and persistence they somehow make their way through the most isolated corners of the world.  After 20,000 km of breakdowns, all roads end and the only way to get closer to the Bering Strait is by The Kolyma, a remote 1,600 km long river. To cross it, the group build an amphibious motorcycle rig that will lead them closer to Bering Strait.","popularity":0.0734,"poster_path":"/dWNnXmhpVxihLnsfaaJLEeXUvQ8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"972 Breakdowns - On The Landway to New York","video":false,"vote_average":9.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2760858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Knödler","original_name":"Anne Knödler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f4c068801757f0034fe2d99","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2760860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth  Oertel","original_name":"Elisabeth  Oertel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f4c06c165e0a200324fed66","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2760861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Fötsch","original_name":"Johannes Fötsch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f4c06e7c525c4003137d915","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2760862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaupo Holmberg","original_name":"Kaupo Holmberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f4c070c223a8b0035ad93d4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2760863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Efy Zeniou","original_name":"Efy Zeniou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f4c074874507d0034ad2e11","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2728069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel von Rüdiger","original_name":"Daniel von Rüdiger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2489ac1b70ae00349f3f2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12872768","wikidata_id":"Q98684559","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1f5TJs5c8J6lHSsSzfJhuj1XJZs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1636}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":2326,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dWNnXmhpVxihLnsfaaJLEeXUvQ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1640},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/qMfzyGtj3eNFtApy9kCEu6amKNT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
