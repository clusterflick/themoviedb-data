The storyline subtly references the murder of Ahmed Jabbar Kareem Ali, a 15-year-old boy drowned by British troops in 2003 after accused of looting in one of the tributaries of the Euphrates in Southern Iraq called Shatt al-Basra. His fictional ghost anchors the narrative by raising questions about power manifested by those who control access to the river and land, its resources and history.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/ArjuMzSebNqqMUmDstaHcgoAWqx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weak Enough To Hear: A Deluge In Six Acts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2729708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Kalmenson","original_name":"Felix Kalmenson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2775692d8ef30036d909c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2729707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rouzbeh Akhbari","original_name":"Rouzbeh Akhbari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f27755dc8a5ac0034f6a9c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ArjuMzSebNqqMUmDstaHcgoAWqx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
