Progress and crisis, labour and capital, material and memory, are reflected through a very intelligent rhyme between image and sound. The touching voice and words of Niemeyer as a call for life, and the beautiful camerawork as a weaving of ghosts in the present landscapes.","popularity":0.3697,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Concrete Forms of Resistance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Jordan","original_name":"Nick Jordan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f25280ad940350037545579","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Jordan","original_name":"Nick Jordan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f25281fbe55b7003440d9ba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Jordan","original_name":"Nick Jordan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2528282ac499003562993f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10949566","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6096,"name":"furniture"},{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sheffield Doc/Fest virtual festival","release_date":"2020-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
