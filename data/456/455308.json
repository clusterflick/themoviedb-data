The Indians make merry to celebrate his homecoming. Hal Benton, an easterner, rides on to ask his way to the hotel, where he is stopping with some friends, among them his fianc√©e, Veda Mead, and her father. Knowing that the Indian ceremonies will interest his friends, Hal obtains permission to come the next day and bring his friends. The Chief calls Morning Star, an Indian maiden, telling his son that she is to be his squaw. Silver Water is pleased with her. The next day Hal Benton and his friends arrive. While the others inspect the camp, Veda Mead amuses herself with Silver Water and ere long is thoroughly infatuated with him, while the Indian's vanity is touched by the attentions of the society coquette, and he promises to meet her the next day. Their little tete-a-tete is cut short by the entrance of Morning Star.","popularity":0.2189,"poster_path":"/qlIbdsM5PjfwnsF37l8GALliUpp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nestor Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Indian Hero","video":false,"vote_average":4.667,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Conway","original_name":"Jack Conway","popularity":0.3204,"profile_path":"/eMA6PQ0OEnAZM9wZjkflrAO3rkL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hal Benton","credit_id":"5906121cc3a3684a7601ea86","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Gebhardt","original_name":"George Gebhardt","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/yUsuLBxrWP6wO152fkS8ssHTmIg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Silver Water","credit_id":"5906122b92514169b801ffdd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Davenport","original_name":"Dorothy Davenport","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/mS2sibbJ4046yDGmocE43LRWeil.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Veda Mead","credit_id":"5906123ec3a3684ab40214db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1470714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Forde","original_name":"Victoria Forde","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/eKZ5rsIgqb6xFS0JfIxMFMylDiv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Morning Star","credit_id":"5906124b92514169fb021333","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Bassett","original_name":"Russell Bassett","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/pbXbUVDldsRS2WNNdIPEQ1vsvoU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mr. Mead - Veda's Father","credit_id":"5906125b9251416a14020da9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1253930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugenie Forde","original_name":"Eugenie Forde","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/qSoVMe9x5dS2Wq0qA6gQDYxMvK1.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Morning Star's Mother","credit_id":"5906126a9251416a14020db6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313481,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Horsley","original_name":"David Horsley","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/QN2sRRVszIljtffoCxbrmE17zu.jpg","credit_id":"6388d8e1229ae21572aaf7a3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milton J.
