The camera usually observes the visitors and paints their views on scenes of the ensemble of figures. The amazement at the beauty and grace of the antique sculptures is reflected in the faces of the viewers and emotion is palpable. The visitors come from all over the world - one sees Indians, Asians, Blacks. All age groups are represented, from children to old people. They come individually or in groups and communicate about what they see. The film gets along without any comment. You see more pictures of the visitors than of the altar. This means that it is important for the film to show the cultural interest of the people. Gerhard Rosenfeld creates atmospheric music with a classical feel to it. An early and extremely interesting work by the great documentary filmmaker Jürgen Böttcher.","popularity":0.0762,"poster_path":"/6WoBPUc6h84nfaOBhWuEsb0iDff.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Pergamom Museum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1621513,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christian Lehmann","original_name":"Christian Lehmann","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590983309251411cf3009aa0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45556,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gerhard Rosenfeld","original_name":"Gerhard Rosenfeld","popularity":0.0711,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590983419251411ce4009a0f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Böttcher","original_name":"Jürgen Böttcher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zzgq3s7shKd6zIabGIIG3s7afxq.jpg","credit_id":"59098317c3a36835ee009a17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Böttcher","original_name":"Jürgen Böttcher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zzgq3s7shKd6zIabGIIG3s7afxq.jpg","credit_id":"590983289251411ce9009acc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0416845","wikidata_id":"Q28793291","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6WoBPUc6h84nfaOBhWuEsb0iDff.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":773,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ieUTR60sWhztxk4HJeosaazn0il.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
