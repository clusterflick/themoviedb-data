After hours of looking and ready to give up, he stumbles upon something incredibly bizarre; a brand new cabinet mysteriously placed in the woods. Carl's curiosity leads to unspeakable horrors that only his wife (Lauren Dougherty) has a chance of stopping! The Cabinet in the Woods is an obscure, daring cult thriller born from the alliance of multi-award winning director, Andrew Schwarz (SEPARATION), and cinematographer/editor, Bob Klein. Featuring thrilling special effects and makeup by Hinano Leung and Cuty Lin, these ambitious filmmakers have created a body horror classic that has to be seen to be believed.","popularity":0.1287,"poster_path":"/5op1QqZulBO66yKPHSJbNZJeu1y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
