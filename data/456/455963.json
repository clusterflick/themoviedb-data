Set in a dystopian near-future where civil liberties are trampled by an unrestrained federal government, the film’s crowd funded trailer was enthusiastically received by the burgeoning online community of libertarians, Tea Party activists and members of the nascent alt-right. In January of 2015, Crowley was found dead with his family in their suburban Minnesota home. Their shocking deaths quickly become a cause célèbre for conspiracy theorists who speculate that Crowley was assassinated by a shadowy government concerned about a film and filmmaker that was getting too close to the truth about their aims.","popularity":1.084,"poster_path":"/lN3oLLYfOlNkxmbMK6enKsdupSn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7315,"logo_path":"/pn1L5r75URMfY1XQB38NLKTlX3U.png","name":"A&E IndieFilms","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Gray State","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":43,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1948318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Crowley","original_name":"David Crowley","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/oxmxY0uPtgSrUJ0S1JN7DC3ZLTh.jpg","cast_id":28,"character":"Self - Director, \"Gray State\" (archive footage)","credit_id":"6629a4befd140b011c4e497b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny August Mason","original_name":"Danny August Mason","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":48,"character":"Self - \"Gray State\" Co-Creator / Actor","credit_id":"6629c1a00dea6e011c75ddac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex E.
