Through interviews with men and women of all ages, classes, and sexual orientation, the film lifts a corner of the veil that usually shrouds discussion of this subject in the Arab world.  Made by an Algerian-French woman director, the film begins by looking at the record of a more permissive history, and ends with the experiences of contemporary lovers from mixed backgrounds. It examines the personal issues raised by the desire for pleasure, amidst societal pressures for chastity and virginity.  The film discusses pre-marital sex, courtship and marriage, familial pressures, private vs. public spaces, social taboos (and the desire to break them), and issues of language.","popularity":0.4288,"poster_path":"/tsO5BOKUXV33eSwdlVo1j1GhGkH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Perfumed Garden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1162099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yamina Benguigui","original_name":"Yamina Benguigui","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5904d00692514169b800eae9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":910,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tsO5BOKUXV33eSwdlVo1j1GhGkH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3679,"name":"society"},{"id":738,"name":"sexuality"},{"id":2132,"name":"literature"},{"id":187,"name":"islam"},{"id":10235,"name":"family relationships"},{"id":11921,"name":"sociology"},{"id":34214,"name":"gender"},{"id":40870,"name":"race"},{"id":212815,"name":"arab stereotype"},{"id":215276,"name":"arab world"},{"id":215277,"name":"arab culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2000-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
