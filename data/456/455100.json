This moving image edit is derived from about 4 or 5 takes on the day venus was to cross the sun's path. As it turned out I got the day wrong, but it wouldn't have mattered as the image that formed on the vellum was so soft and wispish and the trees were in the way that there was no chance whatsoever venus could be seen passing by.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9EE9SWcG3wzMBbPvPWYg6Axk7kA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Obscura Camera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1600743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Murray","original_name":"Julie Murray","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/7cn5OdrBhROj5VrVBTph4XsSvnw.jpg","credit_id":"590496b292514169e100c929","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9EE9SWcG3wzMBbPvPWYg6Axk7kA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":798}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
