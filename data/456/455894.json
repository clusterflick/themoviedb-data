'It’s like a theatre here', one says in the beginning of the film, and it indeed is, the Theater of Life. The young women working in the office have a job that shifts from being verbally attacked and called idiots, to situations where they are subject to flirt, or where they master the happy ceremony of marriage. Faces, joy, sorrow, fun, despair... It’s all very well composed, rhythmical, with atmosphere conveyed, and lives up to what a documentary should be: multilayered and universal. And about Life.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":"/iBdWEgmtdyVdROWJQe8fVPs0QvJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54667,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Lendoc","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2005-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Civil Status","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RW","title":"Grazhdanskoe sostoyanie","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3049933,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dmitry Aksenov","original_name":"Dmitry Aksenov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6074c0b44d0e8d002c589c51","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1209492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Rudnitskaya","original_name":"Alina Rudnitskaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bUM58gaTGgvEJLKkj1vu7zQJ0K6.jpg","credit_id":"590ace169251414f8d01071a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1808659,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexander Filippov","original_name":"Alexander Filippov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gIdo6O0jiyszdbS5eKGADsDTEHI.jpg","credit_id":"5b6e0a210e0a267ef815b333","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1209492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Rudnitskaya","original_name":"Alina Rudnitskaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bUM58gaTGgvEJLKkj1vu7zQJ0K6.jpg","credit_id":"5db2a4734b0c630014ea1b8e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2440235,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Larisa Solovtsova","original_name":"Larisa Solovtsova","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db2a4ddd40d4c0014f6ee31","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2043240,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexey Telnov","original_name":"Alexey Telnov","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db2a48725a5360018df272f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2104294,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vyacheslav Telnov","original_name":"Vyacheslav Telnov","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/szRQBVtVz70ZVfDRsJx3pbuWluZ.jpg","credit_id":"5db2a4a84b0c630017ea3d21","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iBdWEgmtdyVdROWJQe8fVPs0QvJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Oberhausen International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2006-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2005-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Civil status (Гражданское состояние) with Eng subs","key":"95950053","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2014-05-21T09:17:14.000Z","id":"5db2a6bbd40d4c0014f6f1dd"}]}}}
