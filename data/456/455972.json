Provides an almost hour-long look at the band and its crew during the final dates of their 2002 Vapor Trails Tour, specifically their first-ever Brazilian shows in Porto Alegre, Sao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro. Behind the scenes footage shows the band weathering the rigors of a sometimes comically catastrophic tour, with their innate humor and grace. This documentary, by longtime Rush photographer Andrew MacNaughtan, shows the band and crew at their most light-hearted, though still thoughtful. We see the band's arrival in Brazil, to the unexpected onslaught of Brazillian fans boiled over in the culmination of a lifetime's anticipation. Following this are insights from the band and their crew, which provide a view into their longevity as well as ample evidence of the individual strengths and varied senses of humor that helped them achieve it.","popularity":0.6794,"poster_path":"/lR5P3KWtnhwws0TJpoSvO4g9uK8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coming Home Entertainment Group","origin_country":""},{"id":118238,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anthem Entertainment Group Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boys in Brazil","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geddy Lee","original_name":"Geddy Lee","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/raaVKa1Dr29hLCZhY7ryOsaNSqx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5cd60b380e0a262e09cac926","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Lifeson","original_name":"Alex Lifeson","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/7daAAB0ZXXsq82IxdBPoCFcyoOz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cd60b43c3a36817bdc024df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Peart","original_name":"Neil Peart","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/q5VO9FDmiG7iz36SBfj5m1UfH33.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cd60b4d92514106f3cd83b4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2309766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Blazier","original_name":"Craig Blazier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cd60ecbc3a36817cec023e4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2309768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlene Lifeson","original_name":"Charlene Lifeson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5cd60edc0e0a262defcacd99","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2309770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shelley Nott","original_name":"Shelley Nott","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5cd60eefc3a36817c9c0292e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1216119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Warnock","original_name":"Neil Warnock","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5cd60efec3a36817d7c027a5","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1810356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew MacNaughtan","original_name":"Andrew MacNaughtan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590b6d49c3a3686a9500162d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0403894","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kqqQRM1xmxAI7Oig1lPGiivvp35.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1919}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lR5P3KWtnhwws0TJpoSvO4g9uK8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1125},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z80Bd54Ee2wHkFSDORmtO8xgfj0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254364,"name":"rush"},{"id":254365,"name":"geddy lee"},{"id":254366,"name":"alex lifeson"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
