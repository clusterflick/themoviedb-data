Beny and Esty love each other very much but they are unfortunate. One day, they find themselves unemployed, and if that's not enough, the bank is about to confiscate their apartment in a housing project, if they don't settle their mortgage debt within a month. The two search for creative solutions to obtain the money, while each of them believes that his solution is saner.
