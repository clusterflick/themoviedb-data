Roger Minassian who at the age of 53 left the security of his pastorate to step outside his comfort zone to do the truly amazing. Knowing nothing about gang youth, he took to the streets and transformed our city, ravaged by gang violence, by taking over 1,700 gang kids off of our streets. It is also the story of Santos Delgado, a gang member, who at age 16 had no future and little hope. He knew his future was either prison or death. His girlfriend was pregnant. He had to make life-changing decisions. This film is about taking risk, embracing change, overcoming the impossible, and finding hope.","popularity":0.3611,"poster_path":"/yv6xevDude8rBacGZnIP6Csg3Lg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Streets of Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Finding Hope Now","type":"Original Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Badalucco","original_name":"Michael Badalucco","popularity":0.4286,"profile_path":"/ntqAjxrBsyXbRzAaln4ynSBTE1r.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Roger Minassian","credit_id":"59091ee89251411cef00149c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avan Jogia","original_name":"Avan Jogia","popularity":1.4415,"profile_path":"/7BX0Lg39bHlgtvWZpszTr1YjTAW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Santos Delgado","credit_id":"59091ef59251411ce400146e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1640396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deep Rai","original_name":"Deep Rai","popularity":0.192,"profile_path":"/kRthWAHPI4JEuofbgpIwIc8zOXZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Basketball Player","credit_id":"59091f029251411ce9001445","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Rey Angelus","original_name":"Nick Rey Angelus","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Reynaldo Sanchez","credit_id":"59091f0fc3a36836110012e4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Castelan","original_name":"Raymond Castelan","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gabriel","credit_id":"59091f21c3a3683611001301","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giana Castro","original_name":"Giana Castro","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Angel Hurtado","credit_id":"59091f31c3a36835fc00137a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Whit Ellis","original_name":"Thomas Whit Ellis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sergeant Herbert","credit_id":"59091f429251411cf30014d2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sianna Foster","original_name":"Sianna Foster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Young Girl","credit_id":"59091f4fc3a368359d00169a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna Garabedian","original_name":"Edna Garabedian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Agnes Kalanjian","credit_id":"59091f5bc3a36835fc0013a5","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Tadlock","original_name":"Jennifer Tadlock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59091ecb9251411cef00146a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809132,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Skin Mead","original_name":"Skin Mead","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59091ed5c3a36835c5001465","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2305020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin McAleece","original_name":"Justin McAleece","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5daf65fcecaef500112399f0","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1954442","wikidata_id":"Q5449945","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yv6xevDude8rBacGZnIP6Csg3Lg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":253695,"name":"christian film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
