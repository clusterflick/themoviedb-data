Situated 300 miles from the North Pole, where polar bears outnumber humans, and bearing the distinction of being the northernmost town in the world, Longyearbyen is a community with an unforgiving climate, dreary isolation and an uncertain economic future. Like many small towns, Longyearbyen was once a bustling industrial hub that’s now struggling to find innovative ways to sustain itself. This Cold Life is filmmaker Darren Mann’s visually stunning portrait that illuminates a tight-knit group of colourful and resourceful residents who are dedicated to preserving the land they call home. Through charming individual reflections, including two men who fought to change a law to establish a brewery and become the town’s only export, we experience what it’s like to live in unity for our neighbours’ well-being.","popularity":0.108,"poster_path":"/74ft2ouAs6RrrEI0FParSPtopah.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Cold Life","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3382256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darren Mann","original_name":"Darren Mann","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64455487a06efe0552a59701","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3382256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darren Mann","original_name":"Darren Mann","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64455491a06efe05c4a59b7d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3382256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darren Mann","original_name":"Darren Mann","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64455495d35dea0455fc385f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4024893,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeff Schaum","original_name":"Jeff Schaum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6445549fa06efe059ea5916a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4026450,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eric Thompson","original_name":"Eric Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644685b4b3f6f515559fbe85","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6274718","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g72UulUAJhwSYFwl3741SPbTWmc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rDJjafcjVjdTqRfjNR3UeCMx6Ll.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/74ft2ouAs6RrrEI0FParSPtopah.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
