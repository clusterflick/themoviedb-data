A nod of the head, which seems treacherous in its mechanical repetition, meets the profile of a bearded man who does not appear to react at all in a suggested counter shot. The slight flickering of the image further intensifies the impression of an illicit agreement, of witnessing a crooked handshake. The ringing of the unseen telephone and the constant ticking of a clock lend the events a limited temporality. Something is running out, and in doing so, is also already reaching its end, a ghostly final act, which is anticipated by an explosion and breaks off with the sound of a falling guillotine.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":"/txjTwIRCS9Owt9emfSKYBDsZTSC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89667,"logo_path":null,"name":"TMM Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2017-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hallo Mabuse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dietmar Brehm","original_name":"Dietmar Brehm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zkYe7thFoRbgLnGvB0yN33CAsS6.jpg","credit_id":"5904590992514169d0009bf9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dietmar Brehm","original_name":"Dietmar Brehm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zkYe7thFoRbgLnGvB0yN33CAsS6.jpg","credit_id":"5904592992514169fb00a45d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dietmar Brehm","original_name":"Dietmar Brehm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zkYe7thFoRbgLnGvB0yN33CAsS6.jpg","credit_id":"59045965c3a3684af0009212","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dietmar Brehm","original_name":"Dietmar Brehm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zkYe7thFoRbgLnGvB0yN33CAsS6.jpg","credit_id":"590459199251416a1400a302","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6834896","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/txjTwIRCS9Owt9emfSKYBDsZTSC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Nashville Film Festival","release_date":"2017-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
