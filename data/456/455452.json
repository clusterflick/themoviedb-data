The ruler, however, is more concerned with the sexual activity of her court than the daily business. A horde of Cossacks, led by Pugachev, threatens the country's population. The rebels are raging through the country. Meanwhile, the Czarina in St. Petersburg is enjoying group sex orgies. A lieutenant from Vienna wants to free Russia from this situation and faces the hustle and bustle.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/w1oAIaWSyuqA9RFBsmA8UWPQew.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241,"logo_path":null,"name":"Herzog","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1983-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Katharina, the Sado-Queen","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Katharina und ihre wilden Hengste, Teil 2 - Katharina, die Sadozarin","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Katharina, the Sado-queen","type":"world-wide"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":46539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uschi Karnat","original_name":"Uschi Karnat","popularity":9.442,"profile_path":"/7EdIn0gzV6ZbK1tpuqSyIeiWEEp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Katharina die Große","credit_id":"5be8bf2d92514143f2033238","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":559024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Singh","original_name":"Werner Singh","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Paul / Katharinas Sohn-Catherine's son","credit_id":"5d9cba886d675a0028f3ab77","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":559071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sascha Atzenbeck","original_name":"Sascha Atzenbeck","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/aqcECFtGQOtdj7XIMKBLOYw4KJu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Leutnant","credit_id":"5d9cba95439be1392678f582","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1175251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Chevalier","original_name":"Carmen Chevalier","popularity":3.991,"profile_path":"/w4VNiHXqiz3A7MJd7bQymmJGMSJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d9cbaa46b5fc20029d8883c","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":559017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Atia","original_name":"Sandra Atia","popularity":1.38,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d9cbb8ad388ae00271455ef","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1474130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Paul Blondeau","original_name":"Jean-Paul Blondeau","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d9cbb99d388ae00271455f9","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1473489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Lerique","original_name":"Chris Lerique","popularity":1.329,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d9cbba86d675a4aa8f2b4ba","order":6},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1474135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Tartakovski","original_name":"Vladimir Tartakovski","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5d9cbbb66d675a0033f33ba4","order":7},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":4472107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne Hofer","original_name":"Susanne Hofer","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/TdIWMHhI0DxgbLeyx0Nr7OPYnW.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"659d625d5437f5014b9c5154","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":39751,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Klaus König","original_name":"Klaus König","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be8b64cc3a368174a03149b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0953994","wikidata_id":"Q1561870","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/6mFHe3gOAHM3q122hB90euSNruX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2165,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/w1oAIaWSyuqA9RFBsmA8UWPQew.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1444}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
