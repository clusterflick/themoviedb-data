Un cinema alla riscossa","overview":"The Cinema Mexico is one of the last single-screen cinemas left in Milan. Its story is inextricably tied to the figure of Antonio Sancassani who ran it independently for the past thirty years taking care of every single aspect. At the cinema Mexico he presents independent films, debuts, films in original version, documentaries, forgotten films or films that have been \"burned\" by large-scale distribution offering them a second chance. The thirty-six years of the Rocky Horror Picture Show and two extraordinary years of The Wind Blows Round are only some of the successes that have made of the cinema a reference point for insiders from all over Italy. A passionate portrait that reflects on the fate of small cinemas and on the difficulties for independent cinema that is suffocated by the laws of the market, by online streaming and by the television.","popularity":0.2317,"poster_path":"/em29LgRmhJnAjtVnR4t9Up5yApl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mexico!
