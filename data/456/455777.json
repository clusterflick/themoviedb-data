Attempting to sabotage the proposed annexation of the territory, desperado Bart Dawson (Stephen Keyes) and his men ambush Sunset and his young trainee Jed (Al Terry). The villains, who have been terrorizing pretty trading post operator Helen Bennett (Patricia Starling), are eventually defeated by the rangers in a violent gun battle and the planned annexation takes place on schedule. For all intents and purposes, the handsome but wooden Sunset Carson ended his screen career with this series of extremely low-budget Westerns, originally filmed in 16mm and released by that dumping ground of Poverty Row flotsam, Astor Pictures.","popularity":0.5207,"poster_path":"/fVWkC2uOSx6Z5RIWbrJ1XG3jnHB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13738,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astor Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":10737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yucca Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"BLAZING SIX- GUNS SEEK REVENGE!","title":"Fighting Mustang","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":256047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sunset Carson","original_name":"Sunset Carson","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":"/7btFVs6SaJMyo16BLoQP1enrDnA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sunset Carson","credit_id":"5909dd9c9251411ce400df0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1096504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Terry","original_name":"Al Terry","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jed Thomas","credit_id":"5909dda9c3a368357e00f102","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1096505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Starling","original_name":"Pat Starling","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Helen Bennett (as Patricia Starling)","credit_id":"5909ddb69251411cd900e3ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311618,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Polly McKay","original_name":"Polly McKay","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rita Bennett","credit_id":"5909ddc49251411ce400df48","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Val","original_name":"William Val","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Tim Bennett","credit_id":"5909ddd49251411cd900e414","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1756961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felice Richmond","original_name":"Felice Richmond","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Aunt Therese (as Felese Richmond)","credit_id":"5909dde89251411cd900e42c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":193583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Curtis","original_name":"Bob Curtis","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Kelly","credit_id":"5909ddf2c3a368361100cf63","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1096506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Keyes","original_name":"Stephen Keyes","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Bart Dawson","credit_id":"5909de00c3a36835ee00e490","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1106946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Hiser","original_name":"Joe Hiser","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Shorty","credit_id":"5909de0c9251411ce400df9b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Forrest Matthews","original_name":"Forrest Matthews","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Captain J.
