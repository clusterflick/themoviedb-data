As we hear the dreams they hope the sea will make reality, and the real lives they have left behind at home, the romance of the sea gives way to the isolation and dislocation of life far away from families and imagined futures. Just when the film threatens to slip into melancholy, Lamarche offers us moments of irony and humour to lighten the mood. The unadulterated kitsch of songs like Baccaraâ€™s Ay Ay Sailor help lift the spirits of the crew, and the film. Perhaps this is how one survives adrift in a floating prison, where even the birds are trapped!","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Far Awar Lands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
