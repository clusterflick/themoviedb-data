His contribution as an interdisciplinary composer, educator, and founding member of Western Front, though undoubtedly extensive, is in danger of being erased from cultural memory since his death from AIDS in 1993.  Navigating an array of archival materials including letters, correspondences, notebooks, personal photos, and a huge body of unreleased music and field recordings held at the archives of Simon Fraser University, Electro-Pythagoras is a journey through the evolution of Bartlett’s musical time and space, softly guided by Luke Fowler’s insightful camera and montage—creating an experimental portrait that defies one-dimensionality.","popularity":0.1943,"poster_path":"/hbkFUBza3fgbpHVv9GIQs31yfkD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam","origin_country":""},{"id":137235,"logo_path":null,"name":"Western Front","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Electro-Pythagorus: A Portrait of Martin Bartlett","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1806557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Bartlett","original_name":"Martin Bartlett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"himself","credit_id":"59042f0392514169c800818b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Fowler","original_name":"Luke Fowler","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/5cu30pcHXQAfgmmdGg1O49sNxEH.jpg","credit_id":"59042f28c3a3684ad7007dda","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Fowler","original_name":"Luke Fowler","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/5cu30pcHXQAfgmmdGg1O49sNxEH.jpg","credit_id":"59042f1592514169b8007f5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Fowler","original_name":"Luke Fowler","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/5cu30pcHXQAfgmmdGg1O49sNxEH.jpg","credit_id":"5f0f7b6cafe2240034e0bfd9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1444711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernst Karel","original_name":"Ernst Karel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0f7d321da7a6003615f1a2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7658374","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xOoP9CZB7zURnfNPM0Iep2H3lnR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1413,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hbkFUBza3fgbpHVv9GIQs31yfkD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":942}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":208111,"name":"electroacoustics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ELECTRO PYTHAGORUS (A PORTRAIT OF MARTIN BARTLETT)- Luke Fowler","key":"7QTX_pYZfzM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-10-18T01:38:58.000Z","id":"63d7896920e6a5007b01baf9"}]}}}
