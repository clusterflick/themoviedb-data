Instead, he does the next best thing.  He meets the devil in a boiler room. And the devil’s a she. A very sexy she named Lucibel sans the traditional horns and pointy tail because \"that’s terribly passé, today its mod.\" Touched that Marvin is such a screw-up, she offers to help him but not, she says, because she wants his soul, but because she wants to make him happy. So she grants him a wish with no strings attached.","popularity":0.3846,"poster_path":"/knCl6heGC8gDl22cIwYKCT2nMsj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43459,"logo_path":null,"name":"August Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Hex with Sex","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":549476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Boyce","original_name":"Linda Boyce","popularity":0.2839,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"590b2f019251414fa10152d5","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":590121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Hunter","original_name":"Larry Hunter","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/iLyGEi2SneIIjyRQgcBuXE6NAds.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"590b2f0b9251414fa10152df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Shaw","original_name":"Paula Shaw","popularity":0.3737,"profile_path":"/xngscmuXRXhEjGnYhsHG1zHhUrM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lucibel","credit_id":"590b2f289251414fbe0141f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1768963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynn Milgrim","original_name":"Lynn Milgrim","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5da1f663a13533000f2ffbe7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Peters","original_name":"Stefan Peters","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Marvin Swift","credit_id":"67e91bec700a6a94c6e54b15","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":128594,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Nuchtern","original_name":"Simon Nuchtern","popularity":0.1367,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590b2ee0c3a36843c8014cc5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":128594,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Nuchtern","original_name":"Simon Nuchtern","popularity":0.1367,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e91bfc2cca6fc8fbc6ad11","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":128594,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Nuchtern","original_name":"Simon Nuchtern","popularity":0.1367,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e91c05a98dc813b0f6cfb2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4152924,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Riva Freifeld","original_name":"Riva Freifeld","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e91c102cca6fc8fbc6ad19","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1498458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sidney Knight","original_name":"Sidney Knight","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e91c262cca6fc8fbc6ad23","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0248559","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1839,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/knCl6heGC8gDl22cIwYKCT2nMsj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1225},{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iUMKPTtq4qbbu5TXIo0TMozw82C.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1007}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
