The camera chases improbable incidents across the screen. Many are constructed out of one of Jordan's favorite engravings illustrators: Poyet. Duels occur on a tight rope. Heavier-than- air machines fly (and sometimes crash). Below guns spear exploding spheres. The timing of the animation is exquisite, existing in an atmosphere balanced between frenzy and delight.","popularity":0.1828,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chateau/Poyet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":267634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Jordan","original_name":"Lawrence Jordan","popularity":0.2613,"profile_path":"/nELFCK1hpF0pmhRSQy9EdWrVG6R.jpg","credit_id":"57f5d5adc3a3681604002dbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2189780","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"},{"id":7507,"name":"collage"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Onion City Experimental Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2004-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
