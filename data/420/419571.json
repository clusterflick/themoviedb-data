Among them is Baron van Waldheim, who, before he dies of exhaustion, entrusts his little son Alfred to the care of his butler Hendrik. The evil Jan van Oort persuades Hendrik to give him the Baron's papers. When they put the boy ashore, he wounds himself on a nail (leaving a scar that will later prove his identity). For years Van Oort manages to pass himself off as Baron van Waldheim; he is married and has a daughter and a son. One day Hendrik turns up demanding a job as butler, swearing that otherwise he will betray Van Oort's secret. Meanwhile, Alfred - now an adult known as Ulbo Garvema - has become a teacher. Unaware of who Van Oort really is, he accepts the position of tutor to Van Oort's children. He falls in love with the daughter, but Van Oort refuses to give his consent to their marriage. Ulbo and the girl elope.","popularity":0.1818,"poster_path":"/6smTMZDnSrQRw1oIKOfQe8ARDyN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102429,"logo_path":"/9n6WQxDFeqMZJMVDXNiVhQvvlke.png","name":"Filmfabriek-Hollandia","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1917-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ulbo Garvema","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"In rechten hersteld","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Vogeding","original_name":"Frederick Vogeding","popularity":0.0832,"profile_path":"/td9no6RZcb1cGsMvg2RT4s5Y3IS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Baron van Walden / Alfred","credit_id":"57f5373e9251413f1f000860","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cor Smits","original_name":"Cor Smits","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jan van Oort","credit_id":"57f53751c3a3687c940007dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1386605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Bos","original_name":"Annie Bos","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/6uab6h6wi9UpEJRtuV9hgWZxRaF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jan van Oort's dochter / Jonge Anna","credit_id":"57f53766c3a3687c6f0007d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan van Dommelen","original_name":"Jan van Dommelen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/3lyTsTFyQ7Pf2RN3xwTQ1wmOc1X.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hendrik","credit_id":"57f537809251413f1f00087c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Homann","original_name":"Fred Homann","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/2Np2K8PkF8VWuaaNhQZc5T63FXW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dokter","credit_id":"67a675a689f05e1619f0f2ac","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3933047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Perin","original_name":"Pierre Perin","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Graaf","credit_id":"67a675af31001bec13c88f56","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5232253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antoinette Sohns","original_name":"Antoinette Sohns","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Gravin","credit_id":"67a675c1e4bd02e64ce04a43","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula de Waart","original_name":"Paula de Waart","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Grootmoeder / Barones","credit_id":"67a675d2bf0a9f6f54e0499f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Winar","original_name":"Ernst Winar","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/7HJAfUpwzAGoG8uZwJlsupy5i6j.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"67a675d7ad2758bac5f0f20d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1151421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Bouwmeester","original_name":"Lily Bouwmeester","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":"/sLkHcZLDDJ1GXFNknmLKNdt6ZWL.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Erna","credit_id":"67a675e4ad2758bac5f0f21f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lola Cornero","original_name":"Lola Cornero","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Dienstmeisje","credit_id":"67a675ef58d93cefedc88f8f","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurits Binger","original_name":"Maurits Binger","popularity":0.2281,"profile_path":"/zezJ7MThJvRtENsmCKZcrXsUpvM.jpg","credit_id":"57f5368ac3a3687c71000722","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2666424,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ernest Scheidius","original_name":"Ernest Scheidius","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed9d1aeb3f6f5002197736d","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurits Binger","original_name":"Maurits Binger","popularity":0.2281,"profile_path":"/zezJ7MThJvRtENsmCKZcrXsUpvM.jpg","credit_id":"67a6756b58d93cefedc88f4f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176535,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jan Smit","original_name":"Jan Smit","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6758489f05e1619f0f297","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747762,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"H.W.
