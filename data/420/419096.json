Their goals are unknown, and they cast a dark shadow over the world. Though few people believe in the Bresdo's existence, one American journalist named Lucie Davenport heads to Texas to contact a certain family, and she meets the cyborgs. The cyborgs themselves have been freed from their duty of protecting humanity ever since the establishment of the UN Guardian troops, and they now live quiet lives of peace.","popularity":0.4721,"poster_path":"/l3opwdUuC2oBUktefm42G5EsCBb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cyborg 009: Call of Justice 2","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenji Kamiyama","original_name":"神山健治","popularity":0.6693,"profile_path":"/1irWT1aUVYdeoZCtnxNVS9wfrks.jpg","credit_id":"57f12dabc3a3683f2700d732","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2477647,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"saitom","original_name":"saitom","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676387480e9dc3282caaf932","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Character Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553254,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shotaro Ishinomori","original_name":"石ノ森章太郎","popularity":1.1636,"profile_path":"/6GGRm4pvMOqSWfqhv06WJJhn6s4.jpg","credit_id":"676387911c346ed1bd0007d4","department":"Art","job":"Original Series Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553254,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shotaro Ishinomori","original_name":"石ノ森章太郎","popularity":1.1636,"profile_path":"/6GGRm4pvMOqSWfqhv06WJJhn6s4.jpg","credit_id":"6763879d0e9dc3282caaf976","department":"Writing","job":"Comic Book"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5894274","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l3opwdUuC2oBUktefm42G5EsCBb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":210024,"name":"anime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
