However, that would be a far too simplistic reading of the multiple thematic elements that tie together the narrative of 'Doctor'. The idea of caste based discrimination, violence and upper-caste hypocrisy is placed alongside the notions of generational conflict in a father-son relationship and the idea of a ever-widening generation gap especially in the historical and socio-political context of the film.","popularity":0.0758,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1940-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1660069,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pankaj Mullick","original_name":"Pankaj Mullick","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":"/aGASKnYFRg3jdzXtgDBswPsrQR0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Amar Nath","credit_id":"57f6c5afc3a36862fd0000a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1690382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahindra Choudhury","original_name":"Ahindra Choudhury","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":"/3rqIKd89pAg1fNhBNV5hxVzjQ7A.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Seeta Nath","credit_id":"57f6c5e8c3a368630c000084","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1690383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jyoti Prakash","original_name":"Jyoti Prakash","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Somnath","credit_id":"57f6c5fac3a36862fa0000b3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phani Majumdar","original_name":"Phani Majumdar","popularity":0.1274,"profile_path":"/20yIbQlIpUouR0fEJtIH0JTpPex.jpg","credit_id":"57f6c225c3a3681065000c38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1690381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Subodh Mitra","original_name":"Subodh Mitra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f6c235c3a3681065000c3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0236161","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1940-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
