Earl is a simple man with a simple desire--to marry Pam, the only available girl in town. But she'll only give herself to a man who meets her strict criteria, including trailer-home ownership. And Earl's conniving boss at the meat-packing plant will do anything to win Pam's heart first. Buddy, on the other hand, wrongly fancies himself a master criminal, scheming big and failing big while avoiding both legitimate employment and his heartless parole officer. When Buddy hatches a brainless scheme to kidnap a corrupt U.S. Congressman for ransom.","popularity":0.7114,"poster_path":"/rkhMLISuaWj7dHuCdOd1FCIMSXT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When it comes to kidnapping these guys stink","title":"Bad Meat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chevy Chase","original_name":"Chevy Chase","popularity":1.9039,"profile_path":"/A1X2BvR8vEXvwXdJa5uYAYVCO2k.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Congressman Bernard P.
