While in Washington, DC, she meets and falls in love with a British army officer, Capt. Fraser. While traveling by ship to France with her father, she meets Count von Schulling, a German diplomat who is an acquaintance of her father. Von Schulling falls for the pretty young Adele. While in France, Adele organizes a rescue party to save Capt. Fraser, who has been on a secret mission behind enemy lines and has been wounded. In a twist of fate, Adele finds the wounded Fraser and takes him to a hospital, but Count von Schuling, who has also been wounded, is placed in the same room as Fraser. When the hospital is overrun by German forces, Adele is placed in a delicate position by von Sculling: either spy for the Germans or Fraser will be shot.","popularity":0.1999,"poster_path":"/yqWbSJpgGe6cXR4jEUpYZp1UKBh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38283,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Picture Theatres of America Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adele","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1564768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kitty Gordon","original_name":"Kitty Gordon","popularity":0.1312,"profile_path":"/mCGo2WBsMipXY64hkuq32FeMjwk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Adele Bleneau","credit_id":"57f55165c3a36831c30007c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahlon Hamilton","original_name":"Mahlon Hamilton","popularity":0.2635,"profile_path":"/jC8MQCyxxXSrNNyW7AvDGtu1GVI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Capt.
