The owner, O'Rourke, whom Jimmy believes to be his friend, sends one of his men to their table to inquire about Georgia, and after he shoots the policeman, Georgia and Jimmy are held for questioning. As a result, Georgia is turned out of her home, and O'Rourke gives the couple a room in his hotel. Assistant District Attorney Steven Graham links the missing couple with O'Rourke's activities and collects evidence against him. O'Rourke plans to bribe Graham and have Jimmy shot on the night of his annual ball, and Sally, O'Rourke's ex-mistress, learning of the plan, turns against him and informs Georgia; finding Jimmy wounded, Georgia seeks revenge at the ball, but Sally shoots O'Rourke. Georgia is reunited with her family and Jimmy, while Graham finds happiness with her sister Mary. It is considered to be a lost film.","popularity":0.2151,"poster_path":"/tIJcBFKrjbC5YpkjKUduzW6r8fw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldwyn Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voices of the City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Night Rose","type":"Original title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leatrice Joy","original_name":"Leatrice Joy","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":"/mUrizNrPg9AfitR1kQLQnKdxEAT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Georgia Rodman","credit_id":"57f5c8ee925141360300292b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lon Chaney","original_name":"Lon Chaney","popularity":0.3652,"profile_path":"/m1icBooBEqFNp24Puu7qXn2Sarr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"O'Rourke","credit_id":"57f5c8f9c3a3681625002963","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bowers","original_name":"John Bowers","popularity":0.0933,"profile_path":"/j6KhoMBcaddOHhyuHjXIUxAyjzP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Graham","credit_id":"57f5c900c3a36816100027ee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1023282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cullen Landis","original_name":"Cullen Landis","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/zxYStYMxWtkGNWzfF9JPtMNMhtn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jimmy","credit_id":"57f5c9089251413610002ab3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Tucker","original_name":"Richard Tucker","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/hMHZdVgcSOyhONnAbXNVSKHDwhh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Clancy","credit_id":"57f5c912925141360500298c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1351510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Warren","original_name":"Mary Warren","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/zsujqK0DLQ48y3T1L96Ett76gQ2.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mary Rodman","credit_id":"57f5c9399251413605002994","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1006951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edythe Chapman","original_name":"Edythe Chapman","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/c7wjWOh91mvlINvAm5CazBbUbah.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Rodman","credit_id":"57f5c946925141360300294f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1321570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Schade","original_name":"Betty Schade","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":"/I4bTrOHFcjvlcsP26Xft4XGFeK.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sally","credit_id":"57f5c94f925141360500299b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1334993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice 'Lefty' Flynn","original_name":"Maurice 'Lefty' Flynn","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/n156oXZhoxpx8suqWJzBwCdTWFD.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Pierson (as Maurice B.
