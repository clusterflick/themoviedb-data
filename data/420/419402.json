Scientists believe they've pinpointed a cause for the loss of many of the amphibians: the chytrid fungus, which flourishes in high altitudes. Unfortunately, they don't know how to combat it. Included: an isolated forest in Panama that has yet to be touched by the fungus, thus enabling frogs to live and thrive as they have for eons.","popularity":0.7595,"poster_path":"/ehImHwLK2UCfiicFTJy4S20uc0U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frogs: The Thin Green Line","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1358729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allison Argo","original_name":"Allison Argo","popularity":0.1621,"profile_path":"/d8k9OwBODF8MhSDfMYtsazpVzrD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"57f4460d925141398a0019e7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689233,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Indrani Datta","original_name":"Indrani Datta","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f4407f92514138f00017bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689240,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel B.
