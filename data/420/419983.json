The settlers were drawn up in a long line at a certain distance from the lands opened up, some of them on horseback and others in vehicles of all descriptions. At the firing of a cannon, everybody made a rush for the land. Harvey Mattson and his wife Annie, with their child, emigrate form Missouri in a prairie schooner. On their way they hear of the opening up of the Cherokee Strip. They hasten there and Harvey pitches camp, preparatory to entering his name. Their child is taken sick. Harvey goes for the doctor, and during his absence. Bill Slick, a good-looking ruffian, tries to force his attentions upon Annie. She repulses him. Harvey and the doctor arrive, and he \"settles\" Bill without ceremony. The ruffian, enraged, leaves.","popularity":0.1526,"poster_path":"/sstkSqRhNQf0rq79QmOCoSWK0qt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How States Are Made","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Burns","original_name":"Fred Burns","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":"/xzoiQBucdaeyP7YSQ9csyq43LBP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Harvey Mattson - a Pioneer","credit_id":"57f803cec3a3682608003fea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Schaefer","original_name":"Anne Schaefer","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/9qRdeDOGNal4hgTZhWJ7OhLwMvG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Annie Mattson - Harvey's Wife","credit_id":"57f803e192514116a2000e48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Thornby","original_name":"Robert Thornby","popularity":0.1941,"profile_path":"/dNxou1Tn7Yhm1Rk1oxx8JGC5iBi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bill Slick - a Roving Vagabond","credit_id":"57f803f092514175e100415c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Bennett","original_name":"Charles Bennett","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":"/sfcmmw6e1Ee8penS6IGUihuZKWa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"A Pioneer","credit_id":"57f80400c3a36874fe000cce","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rollin S.
