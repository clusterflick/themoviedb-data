While she tends to every chore on the docket, we learn some things about her. She has a green thumb, she speaks Polish while on the phone, she likes to nap. A prayer sounds. They are words from her mother-in-law, Polish poet Zofia Bohdanowiczowa, who was also displaced from her native Poland. Three generations meet, one by writing, one by living, and the third by the very making of this film, a composition of her ancestors through sound and image.","popularity":0.0709,"poster_path":"/98Uh7QNkvTU6Jjf2OmdQEvhGc09.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Prayer","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Bohdanowicz","original_name":"Maria Bohdanowicz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5b8165d00e0a26458f0108f7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1688651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofia Bohdanowicz","original_name":"Sofia Bohdanowicz","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/z7SXORpBTrGfSiD5ZCaI5HlhgOw.jpg","credit_id":"57f4b5269251411c7e002a3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144089,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Calvin Thomas","original_name":"Calvin Thomas","popularity":0.1302,"profile_path":"/BO1zMKEcHeqzChIRar5neaMKyf.jpg","credit_id":"5de3aab23faba000190d0e59","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679079,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aaron Mirkin","original_name":"Aaron Mirkin","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de3aaeca7e36300196ae2f3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2733808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2083,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/98Uh7QNkvTU6Jjf2OmdQEvhGc09.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1389},{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":1314,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/flcmNdSLntKhLolLRQRluj8Z7wk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Toronto","release_date":"2014-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
