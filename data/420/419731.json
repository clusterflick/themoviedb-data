That dream came to an abrupt end when Sam crashed into a wall at 200 miles per hour, leaving him a quadriplegic. Reengineering SAM pulls the curtain back and shows up close the serious implications of a life of paralysis on Sam and everyone around him. Sam's accident rendered him physically helpless, never being able to brush his teeth, much less drive again, until a dedicated group of some of the brightest minds today stepped up to build him a car that he could drive, using only his head. Through groundbreaking adaptive technologies, Reengineering SAM chronicles Sam Schmidt's inspirational road back to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and shows the promise of freedom and mobility for almost anyone confined to a wheelchair.","popularity":0.7504,"poster_path":"/prUSe2pgfElez1aQolhZibAyaVZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123578,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fast Forward Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reengineering SAM","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Schmidt","original_name":"Sam Schmidt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d9216ce7f4f210010df80b3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422126,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paul Trantow","original_name":"Paul Trantow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9217ff8e8702002905af08","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Manley","original_name":"Jake Manley","popularity":0.4888,"profile_path":"/mu8otJW0iA89jqF7SVe59ccrfAI.jpg","credit_id":"5d9217d2d4a68b0029a9a3ef","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Malone","original_name":"Brian Malone","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9216e8e1ad7900105915ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1511484,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lyman Smith","original_name":"Lyman Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d92183c8e8702001905d23a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1625947,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diana Holtzberg","original_name":"Diana Holtzberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d92176f7f4f210018df8988","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Malone","original_name":"Brian Malone","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9217bcd4a68b000fa9ab49","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":198037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cindy Malone","original_name":"Cindy Malone","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d92179ee1ad790021591e2c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Malone","original_name":"Brian Malone","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d92182dd4a68b000fa9b09b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Junge","original_name":"Daniel Junge","popularity":0.0525,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d92178c39a1a600271f4569","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4770770","wikidata_id":"Q27042023","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":2216,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/prUSe2pgfElez1aQolhZibAyaVZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9571,"name":"motor sport"},{"id":10039,"name":"racing"},{"id":33618,"name":"machine"},{"id":162735,"name":"disability"},{"id":184343,"name":"quadriplegic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Reengineering Sam Trailer","key":"xUXtKxBs5r0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-08-31T15:25:15.000Z","id":"5d9219348e8702002905b307"}]}}}
