Based on Weil's bestseller Healthy Aging: A Guide to Your Physical and Spiritual Well-Being, the program consists of Weil discussing his principles, on-camera, as they involve making a smoother transition to advanced age in contemporary society.

The internist then provides a myriad of suggestions aimed at 60+ viewers who wish to dramatically extend their lives and improve the condition of their lives - from dietary considerations to exercise and meditation. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5177,"logo_path":null,"name":"Acacia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A guide to achieving lifelong health and happiness from America's most trusted physician","title":"Dr. Andrew Weil's Healthy Aging","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dr. Andrew Weil: Healthy Aging","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Weil","original_name":"Andrew Weil","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/7NPweF6LoGAZRw2v6mvVGbvZh1F.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57f31068c3a368334c004480","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17346450","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
