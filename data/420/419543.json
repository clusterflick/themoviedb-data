Most American Jews live in large cities where they are free to define themselves in any way they wish. But almost invisible to most of the country are roughly one million Jews scattered across far-flung communities. For them, Jewish identity is a daily urgent challenge; if they donâ€™t personally uphold their communities and live affirmative Jewish lives, they and their legacies could fade away forever.","popularity":0.1889,"poster_path":"/dB709SEC5b2bvLRXifXbPcaAfpf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82082,"logo_path":null,"name":"371
