Granger presents his new wife at an engagement party given for his sister Jane, but Jane's fiance, Lord Cecil Graydon, threatens to break off the betrothal unless Granger's marriage is annulled. To please his sister, Granger sacrifices Margery, who seeks work and later gives birth to a child. Following the baby's death, Margery goes West, where she befriends an old miner who later leaves her his fortune. Meanwhile, Granger becomes involved in a fraudulent mining deal, and because of George Osborne's perjured testimony, he is sent to prison for five years. When he escapes, Margery agrees to hide him and is ultimately responsible for obtaining his pardon. Granger then remarries the wife he once abandoned.","popularity":0.3776,"poster_path":"/iSk0XAfcqOoqEGEsv5YdIlkp1AH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72476,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paralta Plays Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wedlock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Glaum","original_name":"Louise Glaum","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/qwin2PB7Qzxxe2FQE58tJnmQOdM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maargery Harding","credit_id":"57f53fa9c3a3687c94000b02","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gilbert","original_name":"John Gilbert","popularity":0.5269,"profile_path":"/wibrEasDmipryIht6W6ajxAAQgH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Granger Hollister (as Jack Gilbert)","credit_id":"57f53fb49251413f1c000b2e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herschel Mayall","original_name":"Herschel Mayall","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":"/r4dM7lkjleHm2TsTaIGwkZoSEB6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"George Osborne","credit_id":"57f53fca9251413f2c000b65","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Gunn","original_name":"Charles Gunn","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":"/4eQXdUj3Qz7weEbevE5NbmQgxIe.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Reverend Grover King","credit_id":"57f53fd3c3a3687c6f000b01","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph J.
