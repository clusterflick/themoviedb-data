The traveller has understood that \"everywhere it is difficult to live\" and tries to make a picture from real things, so that, through the act of painting, he no longer suffers. Inspired by the characters in SÃ´seki's novel \"Pillow of Herbs\", these references give a free interpretation to the images, so that we make the journey in search of temporary solace.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Floating Bodies","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Cahen","original_name":"Robert Cahen","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/FmOZh0dH1DeEDbja7brcmZxQgO.jpg","credit_id":"57f070f592514141ee00c596","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
