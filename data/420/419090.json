But at the same time, a cardinal arrives, and the truth must be kept from him. Nénette passes for Hubert's wife, and the cardinal spends his time reconciling the pseudo-spouses. After many misunderstandings, Hubert and Nénette discover that they love each other, while Jules marries the pretty soubrette, not without first inoculating Hubert's virtuous aunt with his taste for racing.","popularity":0.2047,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1954-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J'y suis... j'y reste","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":535159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Pierry","original_name":"Marguerite Pierry","popularity":0.2522,"profile_path":"/jeCbaRKrn8Xmf1qi9fW0LlR5kpP.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"La Comtesse Apolline de Mont-Vermeil","credit_id":"57f12742c3a368593c0020e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":244449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Sourza","original_name":"Jane Sourza","popularity":0.1181,"profile_path":"/5ASeUuiy123CBSvzgI8XTV5Y3I7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Antoinette Mercier","credit_id":"57f1275ac3a3683ea900a99b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":275196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Pizani","original_name":"Robert Pizani","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":"/7nltKsPYIYvwfUdro8ueLTbFz6s.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Le Cardinal de Tramone","credit_id":"57f1277c9251416d9c003f1c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeannette Batti","original_name":"Jeannette Batti","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":"/qxLhY55aJHHOiuanLeyz32JPqTR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lucie","credit_id":"57f127909251416d31003faa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1054255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roméo Carlès","original_name":"Roméo Carlès","popularity":0.0951,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Patrice","credit_id":"57f127a3c3a368599400200c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1688092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Stéphen","original_name":"Pierre Stéphen","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Baron Hubert du Mont-Vermeil","credit_id":"57f127b9c3a3683f2700d3fa","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":633337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arlette Merry","original_name":"Arlette Merry","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/6VQCX7j3aGDwVEpTOOshskFemGa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gisèle","credit_id":"57f127cd9251416d31003fce","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Dinan","original_name":"Albert Dinan","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":"/fcfU20fCuaYCp8wrjQbmRuQ2DLe.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jules","credit_id":"57f127db9251415be0002107","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice Labro","original_name":"Maurice Labro","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6fdc59af171017b58f2e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Boissol","original_name":"Claude Boissol","popularity":0.0842,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6fdaee6d3cc0148bfcd2e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice Labro","original_name":"Maurice Labro","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be8768692514143e202ae1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0157840","wikidata_id":"Q19365628","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1954-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
