In the dead of the night, a burglar enters the Lyttell home. His silent footsteps reach the ear of the sick man. Clara, too, hears mysterious noises. She pacifies Daniel and tells him to rest and sleep. Softly she steals out of the room to investigate and soon discovers the burglar. Quickly rushes to the telephone, but finds that the wires have been cut. For a moment she hesitates and fears, fears for her husband. Goes to his bedside and rejoices to find him asleep. Hastily dons a wrap and envelops her head in a black veil, leaves the room and busies herself rummaging in the drawers of a desk. The burglar comes upon her but is unable to intimidate the brave little woman. Clara tells him she, too, is a thief; only she came to steal very important letters. When the man attempts to go into the bedroom for his \"haul,\" she commands him to stay where he is.","popularity":0.0843,"poster_path":"/hchxCTEFIch7pVBSSJ8YVzDZqc6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nestor Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Brave Little Woman","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Brave Little Lady","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Lockwood","original_name":"Harold Lockwood","popularity":0.0678,"profile_path":"/uyqlRj6IXQv1oX5pDJKKCgNSjMP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Burglar","credit_id":"57f771b9c3a3683ae4000f29","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Davenport","original_name":"Dorothy Davenport","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/mS2sibbJ4046yDGmocE43LRWeil.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Clara Lyttell","credit_id":"57f771cac3a3683b6f0011e0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Ricketts","original_name":"Tom Ricketts","popularity":0.1217,"profile_path":"/66ezBnrNzoiL82VNBjo6NTAYHns.jpg","credit_id":"61f880a76dc5073bdec4aeb2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Ricketts","original_name":"Tom Ricketts","popularity":0.1217,"profile_path":"/66ezBnrNzoiL82VNBjo6NTAYHns.jpg","credit_id":"57f7718fc3a3683b6f0011cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0002071","wikidata_id":"Q15630042","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uQvDN04FyWR90rXVHMYaNXmwuZc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":806,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hchxCTEFIch7pVBSSJ8YVzDZqc6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":537}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
