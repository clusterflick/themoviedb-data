McDowell was dying from AIDS-related illnesses during the production of the diary.  “An elegy for McDowell, the videowork captures Kuchar’s mournful remembrances of his long-lasting friendship with the young filmmaker. But it also has the inquisitive charm, perverse humor, and quirky candor that places Kuchar’s visual expressions in a gritty niche all their own.”","popularity":0.4512,"poster_path":"/sg7Uhy0BuqeQooKlpvQ7VsbJHnq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video Album 5: The Thursday People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57f1dac7925141211a000a81","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Kuchar","original_name":"Mike Kuchar","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":"/lw5oEJtwfHwxEV6zfeE05EMqeB7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57f1dace92514146a800311d","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1069726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Curt McDowell","original_name":"Curt McDowell","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/iUoR8uDygPMamkOcQRZbyzjtm10.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c723a190e0a262c1f7cd589","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1070424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Ellinger","original_name":"Mark Ellinger","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/qhB4e1fTEDcbM058pqSm0ZdrVfx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c723a210e0a262c0f7d1331","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1070431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melinda McDowell","original_name":"Melinda McDowell","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c723a299251415ee2b26504","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Gottheim","original_name":"Larry Gottheim","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/y6YJWdMk6006kMVK1CwZXWtD713.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66a592663ca1788293b8bb4f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","credit_id":"57f1dabc925141464500316a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4900252","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sg7Uhy0BuqeQooKlpvQ7VsbJHnq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":221021,"name":"diary film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
