That is, images intended as photography, and therefore as still images. My inclination is to animate [still images] at the very limit of technical impossibility. Scanning these rolls of figures in a state of agitation, shooting one frame at a time, I wanted to extract a film from what was not a film, where frames precisely do not exist and where the process of hand-cranking exposures was indeed equivalent to that of a movie camera, without, however, being a movie camera. Of interest to me was the collision among images dispossessed of sequence, to which the possibility of motion had been given, a motion towards a kinetic narrative, no longer a photographic one, which narrates the end of the images themselves.\" Paolo Gioli","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il finish delle figure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paolo Gioli","original_name":"Paolo Gioli","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/mA2Q0SwP0Wk56hRNNCQDeKNSFdE.jpg","credit_id":"57f07e1fc3a3683c880082c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9707828","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
