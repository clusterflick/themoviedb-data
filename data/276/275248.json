The film records a broad cross-section of candidates who, without an extended media network at their disposal, rely on relentless campaigning, ingenuity and personal charisma to attract votes. Emphasising the divide between coastal people and highlanders, Ileksen looks at the election campaign, election day and the political manouvering that goes with the formation of a government.","popularity":0.1285,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":217069,"logo_path":null,"name":"Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission","origin_country":"PG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PG","name":"Papua New Guinea"}],"release_date":"1978-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Maori","iso_639_1":"mi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ileksen: Politics in Papua New Guinea","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julius Chan","original_name":"Julius Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - P.P.P.
