Marie's parents favor the match, as they prefer Tommy over Bernard Norton, another suitor. Her father, Warren Thurber, however, is in financial straits and plans to sell land to a civic improvement association headed by David Tuttle. When he discovers that Tommy has agreed to sell his land to Mrs. Oberlander, he berates him; but Tommy agrees to boost the price so that Thurber will win out. Tuttle, who favors Bernard as Marie's husband, persuades Tommy that he must endure the displeasure of the Thurbers, and as a result a misunderstanding arises over the sale of the land. But Tuttle's scheme backfires, and Tommy wins the girl after all.","popularity":0.2064,"poster_path":"/qJ3fPylTEqkMtpJD7s8HGEkic2f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She's My Weakness","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Lake","original_name":"Arthur Lake","popularity":0.3042,"profile_path":"/iLu6YQ9dvi6IzLLrAeHiLViewDr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tommy Mills","credit_id":"539773140e0a266db700a3fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1110954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sue Carol","original_name":"Sue Carol","popularity":0.2229,"profile_path":"/p8xbZH7XicN9sZNu3aEmGsqBpAh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Miss Marie Thurber","credit_id":"539773210e0a266db400a4cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Collier Sr.","original_name":"William Collier Sr.","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/8DxgsLlI5TBd9M7EU7SotLKGAFn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"David Tuttle","credit_id":"5397732a0e0a266db700a401","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Littlefield","original_name":"Lucien Littlefield","popularity":0.1619,"profile_path":"/65jnSJmU2BC4Jrpg2Nfg6glU6wN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Warren Thurber","credit_id":"539773380e0a266dc500a09b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1018979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Ware","original_name":"Helen Ware","popularity":0.1829,"profile_path":"/5yuzfIacdR24uKY6274odMQ2CyA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Elise Thurber","credit_id":"53977344c3a368641d006644","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Bunce","original_name":"Alan Bunce","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/m2vSSquZJdROWFwTdgKdrrqWoBG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bernard Norton","credit_id":"5397734dc3a3686423006678","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Fitzroy","original_name":"Emily Fitzroy","popularity":0.2089,"profile_path":"/4V6A5auvNlrXcVPFdua8MfiC2ms.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Oberlander","credit_id":"53977356c3a36864150064d9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Gilbert","original_name":"Walter Gilbert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Wilson","credit_id":"53977360c3a368641d00665c","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melville W.
