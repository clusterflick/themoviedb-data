For the first time, he used 35mm black and white film (a gift from artist Yang Fudong) to capture this landscape condemned to disappear. With no sound, the film records the final, barely visible traces of human lives: bones, clothing, footsteps... Drawing on experimental documentary, this short video echoes other subjects dear to Wang Bing : the story of the campaign against the « rightist elements » in the early 1950s and the reeducation and hard labour camps established before the Cultural Revolution. This film, which was not edited until 2014, was first presented at the Centre Pompidou the same year and then again at the Galerie Chantal Crousel in 2018.","popularity":0.1465,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2014-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Traces","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"YIZHI","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Bing","original_name":"王兵","popularity":0.733,"profile_path":"/h7VnG6T1HYSBBOAuhy7tYAtawO6.jpg","credit_id":"53985a010e0a266dbf00cd0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Bing","original_name":"王兵","popularity":0.733,"profile_path":"/h7VnG6T1HYSBBOAuhy7tYAtawO6.jpg","credit_id":"646d8176a5046e01474eea75","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Bing","original_name":"王兵","popularity":0.733,"profile_path":"/h7VnG6T1HYSBBOAuhy7tYAtawO6.jpg","credit_id":"646d817a33a376011ec5c6fd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Bing","original_name":"王兵","popularity":0.733,"profile_path":"/h7VnG6T1HYSBBOAuhy7tYAtawO6.jpg","credit_id":"646d81812bcf670172b36e61","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
