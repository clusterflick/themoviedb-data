Knights, elves and magicians are fighting orcs and the dark powers. What looks like a scene from Lord of the Rings actually takes place in a field in Germany, where thousands of role players meet to plunge into a fantasy world of their own. More than 250.000 people in Germany regularly make this transition. The documentary accompanies five role players in their daily lives and their parallel ones. Where does their yearning for a shared world of fantasy come from? What does this reveal about our hectic, technological life? Sunday warriors is a film about the passion for playing and the ambition to exceed your limits.","popularity":0.8299,"poster_path":"/tdPDilfjsyfnfUOpkrBP1LX3jrT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8197,"logo_path":"/614xBoHyCqgiCK8qbGZXreholvh.png","name":"Beetz Brothers Film Production","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunday Warriors","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328871,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Beetz","original_name":"Christian Beetz","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5394b2eac3a36864340031ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41300,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Axel Schneppat","original_name":"Axel Schneppat","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5394b38ac3a3686423003206","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323415,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Georg Tschurtschenthaler","original_name":"Georg Tschurtschenthaler","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5394b30bc3a36864340031b0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Geiger","original_name":"Andreas Geiger","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5394b2c8c3a36864230031ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2736328","wikidata_id":"Q19845289","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1431,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tdPDilfjsyfnfUOpkrBP1LX3jrT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10196,"name":"role playing"},{"id":280322,"name":"larp"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"WOCHENENDKRIEGER | Trailer german deutsch [HD]","key":"OxVICc8tWMY","published_at":"2013-07-09T12:09:22.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5394b4c2c3a368642b0031df"}]}}}
