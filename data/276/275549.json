Yet few know about the National AIDS Memorial Grove, a seven-acre sanctuary hidden in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park and a testament to lives lost at a time when the stigma of AIDS forced many to grieve in silence. THE GROVE shows how a community in crisis found healing and remembrance, and how the seeds of a few visionary environmentalists blossomed into something larger than they could have imagined.","popularity":0.0822,"poster_path":"/6uMGssbinCPGDc44M7T6kGdgBBk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Grove","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Abrahams Wilson","original_name":"Andy Abrahams Wilson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9b2d620e0a2630b8033570","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1789065","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6uMGssbinCPGDc44M7T6kGdgBBk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
