He is unimpressed by their modest but hardly primitive country home, disgusted and disheartened by their unpalatable fare. So begins \"Guttaperc,\" a film by Barbados-born producer/director Andrew Millington. But the Caribbean world Eric finds himself in is not as simple as he thought. Indeed, it is one caught in a struggle, represented by the two figures that dominate his life: his grandfather (played by Clairmonte Taitt), a local supplier of construction materials, and Sister Pam (Leonie Forbes), an elderly woman with her feet and gnarled cane firmly planted in the past.","popularity":0.0823,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":64927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shango Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"BB","name":"Barbados"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guttaperc","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1519486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Weekes","original_name":"Richard Weekes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eric","credit_id":"56140f2ac3a368680e018467","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1519487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clairmonte Taitt","original_name":"Clairmonte Taitt","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Eric's Grandfather","credit_id":"56140f3ec3a3686810019135","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1519488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonie Forbes","original_name":"Leonie Forbes","popularity":0.0615,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sister Pam","credit_id":"56140f4b9251414ec6009304","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1519485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Millington","original_name":"Andrew Millington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56140e6e9251414ec60092ee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1519485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Millington","original_name":"Andrew Millington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56140e649251412d3c0003b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0255207","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
