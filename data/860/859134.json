These records were recorded by José Goglian, an Armenian immigrant, who in the 1940s lived in Villa del Cerro (a Montevidean neighborhood made up of many immigrant groups) and who invited his neighbour carnival musicians to his apartment to record them with a phonograph. This documentary is focused on Marcel's passionate bond with the murga genre, as he writes the lyrics for a group that is preparing for the next carnival, while looking for a way to revive the music of these albums that awaited sixty-eight years to be heard.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/58itxHCrn1Gxgn6GYZhyBA43Kvr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2018-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"78
