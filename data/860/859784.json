The source material for this video was filmed in a Korean factory and at Information Technology College in Pusan, Korea, with extensive use of macro-focus and close-up. This intense examination of the behavior of industrial machinery is well suited to the precise, exacting quality of Cho's digital editing, in which \"real\" images are multiplied, re-sized, and rhythmically sequenced. The soundtrack, composed by the artist, alternates between stretches of silence and periods of eerie noise, complimenting the elegance of this composition.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xrBEqXFV8Fyk7CHxzH5nOjHdz4a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xrBEqXFV8Fyk7CHxzH5nOjHdz4a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
