It tells the story of Sister Adel, a light-hearted young nun who goes to a farming village in Ifugao to teach catechism and eventually build a schoolhouse. As she breaks the traditions of the tribe, she makes a big difference in the little lives of its people, especially that of Dacmay, a seven-year-old rowdy girl in search of her lost mother's love. At the same time, Sister Adel finally discovers her real mission in life. This is a poignant story of friendship and love that transcends age, culture, and belief. A tale that is at times comic and inevitably tragic, this is a film about being a woman, and more importantly, being human. It all begins at the time of preparing rice paddies for planting, in that season of hopes and dreams called \"haw-ang.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/iGcpgJDneqBA6iPBp0QR9cs2hDy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2008-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afar","iso_639_1":"aa","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hope Begins Where Hope Begins","title":"Earth's Whisper","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaymar Generana","original_name":"Jaymar Generana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61123e1cafa1b0007e338740","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelson Dino","original_name":"Nelson Dino","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61123e27255dba005ded473c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucia Cijas","original_name":"Lucia Cijas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61123e594a52f80026e4abdb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3192246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Mae Soco-Bantayan","original_name":"Joan Mae Soco-Bantayan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61123e6601e4d1005e91424f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295728,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arnel Mardoquio","original_name":"Arnel Mardoquio","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/2qaPVP8PoqfjnmtXMZrOD7cuKs0.jpg","credit_id":"61123e86344a8e0048ba1fd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295728,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arnel Mardoquio","original_name":"Arnel Mardoquio","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/2qaPVP8PoqfjnmtXMZrOD7cuKs0.jpg","credit_id":"61fa8eb76f31af006a90e143","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1239365","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iGcpgJDneqBA6iPBp0QR9cs2hDy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
