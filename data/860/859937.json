At his students' urging, he recalls his surreal first love during the turbulent 1980s. As a college student, Su Young falls in love with spunky wild child Pippi Langstrump, only to see her commit suicide in front of his eyes. Strangely enough, she mysteriously reappears soon after. Adding to his confusion, Su Young finds himself increasingly drawn to and frightened by Su Ji, a quirky high school girl that he is tutoring.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
