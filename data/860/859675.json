Opera star Man-ha (Leung Bik-yuk) enjoys tremendous popularity during her performances in San Francisco, but drowns herself in the vices and temptations of the big city. Increasingly, she fails to show up for performances, almost causing the theatre to go bankrupt. When she sees her lover for the scoundrel that he is, she also sees the errors of her own ways and saves the theatre, restoring it to glory. Joseph Sunn Jue established the Grandview Film Company in Hong Kong during the 1930s and continued making films in the USA during wartime by collaborating with Chinese opera performers in exile there. Wong Hok-sing, an opera actor himself, directed, wrote and starred in this film. He staged a spectacular play-within-a-play at the end, not only to promote the art of Cantonese opera but also to boost solidarity among overseas Chinese through difficult times.","popularity":0.1981,"poster_path":"/3MOc3d3GvxbdhhTeznNl6lW7CtN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grandview (US Branch)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1947-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Powder and Neon Lights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Jin Fen Ni Shang","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Jinfen Nishang","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Gam Fan Ngai Seung","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Gold Braided Dress","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hok Sing Wong","original_name":"Hok Sing Wong","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Leung Man","credit_id":"611152c40b5fd6002a2a8d1c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3192370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leung Bik-yuk","original_name":"Leung Bik-yuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Man-ha","credit_id":"611152d0afa1b0007e31b5bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luk Won Fee","original_name":"Luk Won Fee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"611152da0b5fd6002a2a8d71","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3192372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tang Pui","original_name":"Tang Pui","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sek Tsang","credit_id":"611152e5255dba002f500817","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3192373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Kei-wai","original_name":"Liu Kei-wai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"611152ee0c2710005e588ffa","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hok Sing Wong","original_name":"Hok Sing Wong","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64126a1bb4224200b97409df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hok Sing Wong","original_name":"Hok Sing Wong","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641269eca6c10400d8d87889","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905599,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiu Shu-San","original_name":"Chiu Shu-San","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64126b0ab4224200826f68e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0192181","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uaTzNaqguDQ15hUvLee4XuXw9Xh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/3MOc3d3GvxbdhhTeznNl6lW7CtN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":582,"name":"san francisco, california"},{"id":221307,"name":"chinese opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"1947-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
