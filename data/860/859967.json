The railway opened in 1907, linking the villages of Waterhouses and Hulme End, and was built mainly for agricultural traffic, with a passenger service being a secondary consideration. Its route went through beautiful countryside in Staffordshire, and it is unfortunate that the intertitles state it as being shot in Derbyshire.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/tIrWYw6W60y1uRyx0YkP3MmDtHn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7396,"logo_path":"/jnjLKDfdAfNylfVdybY9370Ybrg.png","name":"Pathe","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1930-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Quaint Little Railway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tIrWYw6W60y1uRyx0YkP3MmDtHn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Quaint Little Railway (1930)","key":"dWZbZGGnE6E","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":true,"published_at":"2008-10-10T13:12:50.000Z","id":"656270fa7dfda6592ee5dc1a"}]}}}
