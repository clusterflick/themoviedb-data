The train from Gwangju was supposed to arrive, but it didn't. Two staffs attempt to reach out, but nobody picks up the phone. The chief tries to calm himself down, saying his family in Gwangju would be safe now. The film, without direct depiction, masterfully illustrates people's sadness and anxiety around the time of the Gwangju uprising.","popularity":0.0996,"poster_path":"/3h13yn7bfhunk4IP5MdLXOB5n85.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Blooming Railroad","title":"A Blooming Railroad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gi Ju-bong","original_name":"기주봉","popularity":0.5072,"profile_path":"/uliB2ZpdxcnDqPCG34YB69qR8vp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"610f0ffdf6fd18007d286ed9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3055255,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kim Kyung-min","original_name":"Kim Kyung-min","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"610f100a5bce9e004669f225","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3190165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Rae-won","original_name":"Kim Rae-won","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610f1022ae38434467b99ea7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3190165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Rae-won","original_name":"Kim Rae-won","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613f331b9450fe002cad0248","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sqHSqNFSSHzxp9E6PXO2uvltnxa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/3h13yn7bfhunk4IP5MdLXOB5n85.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
