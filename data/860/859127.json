There is no answer, there hasn't been for years. She has no pride, no support - she alone must safeguard her own survival. Her name is Lady Liuwa, and she is the Last Lioness. Isolated by a scourge of illegal trophy hunting that wiped out the rest of her species in the region, Lady Liuwa is the only known resident lion surviving on Zambia's Liuwa Plain. For four years, cameraman Herbert Brauer watched her lonely life unfold, until, in her solitude, she reached out to him for companionship. But Herbert knows he is not the companion this lonely lioness needs - she should be amongst her own kind. Now, in May of 2009, plans for a male lion translocation have come through, and there is hope for ending her isolation. For the first time in more than five years, Lady Liuwa will no longer be the Last Lioness.","popularity":0.5427,"poster_path":"/hdef4F6XYxJwQC2nptrr9dYdSfV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aquavision TV Productions","origin_country":"ZA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Lioness","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermione Gulliford","original_name":"Hermione Gulliford","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/bx6YXpyDFigYp4ytlRCQ1rm8xqV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"666ce8e884d88464f404a594","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3992886,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Herbert Brauer","original_name":"Herbert Brauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/eBqrj8GUqRyUqC6lzCME2vNY43i.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Host","credit_id":"666ce8f8ee01ab1c6261b203","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3992882,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bronwyn Watkins","original_name":"Bronwyn Watkins","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666ce8a3be445abed304b422","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203570,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benjamin Willem","original_name":"Benjamin Willem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bkAZ2zvDNAr3LpucB4riratABUF.jpg","credit_id":"666ce947f55a057f3a61d2d5","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3992886,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Herbert Brauer","original_name":"Herbert Brauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/eBqrj8GUqRyUqC6lzCME2vNY43i.jpg","credit_id":"666ce91ef52c17a3d2998a0e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3992882,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bronwyn Watkins","original_name":"Bronwyn Watkins","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666ce87efb27f3bc98c6c9ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6172194","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3enE3TK7ESHEO7p09usgzOBf2aS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2880},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jPuFIo4FvoSk2P6AokY0vhTtAgE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2880},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1jPrDiqOUKPmtK3P2SS6Z4x11mZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2880}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2184,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hdef4F6XYxJwQC2nptrr9dYdSfV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1542}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Aquavision","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
