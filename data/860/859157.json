After a long absence, she is commissioned to write two short screenplays for two different directors. In-seok, a box office movie director, and Kyeong-sik, an independent movie director. She's racking her brains to upgrade herself from being a composition writer to a screenwriter, but her writing sucks. Moreover, she received requests from two different movie concepts at once, so she couldn't properly pay attention to either one. She thought it would be easy to tweak them a little bit because the content is similar to each other, but the directors have different tastes, so it becomes more difficult. With not much time left until the first deadline, she eventually pushes herself into her studio with a drastic measure. She keeps wearing yellow sweatshirts and pants because of the jinx that she has to wear them to be able to write well, but she continues to struggle. She is confused and wonders whether it is her imagination or reality.","popularity":0.5263,"poster_path":"/lZC9cgoatfbJoQyrGYX8J0Lapkg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secret Female Writer's Private Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"隐秘女作家的私生活","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Do Mo-se","original_name":"Do Mo-Se","popularity":0.8146,"profile_path":"/jYyrYpgcDRxjE5LhvCb41ra5lgy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6111f0e7f04d01001f95a420","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2094677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Hyun-jung","original_name":"Park Hyun-jung","popularity":1.9115,"profile_path":"/8I83P6HnCmXoeQITnaFDA9nsnfv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67907c89297a5d91d077472d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1907998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kang Min-woo","original_name":"Kang Min-woo","popularity":2.1634,"profile_path":"/pIrr35CLdzsL5Gt7nGgP8lumv9a.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67907ccefc2519b43f774739","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1997928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jin Joo","original_name":"진주","popularity":2.7192,"profile_path":"/awN0RgLUn0j8AsGsC4JNT1gdkVI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67907cdba7f27130bb28a652","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z6cbkHgDNdBSfXQR1tBEMuAiEtd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hvGz6zkBs8ccIGaC4u7Y38vlhkj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3tBScUSUGytK3FnewPvZTSUwMdU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lZC9cgoatfbJoQyrGYX8J0Lapkg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
