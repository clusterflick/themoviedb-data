While his peers focused on gore and killing, Bill Zebub opted for rape and nudity. No, he didn't glorify the crimes. Bill Zebub always tries to offer what other directors do not. Sexual assualt is FAR more common than murder, so why is it taboo while killing people in in many genres, even shown in daytime on television? Serial killers are sexual predators. Why are movies about serial killers sanitized of the sex crimes? Some of those movies resemble soap operas, not horror flicks. Regardless, this collection of behind-the-scenes footage shows the mood during filming harsh scenes. You get to decide if this is sleaze or art.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/tKytUPbldKbXs1IRkImXbioSFBg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sleaze or Art?","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Zebub","original_name":"Bill Zebub","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":"/bhZNgeH9PbnxFCsKeOZEzBVewQ1.jpg","credit_id":"61104283426ae8005d6e2dc3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tKytUPbldKbXs1IRkImXbioSFBg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
