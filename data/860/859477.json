They seek to build a shelter where they can escape from family abandonment, neighbor´s cruelty, and the constant stalking by the police. In a seemingly desolate neighborhood, with factory sounds and rusty walls, the four teenagers are constantly observed by people around them. Inhabit narrates the transitory, the impossibility of building and creating a sense of belonging in a hostile place with a marginalizing environment.","popularity":0.0741,"poster_path":"/xlta4nXot8uiKMpTEyzaSzgcBdQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2021-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lo habitado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gonzalo Casco","original_name":"Gonzalo Casco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61107d14f04d01005c7700f7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3191518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Emiliano Díaz","original_name":"Martín Emiliano Díaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61107c914a52f8005cc67543","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3191518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Emiliano Díaz","original_name":"Martín Emiliano Díaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61107c9c01e4d1005e8e7822","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14963298","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xlta4nXot8uiKMpTEyzaSzgcBdQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Santiago International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
