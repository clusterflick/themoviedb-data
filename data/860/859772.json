Stradoberdha’s humorous, buoyant style led him to be one of the country’s most promising filmmakers. But after being denounced in 1956, he was expelled from the Kinostudio and sent into internal exile. In 1967, Stratoberdha directed a local theater play in which the economic five year plan was placed in a coffin. He was then jailed for the next two decades. Urime Shokë Studentë! is one of the surviving documentaries of Viktor Stratoberdha’s all too short career.","popularity":0.2998,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1956-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Congratulations, Comrade Student!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3192737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Stradoberdha","original_name":"Viktor Stradoberdha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611189d6d05a03007f5215ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0346093","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2903,"name":"propaganda"},{"id":2941,"name":"albania"},{"id":189420,"name":"communist propaganda"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sq","note":"","release_date":"1956-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
