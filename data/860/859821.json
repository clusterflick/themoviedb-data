In this case his eyes are drawn to the motion of the boat in relation to the scenery outside its windows, to the characters of individuals and their relationships to one another and the sheer, visual and emotional beauty of it all. The passengers, on their daily commute, remain unaware of the splendor Jennings sees--and makes us see. -Karen Treanor","popularity":0.0945,"poster_path":"/8NTZnByfdGMGG5CcmkaE9iXXEo0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost and Found","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jennings","original_name":"Jim Jennings","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/msfx2Tb9rP4KSAHI09SICAg4w9R.jpg","credit_id":"6111b30665e0a20073a812ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2332,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8NTZnByfdGMGG5CcmkaE9iXXEo0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
