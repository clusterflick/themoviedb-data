Deeply disturbed by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Agee imagined New York destroyed. In the ruins, Chaplin's Little Tramp builds a shack in Central Park. Gradually a small community of the dispossessed grows up around him. For Agee, his story was a thought experiment about how one might start again in the aftermath of disaster, to go beyond capitalism and just how hard that is in the face of our modern technological world. The film focuses on his imaginative journey and what it might mean for us today.","popularity":0.5251,"poster_path":"/sdr3guDVjQW2JJ9Q079MiHIFekF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Besties Make Movies, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tramp's New World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barrett Martin","original_name":"Barrett Martin","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/z39r1UMrmUw1wd9OK9vniyNPVwX.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"James Agee","credit_id":"610fb231e635710060d6f8ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1456340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana DeLaCruz","original_name":"Diana DeLaCruz","popularity":0.098,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Beatriz Valdes","credit_id":"610fb240afa1b0005e4becbc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1231358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Rattazzi","original_name":"Steven Rattazzi","popularity":0.1784,"profile_path":"/vxVIZs1nulLVmqHig2CbVMkvhCM.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"James W.
