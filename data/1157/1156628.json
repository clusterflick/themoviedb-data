The film was shot by Georges Tairraz II, Chamoniard mountain photographer, representative of the third generation of a family line of mountain photographers and filmmakers. George Tairraz II's film will lay the groundwork for a French vision of mountain film; In the 1930s, a French school of mountain cinema emerged, less expressionist, more stripped down and realistic than the German school. These are the films of Marcel Ichac, Roger Frison-Roche, Samivel, Georges Tairraz II, etc. It develops according to the principles set by Marcel Ichac, in opposition to the German school. It is both about getting out of the dramatic vision of the mountain and placing the mountain and the climbers at the heart of the plot.","popularity":0.2827,"poster_path":"/8JcPe7AKbAcDQoiAE06EldRYvyq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1924-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Ascension Des Aiguilles Ravanel Et Mummery","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3863819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armand Charlet","original_name":"Armand Charlet","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/yPG4PoEqzyTYvPWIzusFc9OE1aX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c13ff71cfe3a0eb30bf7dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4181484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Charlet","original_name":"Georges Charlet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/8vcjsc2vIartYm9nxi6NA7opSsv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c14003097c49013a316e1e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4181490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Ravanel","original_name":"Arthur Ravanel","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/dgehMWISLAVKN7K6q8vVhBof4kO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c140a4fdc1460139f9e773","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4181492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Couttet","original_name":"Henri Couttet","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/oTiICBuH09w3MGj2FqRXs8GCidE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c140d6fdc14600ff731ee8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4181493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Balmat","original_name":"Charles Balmat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c14125fdc14600e28619d3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3683246,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Georges Tairraz II","original_name":"Georges Tairraz II","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iy598sa3blmE2v5jUYDSUXIzi3p.jpg","credit_id":"64c13fdc871b3400aea3be63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3683246,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Georges Tairraz II","original_name":"Georges Tairraz II","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iy598sa3blmE2v5jUYDSUXIzi3p.jpg","credit_id":"64d034b7549dda00c53f8a06","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f79QEXXTiKA6HwPeWvtC9RKVEQI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8JcPe7AKbAcDQoiAE06EldRYvyq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"zu","file_path":"/ajMgXqtAcjkXYau4tD72OrhKI38.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160177,"name":"mountaineering"},{"id":215368,"name":"chamonix"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":266669,"name":"alpes"},{"id":299422,"name":"french climbers"},{"id":307663,"name":"mountain pioneer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1924-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
