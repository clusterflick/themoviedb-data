A roped party joined on snow and ice the Col du Géant, reached at the Mont-Blanc-du-Tacul stop and on the Col du Diable. The men cross the needles by climbing chimneys, cracks and abseiling walls. They access the eastern slope of the Mont-Blanc massif which offers a panorama of the Grandes Jorasses and Mont-Blanc. Armand Charlet was the first to reach the summits of four needles above 4000 meters: the Devil's Horn, Pointe Chaubert, Pointe Médiane and Pointe Carmen; he also tells how he successfully climbed the furthest, the Isolated. Marcel Ichac shot these scenes as close as possible to his subject, he responded with this film with a “truth” cinema, the principle of which we find in his later productions.","popularity":0.1982,"poster_path":"/jNxm0tPDTV3iDZDb5xdZCiBMyZ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":204811,"logo_path":"/dWtAoC50kitFXuu9DXQC1opMDUn.png","name":"Comptoir du Film Français Documentaire (CFFD)","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1943-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A l'Assaut Des Aiguilles Du Diable","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3863819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armand Charlet","original_name":"Armand Charlet","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/yPG4PoEqzyTYvPWIzusFc9OE1aX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c07b5c097c4900c642c3d8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4180525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Burnet","original_name":"Bernard Burnet","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c07bb6514c4a00e79af833","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4180545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Cachet","original_name":"André Cachet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c07eab097c49013a310ef9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4180547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Édouard Ravanel","original_name":"Édouard Ravanel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c07ee3514c4a00c80079a9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4180548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Carle","original_name":"Jean Carle","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c07ef713a320011c5eed0a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2587010,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tony Aubin","original_name":"Tony Aubin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c07cb4df86a800c8e8300d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1318373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Ichac","original_name":"Marcel Ichac","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/muVoucOuVJM5iCIEoV3bmIvH1jk.jpg","credit_id":"64c0786513a32000ffbe7033","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kADllqtWjBnaORCuXOJHy5EgcoK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7fSo57iGGlXOOhU4IJC6eqx9pus.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AwjWJQat9Wnn7QvYIDCl2WiyjYF.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jNxm0tPDTV3iDZDb5xdZCiBMyZ9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160177,"name":"mountaineering"},{"id":215368,"name":"chamonix"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":299422,"name":"french climbers"},{"id":307663,"name":"mountain pioneer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
