Ytzen and Rinke because they live in the middle of the woods, Robert because he cycles through the woods every day to get to work. Behind the grid time seems to pass in a different way. Or as Ytzen says \"there is no time, there is just being\". They also see things they have never seen before, such as trees that lose their leaves in September and plants that want to start growing in the middle of winter. You will also see Wietse de Haan and Evert Prummel, they build instruments from dead trees. All the music you hear in the film was played on these tree instruments and recorded in the forest. Okki herself also occasionally passes by. She has been coming to this piece of forest all her life, which is a kilometer from the house where she grew up. Not only has she known the forest, but also Robert, Ytzen and Rinke for most of her life.","popularity":0.22,"poster_path":"/3TAz9LlbrREuzH7rWSxobhkjNLz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Over het Wildrooster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3109962,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wietse de Haan","original_name":"Wietse de Haan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c24349097c4900c643adaf","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3109960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Okki Poortvliet","original_name":"Okki Poortvliet","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c24340df86a8012582f872","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vBm5jXQYXpqH1OUNhtJyr0kcfZr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3TAz9LlbrREuzH7rWSxobhkjNLz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3693,"name":"climate"},{"id":5774,"name":"forest"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer Over het Wildrooster","key":"848994271","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-07-27T07:27:11.000Z","id":"64c243a5df86a800c8e8f475"}]}}}
