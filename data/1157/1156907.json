She wanders happily around the farm, helping out in any way possible. She tends to the pigs, and is present from the fertilisation of the sows to the moment the truck leaves for the slaughterhouse. The family farm teaches her about the circle of life. However, new laws on nitrogen emissions have undermined the economic viability of the farm, and bankruptcy looms. Together with her cat Skeet, Leonie watches the last pigs disappear from the farm, and she realises that her dream of becoming a pig farmer might not come true.","popularity":0.2458,"poster_path":"/ccb6xd8yAB2vxpcMILyTZPsfWls.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120281,"logo_path":"/bvNKpqHF6cRGPrMRVAbKIcqn6XY.png","name":"De Mensen","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2023-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leonie, Skeet and the piglets","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4182783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonie","original_name":"Leonie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Leonie De Reu","credit_id":"64c21f621cfe3a0eb0a7e18c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3791828,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amber Van Acker","original_name":"Amber Van Acker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c21ff113a320011c5fb61d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2704169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jip Heijenga","original_name":"Jip Heijenga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c21f8bdb4ed600aeb07578","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2704169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jip Heijenga","original_name":"Jip Heijenga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c21fbddf86a800c8e8e2a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4182792,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Susobrino","original_name":"Susobrino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c22066ede1b000c8bd42a6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4182790,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wouter Frans","original_name":"Wouter Frans","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c2201fede1b000af4ca04c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4182789,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michael De Moor","original_name":"Michael De Moor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c2200c2f1be0010c823c52","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4182791,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stijn d'Alleine","original_name":"Stijn d'Alleine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c2202f13a3200139f12c6e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3704531,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yannis Van den Ecker","original_name":"Yannis Van den Ecker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c2204fede1b000c8bd4295","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4182785,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sofie Van Noten","original_name":"Sofie Van Noten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c21fa21cfe3a0eb0a7e1be","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4182788,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marielle Dazler","original_name":"Marielle Dazler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c21fd1df86a80106371114","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30835099","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":2809,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/ccb6xd8yAB2vxpcMILyTZPsfWls.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4932,"name":"farm"},{"id":1566,"name":"dreams"},{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":208349,"name":"kids"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
