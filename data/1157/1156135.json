The film explores the impact of chrono-photographic experiments of Irish-born Lucien Bull (1876 - 1972) on the developments of image-capture aesthetics and science throughout the 20th century, showing how technologies of vision were aggressively instrumentalised by the military-industrial complex, particularly by the nuclear testing industry. Using rarely-seen nuclear test footage alongside more poetic images and new film from the nuclear test site in Nevada, I See A Darkness questions cinema's relationship with the material world, with contributions from leading philosophers and writers.","popularity":0.2879,"poster_path":"/b7L6voGxnOwZ1BrZa3CyaOo3iUX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I See a Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katherine Waugh","original_name":"Katherine Waugh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da3ba6b77d4b1141f6e19c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4214554,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kevin Waugh","original_name":"Kevin Waugh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da3bc4f495ee028f6570cd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katherine Waugh","original_name":"Katherine Waugh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da3bb3f495ee0291a05d5e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1325378,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lucien Waugh-Daly","original_name":"Lucien Waugh-Daly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df23ee140bad0186947eef","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1325378,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lucien Waugh-Daly","original_name":"Lucien Waugh-Daly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6645ebe0fbddf970f1eed7c7","department":"Crew","job":"Public Relations"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katherine Waugh","original_name":"Katherine Waugh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bfb0728ee49c0fcfd6bc51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fergus Daly","original_name":"Fergus Daly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bfb06801757f013951fcdf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28486757","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dofz9IT4uBTObmAZYorHhKnvFI5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b7L6voGxnOwZ1BrZa3CyaOo3iUX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
