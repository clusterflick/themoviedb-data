A golden age that allowed them to fulfill their Bolivarian dream: to unite Latin America through music.","popularity":0.0519,"poster_path":"/a90sNN3lWKEUW7WBwJvEqG8Facl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224042,"logo_path":null,"name":"Resonance Films (FR)","origin_country":""},{"id":224043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Francute Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Escale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3126705,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Colin Idier","original_name":"Colin Idier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fb1c7f04733f0164e63aca","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1531282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Briceño","original_name":"Luis Briceño","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/joVEAJlm8tl5gD3uSZXHSXPMuPF.jpg","credit_id":"65fb1ca060620a017c25b0b2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4604713,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"loris bardi","original_name":"loris bardi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fb1cc83bd26e017d479791","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1531282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Briceño","original_name":"Luis Briceño","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/joVEAJlm8tl5gD3uSZXHSXPMuPF.jpg","credit_id":"65fb1cd9d40d4c017c707b08","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2746608,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kevin Brunet","original_name":"Kevin Brunet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fb1ceb770700017c06f73f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4604714,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maxime Pannetier","original_name":"Maxime Pannetier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fb1d100bc529017caea775","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4182840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Sextier","original_name":"Antoine Sextier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fb1d22a199a60162dddb06","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4604717,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julia Boudet","original_name":"Julia Boudet","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fb1d37d40d4c01306f5d1a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4604718,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lionel Bellion","original_name":"Lionel Bellion","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fb1d477707000163065b41","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4182840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Sextier","original_name":"Antoine Sextier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c22a9edb4ed6011ed79788","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3126706,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antoine Sextier","original_name":"Antoine Sextier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c22ab92f1be000ebd5da75","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1012,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a90sNN3lWKEUW7WBwJvEqG8Facl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":674}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Festival Inedit Chile","release_date":"2022-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jecheon International Music & Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Festival Rasnov Roumanie","release_date":"2023-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
