The four members of the far-right Proud Boys group were convicted on a charge of seditious conspiracy, defined as a plot to overthrow the government. US Prosecutors have now charged more than 1,000 people with offences in relation to the January 6, 2021 attack, but there is little agreement in a bitterly divided America about exactly what happened on that day. The dispute threatens to poison American democracy.  The BBC's David Grossman was there as events unfolded and filmed the Proud Boys and spoke to their leaders. He assesses what this infamous date means for the United States.","popularity":0.0679,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the weeks after the attack on the US Capitol, BBC Newsnight's Gabriel Gatehouse took a closer look at the movements of members of the far-right Proud Boys on 6 January.","title":"Proud Boys: The Battle for Jan 6th","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4181951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Grossman","original_name":"David Grossman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narration","credit_id":"64c1817e13a32000c532e97d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4181952,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Murtaugh","original_name":"Peter Murtaugh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c181c013a32000e21ab9ca","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4181951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Grossman","original_name":"David Grossman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c1819adf86a8010636c298","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4181951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Grossman","original_name":"David Grossman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c181ceede1b0011f7dab2c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2196136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vara Szajkowski","original_name":"Vara Szajkowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c18211be55b700c8d40d20","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4181953,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Peter Telfar","original_name":"Peter Telfar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c181e013a32000ad4e3f10","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4181951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Grossman","original_name":"David Grossman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c181aaede1b000af4c5a22","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4181954,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lucy Hennequin","original_name":"Lucy Hennequin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c181fd097c4900e3f35e3a","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editing"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jf6p3DhrW0wd6XauLerOv9OAA8H.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":206515,"name":"usa politics"},{"id":260872,"name":"america"},{"id":315144,"name":"january6"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
