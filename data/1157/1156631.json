The film-making process was tactile; shot through hand-cut mattes, prisms, and colored and kaleidoscopic filters to create physical constraints that bend and channel light through mechanical, spring-wound cameras. Each frame is embedded with devotion to cosmic light; an homage to ROYGBIV imprinted on film in spectral array.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9lwDulZTgiWnwuySRafY5HAubQ1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Rainbow in Curved Air","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4078471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erren Franklin","original_name":"Erren Franklin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c13c4fdf86a80125827a44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9lwDulZTgiWnwuySRafY5HAubQ1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
