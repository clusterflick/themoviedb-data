He interviews many of the game’s great champions and more than a few colorful characters, who are asked the question, “What is the spirit of golf?” We hear from Arnold Palmer, Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller, the wonderfully unique Moe Norman, Kathy Whitworth and Nancy Lopez, and notable teachers such as David Leadbetter, “Butch” Harmon and commentators Herbert Warren Wind, Jack Whitaker, and Jim Nantz. All the answers are marvelously diverse, funny, and poetic… just like the game itself.","popularity":0.8174,"poster_path":"/dZIkmbgv6YboNzQCEeLRWq3mEGz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A quest for the essence of the ole Scotts game from Pebble Beach to St. Andrews","title":"Spirit of Golf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1931106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnold Palmer","original_name":"Arnold Palmer","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":"/hGSUEnHUP08lodRhsekiUFCc7RY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64bf5cf6bb070d0230b4336d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4178845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Trent Jones","original_name":"Robert Trent Jones","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64bf5d086d4c9700e275f0dd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4178847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Murphy","original_name":"Michael Murphy","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64bf5d4c8ee49c00fe0f0064","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4178848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Norman","original_name":"Moe Norman","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64bf5d6105822400eed7ddab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Murray","original_name":"Bill Murray","popularity":2.4555,"profile_path":"/nnCsJc9x3ZiG3AFyiyc3FPehppy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64bf5d726d4c97011cb9e5db","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Nantz","original_name":"Jim Nantz","popularity":0.1359,"profile_path":"/9pab4RYAfFeqA0XEh4cx3vXTCE1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64bf5d7b05822401303af952","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1218607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiger Woods","original_name":"Tiger Woods","popularity":0.3991,"profile_path":"/cUofgaNgM71mgoXpOUA69A5415w.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64bf5d8a05822400cd27ca3e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Hopper","original_name":"Dennis Hopper","popularity":1.2061,"profile_path":"/kqyNvLHi5RZGZcZMxl7e6XvoB5U.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64bf5d9ab3316b011c6fe154","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4178849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Lopez","original_name":"Nancy Lopez","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"64bf5dbf447f9c0139fab85f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Nicklaus","original_name":"Jack Nicklaus","popularity":0.1275,"profile_path":"/y8Lwe1FoqflagwxgmdeFBvg5JOZ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"64bf5dd7b3316b011c6fe172","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4178851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Felver","original_name":"Christopher Felver","popularity":0.0472,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bf5e1fbb070d0238f316cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dZIkmbgv6YboNzQCEeLRWq3mEGz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
