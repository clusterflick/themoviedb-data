The tones of her life are a mix of boredom, melancholy, and frustration, alongside many questions about the direction she's heading. Working at a souvenir and accessory stand at one of the many solidarity economy fairs held on her university campus, she happens to meet another woman. This woman had a large travel backpack full of buttons and trinkets, souvenirs from the various places she had been, along with a heavy, oversized jacket and a curious gaze that explored the place. Bia didn’t know her name, but when she arrived at Bia’s stand with many questions about belonging, the young vendor wanted to know everything. That’s how their conversation began, as they started discovering one another. This experience takes place on a very reflective night, during which both will learn more about life and existence.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Color of the Universe is Beige","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5606750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanna Freire","original_name":"Giovanna Freire","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/rbzheh335VlfD9ZdYoIihgDjj3Z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bia","credit_id":"689cd140a1ebf014ce268f79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4266586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcela Coêlho","original_name":"Marcela Coêlho","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Leticia","credit_id":"689cd1ab2f760b149d1a3808","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4732354,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alex Kreibich","original_name":"Alex Kreibich","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689cd1df017d0bc9ecc7041a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
