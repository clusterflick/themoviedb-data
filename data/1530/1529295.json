To achieve this, the artist constructed a set tailored to the filmed frame, resulting in spatial fragments of the uninhabitable. Torres-Alzaga's interest is to intertwine visual veils with spectral aspects of Gothic literature that cinema has rescued through the horror genre, and to work with the figure of the ghost—vaporous and difficult to perceive—as an inhabitant of the cracks of the established order. An absent presence where dissident bodies were able to generate other ways of perceiving.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/g8KaumBFw2JjjGbZBn4nQ9JyAKr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2023-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las desinvitadas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.744,"height":2098,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g8KaumBFw2JjjGbZBn4nQ9JyAKr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
