Without her partner ever showing violence towards her, she fears that if she leaves him, something terrible will happen. Out at Six tells the story of Livi, the filmmaker, through a timeline divided into eight stages based on research taken from hundreds of cases in which women were murdered by their partners. The film is compiled from interviews with people closest to her, reflecting how the surrounding environment witnesses the reality of such relationships.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/sVkJSdltL2hUAAjEmBCFPqVFKWl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anemos Productions","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2025-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out at Six","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Livi Kessel","original_name":"Livi Kessel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/i3fu0hF6KdI31rGGjTxxvo8EfRU.jpg","credit_id":"689c6e19124b7c08f45d1f5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Livi Kessel","original_name":"Livi Kessel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/i3fu0hF6KdI31rGGjTxxvo8EfRU.jpg","credit_id":"689c6e3220dfc6b0e0c703e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851218,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Einav Giat Goodman","original_name":"Einav Giat Goodman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689c6e496791872e1a6d7ec8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5623272,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"May Abadi Grebler","original_name":"May Abadi Grebler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689c6e57aecb6c64866d78ee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889574,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naomi Meroz","original_name":"Naomi Meroz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689c6e7b2bc79d9c128db4ed","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5623274,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Arik Lahav Leibovitch","original_name":"Arik Lahav Leibovitch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689c6e9b124b7c08f45d1f6b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2594254,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Meir","original_name":"Daniel Meir","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689c6ed92bc79d9c128db4f0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Livi Kessel","original_name":"Livi Kessel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/i3fu0hF6KdI31rGGjTxxvo8EfRU.jpg","credit_id":"689c71b190a5208a7e268d46","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302879,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sol Goodman","original_name":"Sol Goodman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689c71c3a2918d7dec8db632","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36936769","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sVkJSdltL2hUAAjEmBCFPqVFKWl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":857}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docaviv International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2025-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
