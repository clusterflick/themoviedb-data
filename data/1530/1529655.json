Through the exchange of letters between the director Changmin Lee and Keongson Lee’s daughter Muttita Fletcher (Ryeo Lee), the film pieces together Keongson Lee’s life as a refugee during an era of historical tragedy. By examining these personal correspondences, Dear Elephant reveals how history and personal memory intertwine, shedding light on Lee’s experiences and the legacy he left behind.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Elephant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10602656","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
