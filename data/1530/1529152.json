The film was lost and all that remains is one still-image, conflicting written accounts and a title: Elsa, Baroness von Freytag-Loringhoven, Shaving Her Pubic Hair.  Lene Berg’s Shaving the Baroness is a restaging built on rumours and conflicting sources, and can be seen as a tribute to the so-called Dada-Baroness. As no original exists, Berg attempts to recreate the lost filmscene with two actors. A real situation is played out, one that cannot be rehearsed and where the director has little control. We are voyeurs of an intimate exchange something perhaps originally intended as a provocation and which might have changed the baroness’s life and destiny.﻿","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2010-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shaving The Baroness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5621906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dunja Eckert-Jakobi","original_name":"Dunja Eckert-Jakobi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Baroness","credit_id":"689b84056c45426dd35d1d2e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5621910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leander Djønne","original_name":"Leander Djønne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Shaver","credit_id":"689b842a5f6878f4815e420c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413619,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lene Berg","original_name":"Lene Berg","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689b83ad20b58d04998db222","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
