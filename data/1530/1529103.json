Through a sensorial, hybrid form that blends microscopic footage with alienesque terrains, the film follows the mosquito’s passage through unfamiliar environments as it struggles to understand its own body and purpose. Disoriented and unmoored, the insect becomes a vessel for broader existential questions, transformation and displacement. Shot on expired 16mm film along the northeastern coast of Brazil, the film evokes both decay and discovery.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alheio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3613528,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pedro Paulo Araujo","original_name":"Pedro Paulo Araujo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689b6b6f76150be6911a32f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1165386,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ivo Lopes Araújo","original_name":"Ivo Lopes Araújo","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/P0DfB23ls6aljK1K9kMafmVflg.jpg","credit_id":"689b6bb1cbea66507a8db2ad","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Furtado","original_name":"Victor Furtado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689b6bcbd1029113e65d1e05","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37655329","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
