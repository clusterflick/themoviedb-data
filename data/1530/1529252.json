It discusses the issue of shoplifting and the various measures taken by retail stores to combat it. It highlights the significant financial losses due to shoplifting, which amount to over $3.5 billion annually in the U.S. Stores often mark up prices to cover these losses, which can be particularly challenging for small businesses. The film explains that many shoplifters are teenagers who steal for emotional reasons, peer pressure, or thrills rather than necessity. It emphasizes that shoplifting is a serious crime with legal consequences, including a police record. Various security measures are described, such as trained security staff, surveillance cameras, electronic tags, and packaging techniques that make it harder for shoplifters to steal items. The film also follows a scenario where security tracks and apprehends suspected shoplifters using surveillance and communication.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charles Cahill & Associates","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shoplifting is Stealing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10261,"name":"stealing"},{"id":14604,"name":"theft"},{"id":18420,"name":"surveillance"},{"id":155419,"name":"shoplifting"},{"id":167726,"name":"surveillance footage"},{"id":209085,"name":"shoplifter"},{"id":307763,"name":"scare film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1975-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\" SHOPLIFTING IS STEALING \"  1975 ANTI-THEFT SCARE FILM  SURVEILLANCE & LEGAL CONSEQUENCES SM10785","key":"i0HZLdmRpac","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-08-07T19:29:48.000Z","id":"689bca05fe728cb8626d78f0"}]}}}
