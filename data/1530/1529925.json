Some never passed quality control, others were chosen but faced unexpected challenges at the hands of their owners. Through confessional monologues, they share their stories - absurd, tragic and surprisingly familiar. Mixing irony with existential musings, the film shows how, in a world where beauty is becoming disposable, the pressure to live up to the ideal only accelerates its own destruction.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8O6fwIVQNIO3JgGAdG2069wsX8a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2025-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Идеально отвергнутые","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Idealno otvergnutye","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2683916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uldus Bakhtiozina","original_name":"Юлдус Бахтиозина","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689dc4dab787a192fb268fc4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/8O6fwIVQNIO3JgGAdG2069wsX8a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Koroche Short And Debut Film Festival","release_date":"2025-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
