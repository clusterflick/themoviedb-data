This is the premise of the short film Innermost Heart. Viewers are taken on a journey filled with thought-provoking and entertaining moments, confronting everyday prejudices born of human peculiarities, the generational gap, and the transformative power of love. The short film is based on stories and a screenplay written by Olivér Gömbös, a young creator on the autism spectrum. For many years, Olivér has been expressing himself and his view of the world through unique, special film narratives. With a talented creative team and outstanding actors, director Tamás Németh Pákolicz has helped bring Olivér’s greatest cinematic dream to life through the making of this film.","popularity":0.1143,"poster_path":"/m79KkEbeaCtUD1LHVrQNnTtFYj3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":270931,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalandoor
