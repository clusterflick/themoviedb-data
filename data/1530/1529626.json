During her trek across Canada in the summer of 1992, she made the Wiggins Bay Blockade one of her stops. For three days, the megaphone sat on top of the hill overlooking the clearcut area across from the PROTECTORS OF MOTHER EARTH camp the leaders had set up. Speaking to Their Mother is a document/conversation with Rebecca about her way of working and how art is seen by the people. She ends up creating a dead-tree forest memorial before her stay is over","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ayumee-aawach OOmama-mowan: Speaking to Their Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3148655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Belmore","original_name":"Rebecca Belmore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"689ceed910ba8593fc5e45a4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3134569,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marjorie Beaucage","original_name":"Marjorie Beaucage","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689ceefdbfab2d7e585d20ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
