It was a place where people of different generations and education gathered - from workers and peasants to doctors, even music and sports stars of the '80s, it was a place where nationality and religious affiliation played no role. Nevertheless, the first shooting between Serbs and Croats took place in \"Jablan\", which heralded the war in Croatia and ended \"Jablan's carefree days\". The film protagonists reconstruct the events, from the day the tavern was created, to its destruction, witnessing how a place of love and joy became an object of hatred and destruction within a few months.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":83800,"logo_path":"/qAIl2gCsGw3jnMbE6lGaHex7jie.png","name":"Restart","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":117482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Talas
