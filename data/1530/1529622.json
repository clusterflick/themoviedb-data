But after a recent drought severely damaged the crops, Shaira’s grandfather sells her horse without telling her. One day, he tells Shaira that the reason why some clouds take the shape of animals is that the sky traps them and won’t return them until it rains again. Shaira embarks on a journey to go in search of a special seed that will make the heavens rain again to bring her horse back.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2025-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Semillas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10460810","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
