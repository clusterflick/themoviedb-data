The project centers in Manchuria in the early twentieth century, a time of massive population displacement driven by war colonisation as the Qing empire collapsed and a new nation was still in the making. Based on historical records and memoirs, Lee reconstructs a seven-day time period with video and creative writing, re-enacting the psychological changes and conflicts of the refugees during the long journey of escape and repatriation.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shadow Lands Yonder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5624276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Kai-Chung","original_name":"Lee Kai-Chung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689d0908b8a9d066e48ebd83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5624282,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Isaji Yugo","original_name":"Isaji Yugo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689d09538caca031505e4674","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
