The associated poem, “Dreamland,” addresses the complicated history of the role American idealism played in covering up global decimation.

How can we remember and examine the past to forge a better future?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreamland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4477295,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tehya Jennett","original_name":"Tehya Jennett","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689b6c5e4f4665d261b70758","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4469731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxfield Biggs","original_name":"Maxfield Biggs","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689b6c68ff20fc9428c6ff40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
