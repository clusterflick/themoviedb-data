Caused by the detonation of vast quantities of ammonium nitrate improperly stored in a warehouse by the port, the blast sent powerful shockwaves through the city. The silos, located just 75 metres from the epicentre of the explosion, became a site of ruin.  Since the explosion, these ruins have loomed large in the cityâ€™s skyline as a constant reminder of the devastation that followed the blast. For some, the ruins of the silos also evoke the persistent lack of accountability for the tragedy, and are a potential source of valuable evidence.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beirut Port Explosion: Destruction of Destruction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2773522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forensic Architecture","original_name":"Forensic Architecture","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689dda938cccdcfb755e4a3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
