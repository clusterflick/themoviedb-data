Now she must confront the silence surrounding sexual violence between women and the terrifying vulnerability of learning to trust again.  The Space Between Touch is a quiet yet emotionally charged short film about the rarely discussed reality of sexual violence between women, and the courage it takes to reclaim trust after betrayal. When a tender night with her college girlfriend reopens the wound of an assault by her high school ex, Lauren is forced to navigate the shame, silence, and stigma that often surrounds queer partner abuse. Through delicate performances and intimate cinematography, the film explores what it means to be vulnerable in love, to stay present in your body after trauma, and to write a new story for yourself in the arms of someone safe.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gXFqkfSO00rHVXZ1bfKAMtem7Fx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When Lauren stumbles into bed with her girlfriend, a tender moment turns haunting as echoes of a past assault flood back.
