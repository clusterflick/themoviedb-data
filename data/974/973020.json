The film traces the girls’ naturally fraught sibling dynamic and the ways that their father’s absence ignites their imagination. When they meet a stranger in the forest they become enchanted by a world of creative work and nature, a welcome distraction from their volatile mother. Play and the dreamlike space they inhabit provides an expansive and ultimately grounding setting for the girls’ response to war.","popularity":0.536,"poster_path":"/8dRBW6SwwWNSqwpP3CL4dPeD5QD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3540588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baylen Taich","original_name":"Baylen Taich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ida","credit_id":"6276f0ab323eba1336b1e957","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3540589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pfifer Spruill","original_name":"Pfifer Spruill","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Johanna","credit_id":"6276f0bd394a8700a18a89fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2367866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hauke Bahr","original_name":"Hauke Bahr","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/s3gSGsycCq2Y5HoVa6m236QLN2V.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Father","credit_id":"6276f0c903bf840050a712d1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isolda Dychauk-Ott","original_name":"Isolda Dychauk","popularity":0.3069,"profile_path":"/u2pVocAgoj1xmHfbsLwhOfNZqC4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"6276f0d4713ea610d7b4c649","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candy Clark","original_name":"Candy Clark","popularity":0.4808,"profile_path":"/4Q3CmUrOGkdkffmwvq8aUp8dzsK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ida As An Adult (voice)","credit_id":"62fdaf8894d8a800940922c1","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3449665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thea Goodman","original_name":"Thea Goodman","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6276f114a8023614145b9633","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Fotopoulos","original_name":"James Fotopoulos","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/ppwjudnqE6NPI5GVin3t7GsoBPM.jpg","credit_id":"6276f0fce7c09700663c81cc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Fotopoulos","original_name":"James Fotopoulos","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/ppwjudnqE6NPI5GVin3t7GsoBPM.jpg","credit_id":"6276f0819979d21484933e12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6752398","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8dRBW6SwwWNSqwpP3CL4dPeD5QD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
