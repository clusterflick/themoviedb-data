A black dot in the film negative. In the nineteen eighties I enjoyed painting on 35mm blank film and painted a negative. That means every frame was painted in reverse color - black became white, blueish green became red, yellow was to be sort of blue. The result: all colors are on black background - like in the windows in old cathedrals. The music was improvised after the film was finished by Jasper van’t Hof, vocals by Eva Mattes. The film was premiered in competition at the Berlinale 1985.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sterne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Struck","original_name":"Thomas Struck","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/uLPdFwlpwbinVOXPtSwSdNjYVBb.jpg","credit_id":"66374e289590e30126bcb862","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
