Trying to survive the difficult times, people lost in the new reality often behave in a way that is far removed from the propaganda stereotypes cultivated in earlier Polish cinematography about war heroism, sacrifice and sacrifice. In fact, it is a generational saga of the Polish countryside, referring to the TV series Chłopi by J. Rybkowski, but taking place in a particularly difficult period of the 20th century.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":524,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Popielec","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0402689","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1984-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
