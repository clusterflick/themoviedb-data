When out to sea a few days, he is discovered, and is about to be disciplined, when the captain's daughter, May, intercedes. A terrific storm strikes them, and the ship is dashed to pieces. The captain, with the assistance of Jack, builds a little raft, and with little May, they set out for an island which they can hardly discern, as it is so many miles away. After drifting for many hours, they at last reach the island, which is inhabited by a savage tribe.","popularity":0.4167,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Child Crusoes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tefft Johnson","original_name":"Tefft Johnson","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":"/ioAvdqZHSTOSwZcVeNamE0BBAfl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Captain Rhines","credit_id":"6279b528d8d3290068699210","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Casey","original_name":"Kenneth Casey","popularity":0.0964,"profile_path":"/80nGT9KLVWl0w0Cyh6tg9Tz4JCf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jack - A Young Stowaway","credit_id":"6279b53aa7e363009c332e74","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1110482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adele DeGarde","original_name":"Adele DeGarde","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/frdVYPfQMeCaygDxTwSnetDCPsg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"May - The Captain's Daughter","credit_id":"6279b548d8d32900686992b2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Delaney","original_name":"Leo Delaney","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/f6Ajp3bC0iJwyzkWOEYuWxMGwmq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6279b557160e730067acb88e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norma Talmadge","original_name":"Norma Talmadge","popularity":0.1066,"profile_path":"/h8ES1kk8EEByz34sKaWMDyB6Ntv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6279b55af6fd1800673d3f48","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Ince","original_name":"Ralph Ince","popularity":0.1863,"profile_path":"/73Dd6TNh5Ji2JQsj63JoxJ53sbo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6279b565abdec000676ee23e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Storey","original_name":"Edith Storey","popularity":0.1884,"profile_path":"/r8iO5KZFDf3V7o13KWlB67iuWZK.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6279b56f211ce500662eb775","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1047595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helene Costello","original_name":"Helene Costello","popularity":0.1336,"profile_path":"/3SvCiydhPLPyQtWIoEQtsRoBYt.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6279b57c07291c00656ee8be","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolores Costello","original_name":"Dolores Costello","popularity":0.2072,"profile_path":"/xEsZUdwjqZdIWi2yWDo8mC6Ugt0.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6279b589f6fd180051eeb303","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1391868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Shea","original_name":"William Shea","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/Ag5IBOVM6UhMnSjsSMoZWLGb80V.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6279b59507216600510faa8f","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van Dyke Brooke","original_name":"Van Dyke Brooke","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/srLqffFE7o3SrBJPFwf9zLRb5g8.jpg","credit_id":"6279b50d168ea3009acd5034","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3543264,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marison Ziegfeld","original_name":"Marison Ziegfeld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6279b5192f8d09009dfcbf91","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0001543","wikidata_id":"Q3986256","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3622,"name":"stowaway"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1911-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
