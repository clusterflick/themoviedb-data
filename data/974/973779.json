Flowers, plants and textures were photographed in places such as nature conservatories, cultivated gardens, vacant properties and parking lots. The familiar landscape appears molten, luminous and renewed. Ad meliora is suggestive of adaptation, resilience and transformation.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":"/4T1lqX53VicBvPamhBdHMCwr6R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ad meliora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3542700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Escalante-Chernova","original_name":"Irina Escalante-Chernova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627944d6323eba5245b590d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3542700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Escalante-Chernova","original_name":"Irina Escalante-Chernova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627944dcaa659e13e6917960","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2295125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Balsley","original_name":"Kate Balsley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627944c867e0f7536956ac6c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2295125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Balsley","original_name":"Kate Balsley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6279447272d8551306a911de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4T1lqX53VicBvPamhBdHMCwr6R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Wisconsin Film Festival","release_date":"2022-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
