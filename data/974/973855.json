Feeling pressured to present himself as an erudite artist, Leslie decides to live out the premise of his own film. When questioned about the influence of Hong Sang-soo’s films in his work during an interview, Leslie denies the influence, and instead cites a fictional Korean director named Yoo Un-sung as an influence in order to build a persona as somebody who champions underground cinema; he also takes other people’s ideas, and passes them off as his own during Q&A’s. Everything seems to have gone well... until a few months later when, at another Q&A event, a woman named Kristen Kim shows up to ask where she can find Yoo Un-sung’s films.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heaven or Las Vegas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3580552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jawni Han","original_name":"Jawni Han","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Leslie","credit_id":"62a021dd53866e00519817d8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1914946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristen Yoonsoo Kim","original_name":"Kristen Yoonsoo Kim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kristen","credit_id":"62a0220d1130bd00504d99b1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3580554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Gris","original_name":"Virginia Gris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Liv","credit_id":"62a0222ba8b2ca0050dd42de","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3580552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jawni Han","original_name":"Jawni Han","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a0228fd100b6009ad2a56f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
