Her neighboring village, Seok-ju, loves Soon-i. However, as Yeong-dal's scheme makes it difficult to make a living for sewing, Soon-i becomes Yeong-dal's concubine. Sewing, who saved her foundation thanks to her daughter, opened the tavern she had always dreamed of. However, Soon-i leaves a letter without saying a word and she leaves for Pyongyang. After a while, a large sum of 150 won was remitted from her Soon-i. There she became a whore. When Seong-bong learns of her, he takes her Seok-ju and goes to find her. However, the way to pay off her 500 won debt was vague. On a rainy night, Seong-joo robs her pawnshop and gives Seok-joo a bundle of stolen money and collapses. But it was a piece of her newspaper and she felt relieved that she was freed from sin. In front of Se-bong, the happy wedding scene between Seok-ju and Soon-i comes to mind.","popularity":0.1786,"poster_path":"/6RqL7UlfxGfSu46oPeZbqD84hpA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175035,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chun-il
