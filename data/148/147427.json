As the days pass, unexplainable things begin to happen. Any item put in the box disappears. Wishes, or something resembling wishes, start getting granted. People outside of the group begin disappearing. They begin finding messages in books and magazines; messages that suggest something far more sinister may be at work.  When her friends begin to disappear, Eleanor realizes she has to stop whatever is literally tearing her friends apart. The Many Monsters of Sadness is a light hearted film that takes a turn towards darkness, suspense, and drama, about the price of getting everything you want.","popularity":0.187,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17398,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paper Ghost Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A girl and her friends discover a mysterious box that many of them think has the ability to grant wishes, but as every 'granted wish' is fulfilled, something horrible happens in return.","title":"The Many Monsters of Sadness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":936491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brittany Belland","original_name":"Brittany Belland","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/rDAcOMwtsxGxkUihEkck6PjtbuQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Zoe","credit_id":"52fe4ba59251416c751099b1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1262746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Motke Dapp","original_name":"Motke Dapp","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ba59251416c751099b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1262747,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ryan Hartsock","original_name":"Ryan Hartsock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ba59251416c751099bd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2336507","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":193400,"name":"teen drama"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Many Monsters of Sadness Feature Film Trailer","key":"l3kFJyoPbHE","published_at":"2011-11-30T22:01:53.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6f8c3a36854480099fc"}]}}}
