We see the most precious film sequences that we all remember: From Citizen Kane to Star Wars, from Some Like It Hot to E.T. The incredible short cuts of roughly a second each push the audience into a kind of trance and take them on a journey into their individual memories of great films of the 20th century. The film won an Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film.","popularity":0.1871,"poster_path":"/2pDZf4A6U46yuVMvgO4egnkUNNa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Precious Images","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":22,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chuck Workman","original_name":"Chuck Workman","popularity":0.1077,"profile_path":"/u2a7WwcD42kTDXWLAFo888kskkq.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b9b9251416c75108607","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0091787","wikidata_id":"Q1939927","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2pDZf4A6U46yuVMvgO4egnkUNNa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/71AgSjNT80KR0cdQg8Nbh7mHDrT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
