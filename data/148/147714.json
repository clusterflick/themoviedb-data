Mørk has long revolved around his own problems with feelings of guilt for the failed marriage. Lone, one of his daughter's friends, makes a strong impression on him, and soon something will begin to develop between them. This awakening leads him to resume his relationship with his ex-wife. This especially affects his daughter Eva, who has been afraid to commit because she is a child of divorced parents.","popularity":0.3116,"poster_path":"/1RpeKnbDk04bGimruNGoUw8Ieck.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14623,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teamfilm AS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1965-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unexpected Summer","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henki Kolstad","original_name":"Henki Kolstad","popularity":0.2699,"profile_path":"/aRRygnoVMeT48vr8qgUkDALFitc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Johannes Mørk, forfatter","credit_id":"52fe4bb09251416c7510aef5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tone Danielsen","original_name":"Tone Danielsen","popularity":0.1474,"profile_path":"/toKLCByR3MXEG1Dw05eLVzrXBTm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Eva Mørk, datter av Johannes","credit_id":"52fe4bb09251416c7510aef9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":226161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Solfrid Heier","original_name":"Solfrid Heier","popularity":0.5365,"profile_path":"/nas7SWVEa0AnztGnTI3Pm1ODkvH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lone","credit_id":"52fe4bb09251416c7510aefd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":226225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wenche Sandnæs","original_name":"Wenche Sandnæs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Marit","credit_id":"52fe4bb09251416c7510af01","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Remlov","original_name":"Kai Remlov","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/rTNt3qjs0IzWmLywUvOCSZwNQPf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Carsten, Evas venn","credit_id":"52fe4bb19251416c7510af05","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":226219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Henrik Størmer","original_name":"Carl Henrik Størmer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Einar, Lones kjæreste","credit_id":"5a884d369251410ac404eda5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1734355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Andreassen","original_name":"John Andreassen","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Kalle, Marits kjæreste","credit_id":"5a884d74c3a36862e1051820","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1271153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Synnøve Gleditsch","original_name":"Synnøve Gleditsch","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Fru Ås, Marits mor","credit_id":"5a884d9b0e0a2653b3051fd7","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Knut Andersen","original_name":"Knut Andersen","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":"/9CO7Rhude8d8ntdlbZcDjql3N7e.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bb09251416c7510aef1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1749194,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mattis Mathiesen","original_name":"Mattis Mathiesen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a884c8a0e0a2652ab050e14","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1308594,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Egil Monn-Iversen","original_name":"Egil Monn-Iversen","popularity":0.0501,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a884cb3c3a36862a704cf3f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tancred Ibsen","original_name":"Tancred Ibsen","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":"/wzLGRq0NIJScvnqZxbfzqVsfaDJ.jpg","credit_id":"5a884cf2c3a3682dbf0586e8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980022,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arthur Omre","original_name":"Arthur Omre","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a885a790e0a2652ab051fe4","department":"Writing","job":"Short Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0254778","wikidata_id":"Q12001075","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aekK4YpjxeTTGZZtYFFc09IvykC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/1RpeKnbDk04bGimruNGoUw8Ieck.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
