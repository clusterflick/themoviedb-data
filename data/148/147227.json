But the Russian world champ beats Tommy Rosemund's masterwork in a televised match. So the West German mathematician becomes a top chess pro himself, which the West German media boast will prove the superiority of Germany and democracy. The jowly, white-faced Rosemund believes that the entire Red Communist bloc is out to stop him from vanquishing their atheist pretty boy, Stefan Koruga, to become the next Bobby Fischer and a symbol that capitalism is preferable to socialism.","popularity":0.6208,"poster_path":"/dmcZY7dfeXbeyCpMYX3o8IHwi19.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7348,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monaco Film
