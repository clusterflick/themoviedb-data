Money runners and assassins for a powerful drug lord, they know way too much to just wash their hands and walk away from all the violence, death and destruction.  But when Rachel is brutally murdered in a drug deal gone bad, June calls it quits and takes to the open road for survival. Escape isn't that easy, and her life becomes a living hell as she is sadistically \"persuaded\" by the FBI into setting up her ex-boss. Forced back into the game, yet driven by a righteous code of honor and a killer's instinct, June finds herself at the dead end of a one-way street ... from which the only way out is with both guns blazing!","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bullets are a girl's best friend","title":"One Girl, 2 Guns","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0200926","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
