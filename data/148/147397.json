In the first place, it is full life-size. Secondly, it is the only accurate recent portrait of the great inventor. The scene is an actual one, showing Mr. Edison in working dress engaged in an interesting chemical experiment in his great Laboratory. There is sufficient movement to lead the spectator through the several processes of mixing, pouring, testing, etc. as if he were side by side with the principal. The lights and shadows are vivid, and the apparatus and other accessories complete a startling picture that will appeal to every beholder.” (Edison Catalog)","popularity":0.3284,"poster_path":"/fY6irlW1MhynSvKOzkFdzVo1IXQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1897-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mr. Edison at Work in His Chemical Laboratory","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":37,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Edison a laboratóriumában dolgozik","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Господин Эдисон за работой в химической лаборатории","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239027,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas A.
