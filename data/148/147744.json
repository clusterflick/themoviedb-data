Gaye included this performance as part of a European tour. Gaye performs a majority of his hits from his recent disco-funk hits \"Got to Give It Up\" and \"A Funky Space Reincarnation\", to his duet hits with Tammi Terrell including \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" and \"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\", in which Gaye re-interpolated the songs as a somber tribute to Terrell, who died over a decade before, to sixties Motown classics such as \"I'll Be Doggone\", \"Ain't That Peculiar\", \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\" and \"I Heard It through the Grapevine\", to seventies standards such as \"What's Going On\", \"Trouble Man\" and \"Let's Get It On\". The Montreux set was later released as a CD/DVD in 2003.","popularity":0.428,"poster_path":"/69x3Ij23FElVkOCLI6nIfdAushT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marvin Gaye - Live In Montreux 1980","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marvin Gaye","original_name":"Marvin Gaye","popularity":0.1395,"profile_path":"/9Su0b4zeVTFCPiMesBb7Xv8goEO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4bb29251416c7510b13b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230196,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claude Nobs","original_name":"Claude Nobs","popularity":0.1268,"profile_path":"/jPPr8Ht6JMv174ILJD1iPQ9isgq.jpg","credit_id":"654936b6d55c3d00ff96d701","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uRyg1cZ9kL0MZgsywHSYdOiuQeL.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1404,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/69x3Ij23FElVkOCLI6nIfdAushT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4344,"name":"musical"},{"id":4744,"name":"motown"},{"id":11634,"name":"live performance"},{"id":156205,"name":"concert film"},{"id":198299,"name":"live music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Marvin Gaye - Let's Get It On Live In Montreux 1980","key":"kaJtTRlxovU","published_at":"2012-05-10T12:21:47.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"533ec6f8c3a3685448009a1d"}]}}}
