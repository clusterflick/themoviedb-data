We went to his village in Kurdistan, a region brought to a standstill by war. At this place, loving someone can become confused with having a hold over them. It is with humor that the characters featured in this film find ways, within their community, to affirm that they truly exist. A shaman goes into trance in front of the television, a hermit dreams of marriage, a shepherdess wants to leave the top of the mountain, soldiers watch over the village, a man from Europe goes off to request the hand of a young woman. It is through these situations that we discover the reality of families doing what they can to find a way of living together, to take the best – or the worst – from each moment.","popularity":0.0547,"poster_path":"/mJftSvtQCKXGmwe7Cxsb3zs16Gt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kurdish Lover","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1126241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clarisse Hahn","original_name":"Clarisse Hahn","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/zrTjOvFv78akVCru1uevFuBAQ6q.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bae9251416c7510aac7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1783316","wikidata_id":"Q108542987","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/mJftSvtQCKXGmwe7Cxsb3zs16Gt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/j9z44eUEbyGYc1k5uTRZtX8WPd5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
