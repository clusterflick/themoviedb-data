Turns out, they're looking for the audience, and when George spots the camera, they start in on their patter. Gracie wants to convince George that she's smart, not dizzy - it's an uphill struggle of which she's blissfully unaware. Midway through, they break into song: \"Do You Believe Me?\" It includes a little bit of hoofing as the chatting continues. They end on a story Gracie whispers into George's ear.","popularity":0.1889,"poster_path":"/kNZzpauD6hsac12KMx2h1Y2jCqx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9329,"logo_path":"/aue5pVfj9TcjYEOufkcuCbAL5hE.png","name":"The Vitaphone Corporation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
