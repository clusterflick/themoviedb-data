The film shows Leonard Coatsworth leaving the bridge after exiting his car. In 1998, The Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. This footage is still shown to engineering, architecture, and physics students as a cautionary tale. Elliott's original film of the construction and collapse of the bridge was shot at 16 frames a second, on 16mm Kodachrome film, but most copies in circulation are in black and white because newsreels of the day copied the film onto 35 mm black-and-white stock (not to mention, often showed the film at the wrong speed).","popularity":0.2179,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76706,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Camera Shop, Tacoma","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3396063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Burt Farquharson","original_name":"Frederick Burt Farquharson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61eed06902842000698723f6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barney Elliott","original_name":"Barney Elliott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617844dfcf4b8b0042939725","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3396064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harbine Monroe","original_name":"Harbine Monroe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61eed07f02842000f0911b62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0178922","wikidata_id":"Q64761083","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":225580,"name":"tacoma bridge"},{"id":225581,"name":"tacoma"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1940-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
