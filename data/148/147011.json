Iosseliani presents the history of this former Soviet republic through beautifully interwoven images of landscapes, artwork and clips from other Georgian filmmakers such as Nikoloz Shengalaya and Tenghiz Abuladze. He illuminates the part played recently by two politicians, both KGB men but with very different destinies: Zviad Gamsakhurdia, an ultranationalistic demagogue who died in exile; and Eduard Shevardnadze, who is the president of Georgia today.","popularity":0.1517,"poster_path":"/6Z23gz9h6BACXRJLcuGfidgHSLr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1995-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":236,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Georgia, Alone","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otar Iosseliani","original_name":"Otar Iosseliani","popularity":0.2126,"profile_path":"/vPJoqbfaj9x9YiwyrMa8liLi7J9.jpg","credit_id":"62dcfaa2c50ad200da4d96d5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1489496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nugzar Erkomaishvili","original_name":"Nugzar Erkomaishvili","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dcfab00d9f5a004fc249b2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otar Iosseliani","original_name":"Otar Iosseliani","popularity":0.2126,"profile_path":"/vPJoqbfaj9x9YiwyrMa8liLi7J9.jpg","credit_id":"54a585fe9251414e2800f5b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0111130","wikidata_id":"Q12098062","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":832,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/6Z23gz9h6BACXRJLcuGfidgHSLr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
