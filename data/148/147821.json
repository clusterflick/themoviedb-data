This is a film record of his most controversial creation: the crucifixion of a young woman, the disembowelling of a lamb carcass, and her defilement with it.  —Peter Gorsen, Sexualaesthetik, 1972","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1970-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria-Conception-Action: Hermann Nitsch","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1126691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irm Sommer","original_name":"Irm Sommer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bb59251416c7510b81d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1126690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Sommer","original_name":"Ed Sommer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bb59251416c7510b817","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2034735","wikidata_id":"Q122661848","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":228503,"name":"aktionskunst"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1970-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
