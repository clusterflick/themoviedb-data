Armed with nothing but a hand-drawn map, he heads off on an adventure like no other – quickly realising that he has a lot of catching up to do…  This riotous re-telling of Robert Louis Stevenson’s adventure novella is jam-packed with 20th century pop music and 18th century romance. Performed by a dynamic ensemble of actor-musicians, Kidnapped is a colourful coming-of-age story - shot-through with Stevenson’s trademark blend of poetry, humour and heart.  Join Davie as he navigates murderous foes, Jacobite outlaws and the most inept crew of pirates this side of the Atlantic on a journey of eye-opening discovery and treasures untold.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A swashbuckling rom-com adventure","title":"Kidnapped","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4810060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan J Mackay","original_name":"Ryan J Mackay","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Davie Balfour","credit_id":"68fe1aae05b75544d2a30c7a","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
