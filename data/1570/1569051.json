On the pretext of paying back a gambling debt, Tom brings \"Kid\" Hogan to the house, but ends up shooting him in the forearm. Dan Hogan, Kid's brother who is a policeman, rushes to the scene and catches Tom running away. To avoid arrest, Tom tells Dan that he fired at Kid for molesting Nell, and in the face of scandal, Dan and Kid back down. As revenge, Kid enlists Mamie, his girlfriend, to force Nell into a compromising situation with a man on a street corner. Conveniently placed, Dan arrests Nell for solicitation, but Frank Roberts, her boyfriend, arrives and extricates her. When Tom hears of the plot, he confronts Kid in a dance hall and soon a raging gun battle breaks out in which Kid is killed. Badly wounded, Tom seeks refuge with Nell, who prepares to protect him with his gun. As the police break down her door, Tom dies.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/zCbIkoPeezaIOpGhn0gRKrg8tk9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rolfe Photoplays","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rose of the Alley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1127086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Miles Minter","original_name":"Mary Miles Minter","popularity":0.4327,"profile_path":"/9iGZ1wyTXBHb4GRIE90dT5wP2zN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nell Drogan","credit_id":"68fdeb21851733089e92716f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5774076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Hogan","original_name":"Danny Hogan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"'Kid' Hogan","credit_id":"68fdeb5ce05b875d22bbf0bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Heck","original_name":"Frederick Heck","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dan Hogan","credit_id":"68fdeb79b309e5bae29fae8c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5774077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geraldine Berg","original_name":"Geraldine Berg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mamie","credit_id":"68fdeb950d848a9c549fae03","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Edwards","original_name":"Alan Edwards","popularity":0.4502,"profile_path":"/90jqkrCXh0jlTq5snv3cuFZh7Fl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Frank Roberts","credit_id":"68fdec2167ed119f56275fae","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Carrigan","original_name":"Thomas Carrigan","popularity":0.3096,"profile_path":"/e02ehfZ3DXSMCQVQRPS9Fvv2adZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tom Drogan","credit_id":"68fdec470a801e3fcea30bb8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192703,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Horan","original_name":"Charles Horan","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fdec9bc6f47d6cff9fad24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29250,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harry O.
