With a penchant for silliness and mockery, their performances jabbed at everything from rival teams and political figures to the University itself. Ultimately, it was this anything-goes approach to antics and jokes that led to their permanent barring from all university events in 2003.  Years in the making, co-directors Chris Farina (World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements) and Bill Reifenberger’s documentary tracks the rise and fall of the Pep Band, piecing together its madcap legacy through the accounts of former members, administrators, and fans. Traversing decades of controversy and comedy, the film is full of heart and spirit, and even offers one final performance from the irrepressible ensemble that refused to play by the rules.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":278489,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rosalia Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Rise and Fall of The Award-Winning University of Virginia Fighting Cavaliers, Indoor/Outdoor, Precision?
