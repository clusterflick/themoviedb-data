Left alone with her father, Bess begins to long for feminine companionship, and when an opportunity arises for Bess to visit her newly-remarried mother, her father consents. The little girl soon finds herself in a fairytale world of beautiful gowns and extravagant luxury. Believing that anything her mother does must be correct, Bess soon learns to smoke and drink, much to the displeasure of Kirke Livingston, who loves her but fears she has inherited her mother's weaknesses. Bess disregards his warnings until one day she finds her mother embracing another man. Disillusioned, she departs immediately for her father's cabin, traveling through the woods all night. At daybreak, Kirke finds her and wins her hand in marriage.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sunset Trail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Melford","original_name":"George Melford","popularity":0.7149,"profile_path":"/aV70vLKnT7p3mVk1CehvMIXq7T1.jpg","credit_id":"68fe936c5ff7b06155bbf486","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0008642","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1917-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
