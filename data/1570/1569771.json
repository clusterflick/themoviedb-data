I tried to capture an essential part of this city: the movement.  There are plenty of things that happen in this place and the energy is tangible.  The editing was almost completely done during the shootings and the processing of the film (Adox) was home made by my self with the Adrian Cousin's Caffenol formula.  The home made processing gives indeterminacy of the results, the yellowish colours of the image is generated by the type of developer.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/t5Ofq2zcj2mzuGuUEdD3xVQ1QUT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London Movement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3152094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franco Consales","original_name":"Franco Consales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ff7d90ef417f1ec1eab5bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2550,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t5Ofq2zcj2mzuGuUEdD3xVQ1QUT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
