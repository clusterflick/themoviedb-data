Dyna comes from a supportive family that encourages her aspirations, while Arangbi’s widowed mother struggles to run a pan shop and faces societal ridicule over her daughter’s career. The two women work as background dancers in local music videos, pushing themselves to excel in an environment where they are often invisible and misunderstood.  As an audition for a coveted lead dancer role approaches, cracks begin to form in their friendship. Dyna's privilege and Arangbi's mounting frustrations collide, exposing deep-seated fears, insecurities, and societal judgments that plague their lives. The aftermath of the audition leaves them questioning their dreams and the price of pursuing a passion in a world that refuses to accept them.  The story culminates in an open-ended epilogue, forcing the audience to ponder: Do dreams fade, or do we give up on them too soon?","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":206756,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cicada Film Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2025-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Step","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5774239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rabina kolom","original_name":"Rabina kolom","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Arangbi","credit_id":"68fe0a7b57d342cdefd9fdec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5774242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daina Laitonjam","original_name":"Daina Laitonjam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dyna","credit_id":"68fe0a9b1ea91f857a9271d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5774245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Subalata Thangjam","original_name":"Subalata Thangjam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dyna's Mother","credit_id":"68fe0ad241d97f347d92711b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5774249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobo Hayum","original_name":"Bobo Hayum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Teacher","credit_id":"68fe0b01dab517c555275df3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5774250,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bijou Thaangjam","original_name":"Bijou Thaangjam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fe0b1e9d2ad5dd9ebbf0cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5774251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monis Lairenlakpam","original_name":"Monis Lairenlakpam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fe0b342e8c1820cebbf186","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2118200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bijou Thaangjam","original_name":"Bijou Thaangjam","popularity":0.1232,"profile_path":"/zlvbSyfcEgYyULQVdnMrWY6oIXK.jpg","credit_id":"68fe0b4ae326499bb89faf1a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5774252,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nellish Naoroibam","original_name":"Nellish Naoroibam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fe0b79d93802f8c4a30ccd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5774253,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Joyson Naoroibam","original_name":"Joyson Naoroibam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fe0b9baa6b5bbcf69fb0d3","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5709347,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bonny Ningthouja","original_name":"Bonny Ningthouja","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fe0bbc996a5f72f3eaae15","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35486829","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":284143,"name":"manipuri"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U/A 13+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
