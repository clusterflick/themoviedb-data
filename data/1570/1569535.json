Professor Giuliano Borsato (Martijn Jansen) and his assistant Sofia Barboni (Nana Hilarius) make their way through the – rather Dutch-looking – vegetation. Barsato has barely explained that they are searching for the secret of eternal youth when he is attacked by a zombie: \"Damn, that hurts! Can you bandage me up?\"  In \"28 Giorni Doppo,\" police inspector Gianfranco Girolami (Simon Alderliesten) and his eternal enemy Pupo Rigate (Dirk Jan Hendriks), a reporter for the Lavabo Gazette, are confronted with the consequences. The irascible inspector (\"Nobody calls me a failed Baantjer!\") witnesses the mysterious death of the brother of the recently disappeared professor during an occult séance. Elsewhere in the city, a masked man is tearing the entrails out of young women.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What could possibly go wrong?
