May 25th saw the highest precipitation in Barcelona, while not ending the drought, did slow it down. On that day, we extracted climate data from the Meteorological Service of Catalonia, Meteocat, and transformed it into Generative RAIN: an audiovisual experiment that generates stories automatically using artificial intelligence (AI) models.
