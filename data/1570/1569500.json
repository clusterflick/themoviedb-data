By narrative, charts and acted episodes, the film dramatizes the fact that, with public school enrollments bigger than ever before, and constantly growing, the U.S. has fewer public-school teachers than it had in 1939. Of these teachers many are pitifully ill-trained “emergency” amateurs. (The film shows the too common spectacle of a teacher unable to work a problem she has given students.) Still others are psychologically unfit to teach (the film shows a stupid teacher calling a pupil stupid).","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":58987,"logo_path":null,"name":"Time Inc.
