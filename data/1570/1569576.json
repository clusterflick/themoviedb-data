The only thing that keeps them going are the small roles they’ve consistently booked in New York’s off-broadway theatre scene. But when they both fail to land good roles for the upcoming season, the future looks bleak. With no alternative, the actors decide they’re going to do the only thing that will get them back in the game: they’re going to become playwrights and write a new play with the biggest, longest, most dramatic scenes possible. And, most importantly, they’ll cast themselves.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theatre People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38780239","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/63wAwdsGTgM3StKqaDKXqLyV63G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Austin Film Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
