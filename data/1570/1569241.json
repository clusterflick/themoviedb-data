They have some minor differences; Drake is a cocky slacker while Kia is studious and polite. However, the big thing that keeps them apart is only skin-deep; Drake is white, and Kia is Hmong. They both understand and accept the dissimilitude, but there are few who share their casual attitude. Parents, friends, students and community members all apply pressure to keep Drake and Kia apart.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Symbioses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
