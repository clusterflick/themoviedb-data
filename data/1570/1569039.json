The child is cared for at the station, where the men christen her Periwinkle. Living near the station are Ephraiam Rawlins and his childless daughter Ann, a widow with maternal longings. Joyously, Ann takes charge of Periwinkle and raises the girl as her own. Grown to adulthood, Periwinkle is the bright spot for the men at the station. One day, Richard Langdon Evans, a dissolute, wealthy young New Yorker, is cast ashore from the wreck of his yacht. Periwinkle, aiding the lifesavers, helps bring him back to life. Her innocent goodness and faith transform Dick from a carousing society ne'er-do-well to a man of noble ambitions. Thus rehabilitated, Dick wins Periwinkle's hand in marriage.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/q5vJMcEzq3rldM8GVtGPKtzRC0x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7486,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Periwinkle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1127086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Miles Minter","original_name":"Mary Miles Minter","popularity":0.4327,"profile_path":"/9iGZ1wyTXBHb4GRIE90dT5wP2zN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Periwinkle","credit_id":"68fde40c476972682b275d9e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Fisher","original_name":"George Fisher","popularity":0.2177,"profile_path":"/gK8RRwzwBGksl3laSh0ALzH2E4F.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Richard Langdon Evans","credit_id":"68fde44a7c3099dc61eaac19","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Howard","original_name":"Arthur Howard","popularity":0.0411,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jim Curran","credit_id":"68fde4d6436fd2a4cf2aa5ec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Burton","original_name":"Clarence Burton","popularity":1.7879,"profile_path":"/wAyi9mSaRyMSKfclF13XeIiRZj3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sam Coffin","credit_id":"68fde818d3bdef8364bbf149","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Forrest","original_name":"Allan Forrest","popularity":0.5972,"profile_path":"/jhGHhMlLlprXT3VBQuvVHFw9Ht1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ira","credit_id":"68fde83b8b9e1d0169275e46","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harvey Clark","original_name":"Harvey Clark","popularity":0.6851,"profile_path":"/mRxpnLg6ybAnFCoEOu3sK6b8hMV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Captain Sears","credit_id":"68fde87e47f925a8e03bf875","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Periolat","original_name":"George Periolat","popularity":0.466,"profile_path":"/jlOUreCPiOjUx7NuuC2ExwDttLH.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ephraim Rawlins","credit_id":"68fde8a058f46bb30e9faf30","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Schaefer","original_name":"Anne Schaefer","popularity":0.3812,"profile_path":"/9qRdeDOGNal4hgTZhWJ7OhLwMvG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ann Scudder","credit_id":"68fde8c5436fd2a4cf2aa5ff","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4891744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Ahearn","original_name":"George Ahearn","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mortimer Hale","credit_id":"68fde8edef417f1ec1eaad63","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":296085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Kirkwood","original_name":"James Kirkwood","popularity":1.9412,"profile_path":"/svL7O0IG1wHWXr9BUIolCWkKeeN.jpg","credit_id":"68fde4646096e11fceeaab54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569638,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julian La Mothe","original_name":"Julian La Mothe","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fde929f5295e9dfa2aa76e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3289822,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William F.
