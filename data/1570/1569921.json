Through this duality, and starting from a shared but at the same time individual process, the directors seek to understand at what point the short film they are making together reaches its “sweet spot”. In other words, the ideal point at which the work is considered finished.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/h7PrODGNYZdLAqh0joq5G1xCaGN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":278572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Os Filmes do Pinguim","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweet Spot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5777485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Ribeiro","original_name":"Jorge Ribeiro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jorge Ribeiro (voice)","credit_id":"68ffbf1b67ed119f562765a4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1850544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulo Patrício","original_name":"Paulo Patrício","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xqPn5egVY3ugs8h3NTtmkTfrJts.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Paulo Patrício (voice)","credit_id":"68ffbf3adc8597cee4a63557","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5777485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Ribeiro","original_name":"Jorge Ribeiro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ffbc9d5f7acb181fa310bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1850544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulo Patrício","original_name":"Paulo Patrício","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xqPn5egVY3ugs8h3NTtmkTfrJts.jpg","credit_id":"68ffbd1f3cb5793e519277a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5777485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Ribeiro","original_name":"Jorge Ribeiro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ffbd9778cc3bf26c2aaec7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5777509,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ricardo Adrêgo","original_name":"Ricardo Adrêgo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ffbdba78988b57aeeab3dd","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1415,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h7PrODGNYZdLAqh0joq5G1xCaGN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":296721,"name":"experimental animation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
