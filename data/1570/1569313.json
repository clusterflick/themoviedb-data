One night, he meets Mika, a charismatic waitress outside a drag club, who invites him into a world unlike anything he’s known. There, Fabio becomes captivated by the performance of Diablera, a daring drag queen, and that sets off his journey of self-discovery. Fabio dives into the vibrant drag scene and begins performing secretly as “FabioLa.” But when his father uncovers the truth, tensions rise, forcing Fabio to choose between acceptance and authenticity.
