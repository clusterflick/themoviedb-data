When boarder Clem Hale, president of the freshman class, is the victim of a prank played by several of his classmates, Lavender rescues him and the two fall in love. Clem's guardian, Horace Weatherburn, becomes concerned about his ward's adoration for a \"commoner\" and arrives to break up their romance. Ruth, who recognizes Washburn as Lavender's real father and the man who brought her sister grief, strongly opposes the match and sends Lavender off to boarding school. Upon learning that Clem is seriously ill, Lavender runs away to comfort her sweetheart and, in her plight, faints by the side of the road. Weatherburn finds her and is so touched by her concern, that he relents his previous disapproval. Ruth then reveals Lavender's parentage to her father who offers his blessing to the couple.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/7GSPKzh6OjUmUoatBYgmD4BilkE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Realart Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweet Lavender","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1127086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Miles Minter","original_name":"Mary Miles Minter","popularity":0.4327,"profile_path":"/9iGZ1wyTXBHb4GRIE90dT5wP2zN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lavender","credit_id":"68fdfa09374de357362aaa13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Ashton","original_name":"Sylvia Ashton","popularity":0.4619,"profile_path":"/s18TRWa31RZYb5CUkFAQRhlt0TR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dotty Driscoe","credit_id":"68fe39fbe356753ca92aa90e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.M.
