At 26, he seemingly had his whole life ahead  of him. On November 10th, 1985 Pelle crashed his Porsche in Somerdale, NJ  and died the following day. Two others survived the accident. \"The Swede  of Philadelphia\" is an in-depth and intense look at the \"goalie, the man,  the decision.\" Acclaimed director Charlie Minn(Lionsgate, ID channel and  Amazon Prime video) interviews many of Pelle's teammates, team staff and  journalists to shape every aspect of a hockey player that paved the way  for future European and Swedish goalies to follow their dreams into the NHL.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/roVjZQWGICxuJwYDvOOXuNmPcVy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132843,"logo_path":null,"name":"Double Wave
