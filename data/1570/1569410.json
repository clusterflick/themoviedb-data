On her way home, Sara rescues a young woman who is about to drown herself. Believing the woman, Hetty Castleton, to be the murderer, Sara offers her employment in the Wrandall home as her companion. Because her husband and his family treated her so coldly during her married life, Sara seeks revenge by arranging a romance between her brother-in-law Leslie and Hetty, but the latter has fallen in love with artist Brandon Booth and refuses to marry young Wrandall. Sara threatens to expose the girl, but just then a detective appears and accuses Sara of the crime. Hetty confesses, explaining to the family that Challis had lured her to the inn and attacked her. The Wrandalls forgive her, and she leaves her home in Booth's company.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Hollow of Her Hand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Brady","original_name":"Alice Brady","popularity":1.955,"profile_path":"/v9XVx9jV7ntUKog525jrYkSnq3n.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hetty Castleton","credit_id":"68fe923858f46bb30e9fb39c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myrtle Stedman","original_name":"Myrtle Stedman","popularity":0.6432,"profile_path":"/stvYIiwLEzDgdd1OBHZT1yUVe16.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sara Wrandell","credit_id":"68ff4125d37475fe5c9273e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5776513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Clark","original_name":"Louise Clark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Wrandell","credit_id":"68ff4166a41184b054bbf6ce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.J.
