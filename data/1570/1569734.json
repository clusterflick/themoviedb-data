He dreams of moving to Europe, continuing his unfinished university life and supporting his family financially. During his time in Turkey, he works in different jobs and saves money to go to Europe. He makes several attempts to cross into Europe via Greece, but each time he is beaten and sent back to Turkey. Salmane, who disappeared on the day his documentary was shot, is never heard from again. While following Salmane's own text, the film unearths the memories he left behind with the help of the memories on his phone.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/u7SZyfmxrQrBh1kM7URokdIAe29.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":206493,"logo_path":null,"name":"Memoria Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2025-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salman Wants To Go","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5776758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amadou Faye","original_name":"Amadou Faye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"68ff6c1678988b57aeeab24e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2684047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ozan Takış","original_name":"Ozan Takış","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1KK8CTEGvDh2HOWYawmVvqmuR9C.jpg","credit_id":"68ff6c2458f46bb30e9fb750","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2684047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ozan Takış","original_name":"Ozan Takış","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1KK8CTEGvDh2HOWYawmVvqmuR9C.jpg","credit_id":"68ff6c2c49e491ef97a63489","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5049595,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bertu Yılmaz","original_name":"Bertu Yılmaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ff6c3eebbb584ca32aaecc","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3844686,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kadri Doğan","original_name":"Kadri Doğan","popularity":0.1296,"profile_path":"/tSABp0WUjBN3pVrtkoUxQf3Nrct.jpg","credit_id":"68ff6c45374de357362ab07b","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4221060,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zehra Başbülbül","original_name":"Zehra Başbülbül","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ff6c4dc43d0599e2938f07","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5776762,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Salmane El Farissy","original_name":"Salmane El Farissy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ff6c5bda74cc2954da0246","department":"Writing","job":"Dialogue"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3684901,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ahmed Hamdi Eren","original_name":"Ahmed Hamdi Eren","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ff6c64c063bd436d3bfebe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2496162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Özgürcan Uzunyaşa","original_name":"Özgürcan Uzunyaşa","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ff6c6a1abe9b9008938fe2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2528738,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Samet Önder Kök","original_name":"Samet Önder Kök","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ff6c712aecd0bc7d3bfdc1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2528738,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Samet Önder Kök","original_name":"Samet Önder Kök","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ff6c7841d97f347d9275a2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3025555,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ciwan Zengin","original_name":"Ciwan Zengin","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ff6c8101111bb7cada012a","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u7SZyfmxrQrBh1kM7URokdIAe29.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"31. dokumentART European Film Festival","release_date":"2025-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Salman Wants To Go - Trailer","key":"1061241348","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-02-28T12:59:24.000Z","id":"68ff6ffb32f918ebdaa31135"}]}}}
