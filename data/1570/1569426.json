But with over 80% of the UK population calling these areas home, this playful yet empathetic short film challenges enduring stereotypes by centring the experiences and eccentricities of their numerous residents. The development of these spaces, and the narratives surrounding them, has been captured over the past 100 years by early filmmakers, citizen journalists, amateur documentarians and, most recently, a growing charge of online moving image creators â€“ all brought together here to reveal the multiple identities and realities underneath the cultural image.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Song of the Suburbs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Graham Williamson","original_name":"Graham Williamson","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fe981c0d848a9c549fb23d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
