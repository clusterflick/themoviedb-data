It has a 17 part quasi-musical structure inspired by Dmitri Shostakovich's Preludes and Fugues that at times ignores the literal meaning of certain interviews for the fragrant affect of the language and body language; that is, certain interactions are left un-translated so that the viewer is given full and unfettered access to the musical spirit that animates the arguments and quarrels caught so delicately in the sound and images. - Daniel Barnett","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/aiHFEnEcQ9MFpuvvj8d8tvS5pWN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Anagram","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1507831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Barnett","original_name":"Dan Barnett","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4ef9d2a1074b7d5026f1af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9610206","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":899,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aiHFEnEcQ9MFpuvvj8d8tvS5pWN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":599}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
