Unbeknownst to most of their white passengers, porters played critical political and cultural roles, becoming trailblazers in the struggle for African American dignity and self-sufficiency, patriarchs of black labor unions, and helping give birth to the Civil Rights Movement. Ultimately, however, their greatest legacy is that which they left to future generations.","popularity":0.1622,"poster_path":"/dRbbEx6oqzriS8PNQitlVfiVHH9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21266,"logo_path":"/pqxErcacxRoOCra5IICTSvfkOT9.png","name":"AMS Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They Rose from the Rails","title":"Rising from the Rails: The Story of the Pullman Porter","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1004858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Rhodes","original_name":"Stephanie Rhodes","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/fb3K3JXIIC4z0XkmueBEBHMvqn4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Reenactor","credit_id":"6793540a16a8fe8ece238ddd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1750225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Skeen","original_name":"Jason Skeen","popularity":0.0758,"profile_path":"/5UPk6nhcNTj3rEoaI0kVPNxORGb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Reenactor","credit_id":"6793543b16a8fe8ece238dfb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Varnado","original_name":"Lawrence Varnado","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":"/455paVSfl1yQtcX5pQ6I2EJCpKv.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67935489ee91427631483cf0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2408640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Bradley","original_name":"Glenn Bradley","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Reenactor","credit_id":"679353535dd2531e8b483869","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lindsey Holloway","original_name":"Lindsey Holloway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Reenactor","credit_id":"6793537090390f48811853b2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Mason","original_name":"Evan Mason","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Reenactor","credit_id":"679353a1ee91427631483c5b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1104411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandi Price","original_name":"Brandi Price","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Reenactor","credit_id":"679353d4ee91427631483c83","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brad Osborne","original_name":"Brad Osborne","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679352f85a7d80731d185274","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0796833","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dRbbEx6oqzriS8PNQitlVfiVHH9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":668}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
