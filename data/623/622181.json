Setting off on their pilgrimage for a very humble destination, they travel along narrow country roads, and converse while listening to each other. The first one, Mili Pecherer, the director, carries on her back a both grotesque and enigmatic burden: a huge hemorrhoid-shaped bundle. As far as the second one is concerned, she is expecting a child. Understandably, here a serious and a comical approach are combined for this wandering on the foothills of the Pyrenees, open to carnival and irreverent tones under the auspices of a medieval song. As the picaresque tradition has it, this trip will give rise to meetings: with a farmer and father hosting them, with the inventor of a machine designed to find lost cats. And also a donkey, the transient travelling companion of this fanciful voyage.","popularity":0.0539,"poster_path":"/nbj1uMiC3iSICdevC4gGcpKFlXq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Glorious It Is to Be a Human Being","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mili Pecherer","original_name":"Mili Pecherer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f20cb7fcab30015c953ef","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383549,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bambou L’âne","original_name":"Bambou L’âne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f20f3a1074b7f0c272476","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mili Pecherer","original_name":"Mili Pecherer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f20937c6de33b85a539a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383548,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Geneviève Bicknell","original_name":"Geneviève Bicknell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f20b87fcab30011c954cc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383551,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"vana Gloria","original_name":"vana Gloria","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f212fa1074b7f0c27250f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mili Pecherer","original_name":"Mili Pecherer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f20a879b3d40011e9ae67","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mili Pecherer","original_name":"Mili Pecherer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f211d7fcab30012c95673","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383548,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Geneviève Bicknell","original_name":"Geneviève Bicknell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f20e10d5d8504b13df904","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826166,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arnaud Ledoux","original_name":"Arnaud Ledoux","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d95e6a44813820011da9b72","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nbj1uMiC3iSICdevC4gGcpKFlXq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
