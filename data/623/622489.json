In the summer of 1968 they take off in a caravan of 40 busses to bring the Yippie party presidential candidate, Pigasus the Pig, to Chicago. Along the way they put on free participatory carnivals for thousands in rodeo grounds, indian reservations, and colleges all across the country.","popularity":0.2319,"poster_path":"/uKVfyYyHi4F0TRmmnMaUGaGP86C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11137,"logo_path":null,"name":"Night Fire Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hog Farm Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":225351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lebrun","original_name":"David Lebrun","popularity":0.1001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6614cc065437f501847efe1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0431806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":945,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1VtOL0F7rihlavNlRjOApjxNC4S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1679}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uKVfyYyHi4F0TRmmnMaUGaGP86C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7312,"name":"road trip"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"full length - iTunes only","release_date":"2019-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
