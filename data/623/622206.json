To capture the unique sensibility of the Japanese people, the film features 170 kimono fabrics from the Muromachi to Edo periods, along with over 1,000 family crests that have been passed down through generations. These elements are presented using avant-garde visual techniques. Viewed from a modern perspective, the film transforms the exceptional patterns created by the Japanese in the past into a completely new illustrated scroll. The entire documentary contains no narration, relying solely on visuals and music to convey its message.","popularity":0.1259,"poster_path":"/aV0nGe8zvbczx9gKs778fGctGJR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1963-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mon-Yo: Ornamental Motifs from Japan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Nihon no Mon-Yo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Nihon no Moyo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Nippon no Monyo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naoya Yoshida","original_name":"Naoya Yoshida","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f38de0d5d85001340bfd5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51808,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Toru Takemitsu","original_name":"武満徹","popularity":0.2149,"profile_path":"/l48fEVb1HGMilTCkxSzYuZsSPdk.jpg","credit_id":"67fbbd45d3ab7d7a8bae17c9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550944,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kiyoshi Awazu","original_name":"粟津潔","popularity":0.1208,"profile_path":"/nh2TM8W7kUawG7d3hC4Co1poPOw.jpg","credit_id":"67fbbd62c74c16bf88ad25f5","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369598,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kohei Sugiura","original_name":"Kohei Sugiura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fbbda6aacf7cfb26994a05","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369600,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Iwai Yoshishu","original_name":"Iwai Yoshishu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fbbdd11ce4a3fb1cd91ea7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369602,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Motomasa Hanada","original_name":"Motomasa Hanada","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fbbdf6ec22ba3b49d945a6","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aV0nGe8zvbczx9gKs778fGctGJR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"Knokke Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"1963-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
