The video camera flits across the boroughs of NYC in a splash-dash sojourn of sumptuous banquets and bohemian bombast, while the down-to-earth wisdom of the seeing impaired helps to guide the protagonist into detours of wisdom befitting his putrid project. A theatrical play incubates in the balding head of the videomaker and as its presence makes itself felt among the various victims of his vision, we share with them the horror of advancing age and the descriptive diatribes toward the destiny of the decrepit damned.","popularity":0.108,"poster_path":"/yodwGUeYPSBPY2xu67s0sqeGSsd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metropolitan Monologues","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d514ac5b686b9241297ac7f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stella Kuchar","original_name":"Stella Kuchar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d514ae4b686b923f797b1ab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1279155,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah Jacobson","original_name":"Sarah Jacobson","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/9lANfumlhHuW7aDkLIH6OzWWg5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d514af2b686b923fa97a05e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1281832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philly Abe","original_name":"Philly Abe","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/oeGV2RrSLrsHAv7GoGshSYteirn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d51dc75b686b9241198bbb2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2934928,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Flanagan","original_name":"Robert Flanagan","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/1fLc4rb1jXNh3tPtnH1mqllfoOm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"self","credit_id":"64b561fa0e4fc851a0f473ba","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3101218,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Suzan Al-Doghachi","original_name":"Suzan Al-Doghachi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8ICOUmzKlFNkayhH2xWg5W9XNyQ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64b5620f78570e013a929afe","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","credit_id":"5d514b2d0102c94b1f74fe58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0464516","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1356,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yodwGUeYPSBPY2xu67s0sqeGSsd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":904}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
