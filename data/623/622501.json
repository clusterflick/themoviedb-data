Narrated by Judith’s counselor, The Bus Stops Here traps these women in a narrative in which their unmediated voices are rarely heard; instead, the viewer learns about them only through the interceding power structures of narrative, family, and psychiatric establishment. Zando chooses black and white film and a drifting camera style, intercut with home movie footage, to capture the grim struggle these sisters endure as they march toward the question of “what do I need to feel satisfied?”—a question these women must ultimately answer for themselves.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video Data
