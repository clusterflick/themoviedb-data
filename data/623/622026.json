These three plays unfold in real time and track the lives of the Gabriels throughout the coming presidential election year. To the rhythm of peeling, chopping and mixing, Hungry places us in the center of the Gabrielâ€™s kitchen. The family discusses their lives and disappointments, and the world at large and nearby. As they struggle against the fear of being left behind, the family attempts to find resilience in the face of loss.","popularity":0.9678,"poster_path":"/qh8YVI0rg05aNQWXMdxXka4ieIN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103196,"logo_path":"/eA1H91t6I1NHTsyDnmEDsk7BZbD.png","name":"BroadwayHD","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hungry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meg Gibson","original_name":"Meg Gibson","popularity":0.3531,"profile_path":"/wFtGCTXzkVhcctPENfWyGGfHVCd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Karin Gabriel","credit_id":"5d4e2b31a1074b0016276d3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2382786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynn Hawley","original_name":"Lynn Hawley","popularity":0.1039,"profile_path":"/37Fijdm8EKXGDeFflN4wWxzvDnT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hannah Gabriel","credit_id":"5d4e2b39a1074b0015275ddc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberta Maxwell","original_name":"Roberta Maxwell","popularity":0.3746,"profile_path":"/ejMmpGmtr2FbLWdSZqhMzXKJ0bG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Patricia Gabriel","credit_id":"5d4e2b427c6de336cba4cf32","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":171472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryann Plunkett","original_name":"Maryann Plunkett","popularity":0.3024,"profile_path":"/317RSmgO74AhbqcfnYbAkVKWCXh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mary Gabriel","credit_id":"5d4e2b4b7c6de336cba4cf3f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay O.
