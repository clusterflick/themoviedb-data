The Polish scientist tested boundaries of human mental resilience in extreme conditions of solitude in Antarctica. The starting point for Piotr Jaworski's documentary is the psychologist's journal. The project from forty years ago was focused on studying the mental condition of polar explorers at the Polish station. Men were in the situation of confinement, comparable to a space mission. The film reconstructs these events, referring to the then contemporary context and changes in the perception of science.","popularity":0.4817,"poster_path":"/fiF2JZxluVPRixGc97ZRpZc8zF3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42841,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmowe Kalejdoskop","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2019-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Antarctic Syndrome","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Terelak","original_name":"Jan Terelak","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d52a8bf6f974600169c47e4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piotr Jaworski","original_name":"Piotr Jaworski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d52a7696f974600159c4e64","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386189,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kamil Skałkowski","original_name":"Kamil Skałkowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d52a7efcee2f60012277441","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2386185,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zbigniew Osiński","original_name":"Zbigniew Osiński","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d52a7ce9a8a8a0016e4efe3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386182,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jarosław Konopka","original_name":"Jarosław Konopka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d52a7909a8a8a0017e4f940","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386183,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kamil Sajewicz","original_name":"Kamil Sajewicz","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d52a7a8d8e22500182f80ab","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janusz Skałkowski","original_name":"Janusz Skałkowski","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d52a7e2cee2f60014277069","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piotr Jaworski","original_name":"Piotr Jaworski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d52a759cee2f60015276af8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386184,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tomasz Bujko","original_name":"Tomasz Bujko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d52a7bd6f974600169c4596","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427273,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrzej Wojciechowski","original_name":"Andrzej Wojciechowski","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6725e7af471bb80a075310ef","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427273,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrzej Wojciechowski","original_name":"Andrzej Wojciechowski","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6725e7b9afdd34caafe6bbaf","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3252135,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Renata Łukasiak","original_name":"Renata Łukasiak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675dcc0fa8d0eb560faa450f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3772325,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maciej Ostoja-Chyżyński","original_name":"Maciej Ostoja-Chyżyński","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e84253dff0de99b616ed1","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13721952","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/fiF2JZxluVPRixGc97ZRpZc8zF3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1533,"name":"isolation"},{"id":2220,"name":"polar zone"},{"id":3556,"name":"seclusion"},{"id":8721,"name":"arctic polar circle region"},{"id":14728,"name":"antarctica"},{"id":185740,"name":"ethical dilemma"},{"id":239390,"name":"human experiment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
