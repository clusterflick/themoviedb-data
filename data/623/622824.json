Moments of joy, bonding and roughhousing on a school trip to the beach counterpoint one teen boyâ€™s introspective sexual awakenings and questionings. Magnificent cinematography and editing create a visual feast that provides the imagery for a narrated poem by Peter Laberge alluding to early homosexual desires, but with Catholic overtones never directly expressed.","popularity":0.2791,"poster_path":"/aAfEI2aujkkL56Q0eZh60vknh7P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2018-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boy
