The limited job opportunities available in their rural area have left the family mired in poverty. Zoryana becomes a hostage between her two closest people, her mother and Edgars – she must choose between her mother’s advocacy of countryside as the best place for raising a family and life in the city, which would offer more creature comforts and more opportunities to earn a living. Zoryana Horobraya sweeps us along on Zoryana’s journey, as she tries to escape the protective bubble of her mother and define her own family’s happiness and existence.","popularity":0.1287,"poster_path":"/kmBiMTiTkx7cuIhV3fn9XgpoN8r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127616,"logo_path":null,"name":"Latvijas Kultūras akadēmija","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":146706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Air Productions","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2019-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zoryana Horobraya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elita Kļaviņa","original_name":"Elita Kļaviņa","popularity":0.2006,"profile_path":"/GVSB9IeXNbu245TCKO2RriTDr8.jpg","credit_id":"5d5113aeb686b965f597b4da","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elita Kļaviņa","original_name":"Elita Kļaviņa","popularity":0.2006,"profile_path":"/GVSB9IeXNbu245TCKO2RriTDr8.jpg","credit_id":"5d5113a80102c9233e752cd8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1970185,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daiga Livčāne","original_name":"Daiga Livčāne","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5114040102c9001175e9e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297708,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sandra Alksne","original_name":"Sandra Alksne","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5113da0102c922bc752bdd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777839,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Artis Dukaļskis","original_name":"Artis Dukaļskis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5113ba0102c9276d752f5e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elita Kļaviņa","original_name":"Elita Kļaviņa","popularity":0.2006,"profile_path":"/GVSB9IeXNbu245TCKO2RriTDr8.jpg","credit_id":"5d51141f0102c9276d753097","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1648616,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Antra Gaile","original_name":"Antra Gaile","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe2e78db2e07400407352ba","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1105423,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aleksandrs Grebņevs","original_name":"Aleksandrs Grebņevs","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":"/cQ9eehyZ4ABXssfsURJ0GasO6bV.jpg","credit_id":"5fe2e7595be00e003f9e1c70","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elita Kļaviņa","original_name":"Elita Kļaviņa","popularity":0.2006,"profile_path":"/GVSB9IeXNbu245TCKO2RriTDr8.jpg","credit_id":"5fe2e73731644b003df4c286","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qSNhvnEhtkr7RTs2QMYfMm4eMUp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kmBiMTiTkx7cuIhV3fn9XgpoN8r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"lv","file_path":"/9aLZz9wqZYSuDiKuSs55I9H3Dxr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Zoryana Horobraya trailer","key":"364706674","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-07T05:06:05.000Z","id":"604f9c8b22e480006ad657c6"}]}}}
