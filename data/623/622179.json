Long shots, extremely slow all-round views, steady panning: the image patiently describes a series of urban sites and landscapes of the former German Democratic Republic (Saxony and Thuringia). Through highly elaborate arrangements of archives from different sources (police reports, survivors’ testimonies, administrative correspondence, and more), an o -screen voice establishes what these places set the stage for in March 1933: the Nazi concentration system and an elimination regime of all political opposition. Especially noteworthy, in this film, is the extremely attentive channelling towards still unknown times and geographies of the horror Hitler inflicted on the first victims: people with sympathies for communism, activists, trade unionists, socio-democratic journalists, and so on.","popularity":0.1736,"poster_path":"/fyfcGuoEKU2WLGfr7DNavzoUN5R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Status and Terrain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharina Meves","original_name":"Katharina Meves","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d4f1e527c6de3572ba43b34","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2383541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ute Adamczewski","original_name":"Ute Adamczewski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f1e1279b3d40013e9af22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2383541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ute Adamczewski","original_name":"Ute Adamczewski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f1e6b79b3d40015e9c83e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1112025,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stefan Neuberger","original_name":"Stefan Neuberger","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f1e8b7fcab30011c951c8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383542,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ludwig Berger","original_name":"Ludwig Berger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f1ea97fcab30012c95361","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2383541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ute Adamczewski","original_name":"Ute Adamczewski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4f1eb57c6de34ac3a59052","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11573800","wikidata_id":"Q90526239","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zHT8tmkAwZT2MpUmt0tUlJ2qdA1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/fyfcGuoEKU2WLGfr7DNavzoUN5R.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/1BKfOzYZa3AKQt4S6Ots8mKcCTU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1132}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
