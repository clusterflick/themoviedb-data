The narrative focuses on a snippet of her life as she wanders through an abandoned town, like so many before. She encounters traces of the people that used to live here and the lives they have led and left behind. Initially amused by her discoveries, these feelings quickly dissipate as loneliness consumes her and she finds herself aching for any kind of human interaction. The unfolding story and elements in the scenery let us know that Blake has been alone for quite some time and can't cope with the isolation anymore. She is reaching her breaking point. In a last struggle to carry on she ends up finding a most unlikely companion and together they continue the journey.","popularity":0.1497,"poster_path":"/zF83kQqjczz4Ox3b5BqIs33OGTd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88585,"logo_path":null,"name":"UCA Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A young woman roams an empty world, struggling with loneliness and a fleeting sense of humanity.","title":"Come and See","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1795523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Smitz","original_name":"Johanna Smitz","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/yQv2snNeZ5QAcDrUg1krwr4QBRE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Blake","credit_id":"5d4efaaca1074b34ef270c95","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835182,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George Pearton","original_name":"George Pearton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e3933f12cf400cd6fe7e1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835180,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Agne Steponaityte","original_name":"Agne Steponaityte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e3920f12cf4007ac7cce5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835184,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Riley Wong","original_name":"Riley Wong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e3a0bbe6d880084eb339d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Urmas Salu","original_name":"Urmas Salu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/uqyRVggG6R0VBwGs6X2ezajNn2c.jpg","credit_id":"639e3911b5400200c3b5e81c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835181,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Umi Gilbert","original_name":"Umi Gilbert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e392a4f33ad00c32bea06","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3043534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Mattinson","original_name":"Oliver Mattinson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e393b4f33ad008455726b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835183,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Liisa Höbe","original_name":"Liisa Höbe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e39ea2f3b170085db20c4","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835185,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jools Turner","original_name":"Jools Turner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e3a222f3b1700a00fd79e","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Corrine Amos","original_name":"Corrine Amos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e3a33be6d8800bca77bba","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835187,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gabriel Monteregge","original_name":"Gabriel Monteregge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e3a4ff12cf400a072ef70","department":"Production","job":"Production Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6273440","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zF83kQqjczz4Ox3b5BqIs33OGTd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Completed May 30, 2016, but formal release date is hard to find","release_date":"2016-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
