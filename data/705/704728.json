Featuring transparent confessions to the camera and eye-opening images from the past, the film examines the chasm religious identity can leave in the middle of families. As the director loses her faith, she struggles to reconcile the reality of her beliefs with the love she has for her family and friends, whose beliefs equate atheism with eternal damnation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ajX7leNapati2oFLfsrI0Wyvsty.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diary of a Teenage Zealot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Megan Liz Smith","original_name":"Megan Liz Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebf19e679b3d4001b91b934","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":773,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ajX7leNapati2oFLfsrI0Wyvsty.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
