Masters of sword and bow, driven by an unforgiving code of ethics, they proved ferocious in combat. They beat back foreign invaders and fought each other for land, status, honor and glory. The Samurai explores the extraordinary legacy of martial artistry, ceremony, self-discipline and tenacity in battle that reaches to this day. Modern-day samurai explain the ways of life in the Bushido, while scholars detail the pivotal events in their centuries-long history. From the heyday of the Heian Period (794-1185) to the inevitable decline that followed the opening of Japan in 1853, this is the definitive study of some of world's most famous fighters.","popularity":0.3373,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":133924,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greystone Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Samurai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Herrmann","original_name":"Edward Herrmann","popularity":1.0067,"profile_path":"/sO9IoAlw3CLJZT6UF35cZBcTYRV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"self (voice)","credit_id":"5ebecbcf15a4a1001e9d8be2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":953728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toshishiro Obata","original_name":"Toshishiro Obata","popularity":0.2713,"profile_path":"/ueIjJW9Nu0Pewaa8nWB9dKusn6u.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"self / swordsman","credit_id":"5ebecbde9979d2001f2abe16","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2639861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Shu","original_name":"Michael Shu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ronin 1","credit_id":"5ebecbee3d3557001cdeec8a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1526660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Wong","original_name":"James Wong","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Ronin 2","credit_id":"5ebecc029979d200212ade8a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2639860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Long","original_name":"Tony Long","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebecb609979d2001f2abd01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2639860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Long","original_name":"Tony Long","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebecb6d8e2e0000201475ac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2639860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Long","original_name":"Tony Long","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebecb736d675a00217c8a36","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1713001,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Collins","original_name":"Tom Collins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebecb819979d2001f2abd92","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2567719,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael W.
