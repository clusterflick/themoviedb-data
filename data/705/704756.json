Intimate access allows viewers into the lives of individuals impacted by the tragedy as they deal with the new wave of media attention brought to town by the anniversary.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/obdMuYzE1ZJnxzzWsFAtVRQzh9c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thoughts and Prayers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Sabatke","original_name":"Sarah Sabatke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebf209a6d675a001f7b8bd4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":773,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/obdMuYzE1ZJnxzzWsFAtVRQzh9c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
