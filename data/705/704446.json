Entrop is based on a virtual three dimensional version of such a zoetrope, using digital means to go beyond the traditional physical relation of energy and movement. The work explores the tension between various forces and spatial perception in sound and moving image: energy is being fed into a system, resulting in movement and centrifugal forces. During this build up of energy and speed the system becomes unstable and new accidental possibilities of sensory perception present themselves.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tLv1bT5WDqnwHUKPlOph9Efpkjd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entrop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2639243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zeno van den Broek","original_name":"Zeno van den Broek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebe3f71bc8abc0022c37e30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1725,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tLv1bT5WDqnwHUKPlOph9Efpkjd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1150}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"No Language\", \"english_name\"=>\"No Language\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"xx\", \"native_name\"=>\"No Language\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
