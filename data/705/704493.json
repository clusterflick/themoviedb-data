Equipped with a Super-8 camera by Helga Reidemeister, the family had already begun filming their everyday life independently in the fall of 1969. However, when, together with Reidemeister, they looked through the four-hour material at the editing table in the summer of 1974, they realized that it depicted the family's problems only superficially and left the social context out of the picture. Reidemeister, who had not yet intervened in the film shooting, then spent a lot of time with the family and documented everyday life together with them. The result was a multi-layered mixture of family self-testimony and reflection on social relationships.","popularity":0.061,"poster_path":"/mStAbw0WMLyid2baxw8CcpsgRTA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bought Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1427088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helga Reidemeister","original_name":"Helga Reidemeister","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":"/spIIFKIykAnBErE2opGC6mm8odT.jpg","credit_id":"5ebe824b3d3557001ee0341b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduard Gernart","original_name":"Eduard Gernart","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebe82616d675a00217bf729","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1427088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helga Reidemeister","original_name":"Helga Reidemeister","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":"/spIIFKIykAnBErE2opGC6mm8odT.jpg","credit_id":"5ebe82909979d200212a554d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduard Gernart","original_name":"Eduard Gernart","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebe82a08e2e00001f128bf5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0162343","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/weDW57fDISfp3oTMFE9FDHDMMZr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":765,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/579cvBzlY7zVOZ5ieYoKs2oMrxl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":510},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/mStAbw0WMLyid2baxw8CcpsgRTA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"German\", \"english_name\"=>\"German\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"de\", \"native_name\"=>\"German\"}","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
