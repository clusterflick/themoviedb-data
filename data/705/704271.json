Scenes of birthday parties, picnics in the park, kids playing with sparklers and more intimate interactions such as a pair kissing and a parent and child gazing through a telescope — taken from actual TV and online commercials — become visible as they push through the surface of the grid/screen. New narratives are formed through layering, nesting, and repetition in a semi-automatic process that gives a sense that the characters have been set free from their prescribed actions and generating additional possibilities beyond our view.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/k8Po6kF5T9Xf5ocJ3S7yscojz4T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"telescope eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zach Nader","original_name":"Zach Nader","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebd98541283e9001eccb430","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k8Po6kF5T9Xf5ocJ3S7yscojz4T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
