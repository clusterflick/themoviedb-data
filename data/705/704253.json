Until recently, these stories were thought to be legends or tall tales. But scientists now know that single waves over 100 feet tall, known as \"rogue waves\", can arise without warning. These waves are more common than previously thought and pose a grave danger to ships and offshore platforms in their path. This program examines both the science behind rogue waves and current attempts to track them in real time. Also, changes in ship design may give vessels a better chance to survive them.","popularity":0.1942,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rogue Waves: The Sinking of Poseidon","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"MonstervÃ¥gor","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David O'Brien","original_name":"David O'Brien","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self (voice)","credit_id":"5ebd93423d3557001cdd5abe","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638713,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cynthia Harrison","original_name":"Cynthia Harrison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebd938f15a4a1001d9c7f21","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638715,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Norman Drake","original_name":"Norman Drake","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebd93a9076ce800217755e7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134089,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bill Froehlich","original_name":"Bill Froehlich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebd937cbc8abc0023c21312","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1232939,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bill Froehlich","original_name":"Bill Froehlich","popularity":0.1429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebd9372c50ad2002585f7ed","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261699,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joey Barasch","original_name":"Joey Barasch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebd93b7bc8abc0021c21da2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1714539,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Susan Michaels","original_name":"Susan Michaels","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebd939c8586780021e55127","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1232939,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bill Froehlich","original_name":"Bill Froehlich","popularity":0.1429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebd93693d3557001ddc80c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0884742","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
