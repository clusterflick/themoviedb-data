When he called her that evening to see how she was doing, she immediately turned the question on him. “Holding a lot back,” he said “I’m doing okay. It’s just been a hard day,” to which his grandmother replied “A hard day because of school or a hard day because Bob died?” The film explores the loss of love and its impact on how descendants of that first couple experience it.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/88EkAVBEAQ7SVbDNNvAH4qRmtha.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"First Holiday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Myles Murdock","original_name":"Myles Murdock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebf1a6b4083b3001e844a83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":773,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/88EkAVBEAQ7SVbDNNvAH4qRmtha.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
