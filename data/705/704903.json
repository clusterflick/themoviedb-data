Itâ€™s 1954, the height of the Cold War. As the arms race builds to a fevered pace, spymasters in Britain and America know they have to find a way of infiltrating the Soviet machine. They must find out what Russian intentions are. This is the gripping true story of Operation Gold: the mission to build a 450-metre spy tunnel under Berlin, one of the most heavily guarded cities in history.","popularity":0.23,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":133971,"logo_path":null,"name":"ORTV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spies Beneath Berlin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Berlins Underjordiska Spioner","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Hacker","original_name":"Jonathan Hacker","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"self (voice)","credit_id":"5ebfbf3e3d3557001dde47c9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Benstead","original_name":"Sam Benstead","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfbea26d675a00217e4700","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607188,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gregers Sall","original_name":"Gregers Sall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfbf179979d200212c92b9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Hacker","original_name":"Jonathan Hacker","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfbed579b3d4001c9229b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Benstead","original_name":"Sam Benstead","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfbeac79b3d4001b929905","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Benstead","original_name":"Sam Benstead","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfbeb879b3d4001b929923","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Hacker","original_name":"Jonathan Hacker","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfbec46d675a001f7c2632","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1799545,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gary Clarke","original_name":"Gary Clarke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfbeed79b3d4001b929965","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2171099,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Swindell","original_name":"Tom Swindell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfbf0479b3d4001d931ef9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2041475","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
