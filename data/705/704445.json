A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it  cannot. Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a  result or reading from a slower data store; thus, the more requests that can be served from the cache,  the faster the system performs.\" (Wikipedia)","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9midbBwQG7J5lXPhSb0UOASeduW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MUCUS (uncacheable)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2639241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonin De Bemels","original_name":"Antonin De Bemels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Themself","credit_id":"5ebe3e1215a4a1001e9d027b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2639241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonin De Bemels","original_name":"Antonin De Bemels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebe3e08bc8abc0023c296e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9midbBwQG7J5lXPhSb0UOASeduW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"No Language\", \"english_name\"=>\"No Language\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"xx\", \"native_name\"=>\"No Language\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
