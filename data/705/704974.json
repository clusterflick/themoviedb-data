But what exactly happened during the last day of his life? Relive April 14, 1865, as we track the hours of the day that shocked the world, following both assassin and victim on separate paths that would ultimately converge at the Presidential Box at Ford's Theatre. We'll also look at the objects, like Lincoln's hat and John Wilkes Booth's gun, that witnessed the crime that changed the course of American history forever.","popularity":0.1587,"poster_path":"/pmpwNUXP8V6vgrc7qceCxtV8ndK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18894,"logo_path":"/rFr30k0B8DgdZtPHjzAtQIJ3XDH.png","name":"Smithsonian
