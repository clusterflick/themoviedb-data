An early entry in the Metâ€™s series of PBS telecasts, this 1978 performance captures a young James Morris in a smooth portrayal of the title role, with the legendary Joan Sutherland showing off her unsurpassed technique as Donna Anna and Gabriel Bacquier as a masterful Leporello.","popularity":0.3424,"poster_path":"/7twdwE5BURwZVdRHcKk4mUALMUA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":182,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
