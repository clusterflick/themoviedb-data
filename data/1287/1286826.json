Located in a conservative northern Canadian city often hostile to queer people, Flashback became a sensation on the international club circuit despite police raids, threats of violence and the scourge of AIDS. Flashback is a ghost. But it comes alive again in the memories of the people who were there and the legends they left behind.","popularity":0.0782,"poster_path":"/sLgI09eYpssUPe3zUzgmGjq0H46.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A legendary 80's nightclub in an unlikely location","title":"Flashback","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4700324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Hays","original_name":"Peter Hays","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663aaa7c3fbfecd5d70527ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4700324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Hays","original_name":"Peter Hays","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6665ef42081ce24260e9cb93","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4765455,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthew Hays","original_name":"Matthew Hays","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6665ef4f86b7b8d3c11593f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33341149","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/22svqpdtKZvOvXEGrMRiQLr3bJt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sLgI09eYpssUPe3zUzgmGjq0H46.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tSSt5Yw1k7nM3bYIT33sVGfaqH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
