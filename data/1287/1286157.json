While digitizing, the film was physically bent, twisted, rotated and treated to a number of hands-on manipulations. The images then underwent further visual transformation in digital post production.The music was largely an intuitive process. the basic sound sources including thumb piano, pygmy pipe and gamelan metallophone tones, were digitally transformed and then contrapuntally layered, inter-cut, diced and threaded into a pulsating «spider web» design suggested by a visual imagery.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":"/kfCjvRD7eXxHG4JPftTV2SRDJAY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terra Incognita","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Maxwell","original_name":"Stephanie Maxwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663940ea813cb6012189b464","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2991476","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kfCjvRD7eXxHG4JPftTV2SRDJAY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
