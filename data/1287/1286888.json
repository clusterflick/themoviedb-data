Now 4 years and 10 programs later we return to the 767 so we can cover this airplane in Hi-Definition on Blu-ray along with cover our 1st ever cockpit flight to Hawaii! In addition we've included a flight to one of the world's favorite destinations : St Maarten! Both Captains, which includes Air Canada's 767 Fleet Manager, along with their copilots will give you the most fantastic presentations from the moment they arrive in the office to prepare their flights to the moment their aircraft reaches the gate at the other end. Everything is explained to you in details so you can have a perfect idea of what it takes to fly a widebody over the Atlantic and the Pacific! You will enjoy approaches into several destinations filmed from fantastic angles showing both the pilots at work and the amazing scenery.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pzxJs4Ruvv4A6kwWXCf0KhyEw54.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Just Planes Video Inc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":275,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Air Canada 767-300","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pzxJs4Ruvv4A6kwWXCf0KhyEw54.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
