Because he’s land-rich but cash-poor, he grudgingly accepts an offer from a production company to use his land as a film location. Though it’s good money, the tough rancher doesn’t trust that the Hollywood film crew will treat his land with the respect it deserves. Alexander holds onto a deeply traditional vision of his world just as the film’s director, a creative urbanite named Fabian, maintains his own vision for his film. Both men are hoping for the best: Alexander wants to save his ranch, and Fabian wants to be catapulted to the next 'it' filmmaker.","popularity":1.4834,"poster_path":"/9jEucfo5VRbHagnZk6PvNkqDXTX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nova Vento Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":47444,"logo_path":null,"name":"Second Wind Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Somewhere in Montana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham McTavish","original_name":"Graham McTavish","popularity":0.7942,"profile_path":"/9IjPwv7Vb4QygA1cPSX179oqjsT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Alexander","credit_id":"6639fe8e66565a01231713f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323247,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matt Drago","original_name":"Matt Drago","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Fabian Verdugo","credit_id":"6639febbe323f30128daa75e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":91461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Hurd","original_name":"Michelle Hurd","popularity":1.236,"profile_path":"/cdFf791CMSWvCNH1wksf32oPT2e.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kat","credit_id":"6639fecd3a48c501314fd318","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1751311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Stoddard","original_name":"Jonathan Stoddard","popularity":0.4858,"profile_path":"/ct64PRjZpTFphgdlezQ7c2lMIrC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Spencer Chase","credit_id":"6639fee35a469001253f3760","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Orsini","original_name":"Kate Orsini","popularity":0.7787,"profile_path":"/uRGuIwOB1aGQoMpJ4oCgok9Wb09.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dhalia","credit_id":"6639fef2e92d830124d4901e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Monks","original_name":"Michael Monks","popularity":0.3886,"profile_path":"/jlSNQND26pDrxFih2ImhgqGOirn.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Frank","credit_id":"6639feff9590e30126bdf6f9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2504614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Szal","original_name":"Mick Szal","popularity":0.1537,"profile_path":"/s3A3adaBlROorijl667bYm8FPN7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Shelby","credit_id":"6639ff11470ead012a13fbcb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaleigh Macchio","original_name":"Kaleigh Macchio","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Laney Alexander","credit_id":"6639ff2354508d0122d3c17b","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brandon Smith","original_name":"Brandon Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6639fe5cd6dbba012360e77a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brandon Smith","original_name":"Brandon Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6639fe679590e30126bdf6a2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1714482,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"AJ Young","original_name":"AJ Young","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":"/y6FUJEb96VZROGbZ8SmDuFCntRW.jpg","credit_id":"67a5a0088dbb4c099066f0c1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11898070","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9jEucfo5VRbHagnZk6PvNkqDXTX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":680,"name":"montana"},{"id":281237,"name":"independent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Somewhere in Montana Teaser Trailer","key":"bd4EdNwqk-8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2023-06-15T03:02:17.000Z","id":"663a0abae323f30125daadcb"}]}}}
