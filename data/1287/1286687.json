I use a wood carving knife to scratch off the photographic emulsion of the looped film as a live performance. Scratched patterns, which would be mostly horizontal lines, will appear as an abstract animation on the screen and produce noises, as the area of the filmstrip reserved for the optical soundtrack will be also scratched. Due to the distance between the gate of the projector and the position of the photocell to read the visual information for sound, the noise from a scratched pattern will be produced about a second later after it appears on the screen.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/iGp5RyzPlc5foVDV4a4bNZs4t71.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Six Seventy-Two Variations, Variation 3 (For Charles)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350156,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomonari Nishikawa","original_name":"Tomonari Nishikawa","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":"/mT80BkuO49rYX4ED7B6L2k5d6uj.jpg","credit_id":"663a7624889b824c3b1c6152","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iGp5RyzPlc5foVDV4a4bNZs4t71.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
