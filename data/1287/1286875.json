We were not only lucky enough to be able to present this operation to you but we actually cover a check ride in which a Captain gets his ETOPS qualification so you can discover everything about ETOPS in details with 2 pilots eager to present every aspect of this sort of operation to you. Bonus is a flight in and out of Heathrow captured both in the cockpit and from the cabin with a great wing view. Many other features make this yet another fantastic Air Canada program!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/isNZYf2Ug6ZBZwKyLXNfb0MgZ6Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Just Planes Video Inc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":269,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Air Canada A319 ETOPS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/isNZYf2Ug6ZBZwKyLXNfb0MgZ6Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
