The images were created by hand-painting directly on 35mm film, then digitizing these images to apply visual effects. Many of the musical sounds were created by computer accoustical analysis and, during resynthesis, transformation of instrumental, vocal and environmental sounds. Algorithmic programs written by the composer generated many of the rythmic, melodic and textural ideas, but others were created the «old fashioned» way, at the composer's piano.","popularity":0.0452,"poster_path":"/czXrShLCq1c0hInOo2Ty2nn2veZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Somewhere","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Maxwell","original_name":"Stephanie Maxwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66392d6c8de0ae012cf73cea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2991408","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1496,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/czXrShLCq1c0hInOo2Ty2nn2veZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1003}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
