The concept is not simply the familiar (although perhaps illusory) forward, linear 'march' of clock time, but rather a nexus in which backwards time (e.g. , dreams, recollections together of segments of time are equally prominent. The visuals are animations and manipulations of hand-painted 35mm motion picture film, small objects, copier art, and liquid mixtures that are extensively interwoven and layered in digital post production. The principal sound sources of the music are generic samples (digitized recordings of instrumental and vocal tones and of environmental sounds such as ice cubes and ping pong balls). However, in re-synthesis the spectral structures (tones colors) of these sounds often have benne retooled and their attack and decay articulations have been altered.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2kdjpaENwk0YYCrcWysO6oASAdx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Streams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Maxwell","original_name":"Stephanie Maxwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663953256611b40124695954","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2991488","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2kdjpaENwk0YYCrcWysO6oASAdx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
