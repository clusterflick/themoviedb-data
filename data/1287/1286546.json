The film begins on an operating table in Germany and then follows its author on a personal journey through the Venetian canals, Broadway and Sunset Boulevard, coming full circle in his native Romania. The director thus initiates a deep research of the real, through which he can reach, from the knowledge and understanding of others, to self-knowledge and self-understanding. He records not his own sensations, but the testimonies of other people who have gone through similar experiences (composers, painters, sculptors or writers). Captivating, disturbing and surprisingly humorous, the documentary is an extreme emotional ride through a series of revelatory encounters with artists hoping to stand the test of time.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Testimonial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1929956,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Razvan Georgescu","original_name":"Razvan Georgescu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663a447e8de0ae012cf7af97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
