Here Williams chronicles an east meets west festival held in the Iranian city of Shiraz. Williamsâ€™ love affair with music and montage helps lend pace and life to a film whose sonic interests range from Iranian lutes and Indian oboes to American Cathy Berberian, who is busy turning comic strips into song. A glimpse of cosmopolitan Iran prior to the Iranian Revolution, it includes a rare interview with New Yorker classical music critic Andrew Porter.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sound the Trumpets Beat the Drums","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1510550,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tony Hide","original_name":"Tony Hide","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663a795fe29f30ee388aa485","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4699788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mahmoud Khosrowshahi Mahmoud Khosrowshahi","original_name":"Mahmoud Khosrowshahi Mahmoud Khosrowshahi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663a797c438b7831d4a9fb29","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4699784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Williams","original_name":"Tony Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663a793d071e715b207d9713","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4699785,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Peter Heyworth","original_name":"Peter Heyworth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663a79504a784db485e66dbf","department":"Crew","job":"Presenter"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
