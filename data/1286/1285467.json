This pin screen was left behind for his daughter Svetlana when he returned to Paris after the war. Svetlana let me experiment with it in 1983-84 at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard University where I was teaching at the time. This is presented to honor the legacy of Jules Engel, the first animation program head at Cal Arts.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alexeieff Pin Screen Animation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991272,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Sky-David","original_name":"Sky-David","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6637cc8b07faa20123231cfa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
