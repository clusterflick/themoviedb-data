Under the Vichy regime, the camps were used to intern other criminalized population groups and French Jews, who were also deported from there to extermination camps. In a mosaic of artificially framed shots, formerly interned contemporary witnesses describe their own life stories. Director Mangiante not only sheds light on the history of the camps, but also the mechanisms of personal memory.","popularity":0.0448,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'Ici","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les camps du silence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Mangiante","original_name":"Bernard Mangiante","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66389c522a09bc012c5a8920","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denis Gheerbrant","original_name":"Denis Gheerbrant","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66389c6a8de0ae0129f71127","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4696820,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Philippe Renaut","original_name":"Philippe Renaut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66389c829590e30123bd6bb9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2983077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mona Fillières","original_name":"Mona Fillières","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66389cc666565a0128167b7c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477159,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Catherine K.
