The imagery was created by hand painting on 35 mm clear and black film emulsion film stocks using paints, markers, air brushing, and nitric acid. Other techniques include stenciling, etching, and collage of live action film 'cut outs' and hand-painted film fragments directly into lengths of 35mm film. The music is an original electronic sound score.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8h6WNO46W8npnpJOaGDH82kaxgU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Please Don't Stop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Maxwell","original_name":"Stephanie Maxwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663817578de0ae012cf6a150","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2991370","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8h6WNO46W8npnpJOaGDH82kaxgU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
