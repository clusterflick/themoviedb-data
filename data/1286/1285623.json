The floating pendants of the mobile each reveal a mysterious world filled with unique visual and aural forms, movements and gestures. The visuals have been created using hand-cut animated mattes in combination with hand-painted and etched clear and black 35 mm motion picture film. These images were then digitalized, visually transformed and manipulated, composited and post produced. The computer-generated music consists of continuous variations and transformations of a seemingly simple but open-ended harmonic theme that caroms through many key centers. However, this theme takes shape gradually, and is heard most clearly in a choral setting only after all five «protagonists» of the work have been introduced.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/i0TRYwcONLmdmHEnrMztiOePQGH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passe-partout","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Maxwell","original_name":"Stephanie Maxwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66381636c616ac01251b3022","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i0TRYwcONLmdmHEnrMztiOePQGH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
