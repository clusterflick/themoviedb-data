Through a series of absurd (and sometimes musical) flashbacks, the night unravels as each attempts to convince Sid that only by sharing her struggles will she finally be free of them. A queer comedic romp into the nightmarish challenges of finding the \"right\" therapist, THERAPY WON'T KILL YOU is a trippy and whimsical whirlwind, bending genre at every turn.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/2Xl7bWzjOLVy4DoRy435sp1YpEe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Therapy
