The majority of these victims came from Japan and South Korea but it’s believed that nationals from at least 11 other countries, including Thailand, Romania, Holland and France were also taken.  Some were abducted to teach North Korean spies their language and culture so that their spies could integrate more easily in foreign countries. Others were taken to provide wives for American deserters or North Korean army officers.  The fate of most of these hostages is still unknown. Some were held hostage in the totalitarian dictatorship for 40 years before finally being released. Others died or were killed in captivity. However some may still be alive and being held against their will. We investigate the phenomenon of the North Korean abductees.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/atP7XGK70hrLMi6Qu3GOZwRGJar.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kidnapped by North Korea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/atP7XGK70hrLMi6Qu3GOZwRGJar.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
