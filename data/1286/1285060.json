She is not the kind of person to stand with a big poster at a Friday For Future demonstration. Instead she saves the planet in a quiet way, living off-grid with her one-year old child in Southern Estonia in a self-built tiny house with no water or electricity. Although it seems extreme, for her it’s the most natural way to live.","popularity":0.179,"poster_path":"/sP6YdIW4tYQr7GUdKlsCUDx2Xlp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228083,"logo_path":null,"name":"McQueen OÜ","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2024-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hilda Ha.
