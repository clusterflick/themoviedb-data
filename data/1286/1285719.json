The first part is a man's monologue about a grueling LSD adventure (even the image is a washout), and the second is the portrait of a woman, gleefully milking cacophony from a tape recorder by rapidly playing with the buttons. It is an essay in the filmmaker's twofold aesthetic: the roughness and punch of experience remains without cosmetics, unsentimentalized, uninterpreted; instead, the material of its transmission, image, and sound, becomes the field of cathartic, nervous play, a wild Hasidic dance.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/8bWN2XRwHNzp9E5K4w5QTfidXz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raps and Chants, Part II","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saul Levine","original_name":"Saul Levine","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/lfLF8BWO3fkpx2P0971gGT156x2.jpg","credit_id":"6638579e8de0ae012cf6ea08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5988348","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8bWN2XRwHNzp9E5K4w5QTfidXz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
