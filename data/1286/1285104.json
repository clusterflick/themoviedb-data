In these stories, we meet peculiar vehicles known as “karakat” from Peipsi, charming non-places of Tartu, the wild German woman living an off-grid life without water and electricity, mischievous goats and crazy village parties, the diverse Annelinn residents and nostalgic Petseri, slime mould and space exploration, and of course, the artists of survival from today and past.","popularity":0.4079,"poster_path":"/a6zMxD0q4JS3XPMe50IJ6HzocUf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2024-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Eight films about Southern Estonia","title":"Wild South","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Wild South – short films about Southern Estonia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrey Paounov","original_name":"Andrey Paounov","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/cevIhATTmZCMjViUSoD5NaLs0P6.jpg","credit_id":"6636abdb0328b9012ddbe8ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ülo Pikkov","original_name":"Ülo Pikkov","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/4dQeOtl2KxAS0o0QJb1kIXny7OH.jpg","credit_id":"6636ac1783ee67012a4180e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viesturs Kairišs","original_name":"Viesturs Kairišs","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":"/eN7MeihOABSaOw4UuL0OPwvnjOW.jpg","credit_id":"6636ac0f2a09bc012659c30d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2279720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Olsson","original_name":"Carl Olsson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/hNHAAOXIy1803gi6fyTJLAmnXEO.jpg","credit_id":"6636ac229590e30123bc4a7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137677,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaan Tootsen","original_name":"Jaan Tootsen","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/tlsGRJIe9mVylqRYLa7tZaAGwhW.jpg","credit_id":"6636abfa6611b4012467f6a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Kübar","original_name":"Eva Kübar","popularity":0.1068,"profile_path":"/toKdCPuu1ZHlQRjQXhCv2JnadCZ.jpg","credit_id":"6636abcb0c1255012c7d0738","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2957743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Aua","original_name":"Maria Aua","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jpdCsQ15aQ8n3FEd2mEBcEaUZKz.jpg","credit_id":"6636abea356a710129179c62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andris Gauja","original_name":"Andris Gauja","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":"/5O4NFzLE4GgzCJK9OhLjwwMi07Q.jpg","credit_id":"6636abad358da7012a560424","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/a6zMxD0q4JS3XPMe50IJ6HzocUf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1350},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1422,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/sADf04pBAm4bO3tXhAWS3E4x2ig.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9706,"name":"anthology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
