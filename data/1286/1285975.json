Taking inspiration from the life of Joan Jett, and the incredible story structure of Netflix’s 2019 hit series Russian Doll, Ripe is an exploration of existential dread through resistance and age. The film’s protagonist, Frannie Washington (Lisa Sponaugle) takes center stage, with her struggles epitomizing rebellion - a rebellion against age, a rebellion against the status quo, and to some extent a rebellion against herself.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Old ain't dead.","title":"Ripe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4697460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Sponaugle","original_name":"Lisa Sponaugle","popularity":0.0632,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Frannie Washington","credit_id":"6638f75bae3843012bca0ffc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3699162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Nicole Brown","original_name":"Gina Nicole Brown","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/fyMYqUnkICaHALCkTXHT9L52fBG.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pat Void","credit_id":"6638f777c616ac01251bc815","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4697464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ege Yalcinbas","original_name":"Ege Yalcinbas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Marie Washington","credit_id":"6638f7d2c9054f012a91648c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4697467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariel Casey","original_name":"Ariel Casey","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Maverick","credit_id":"6638f7e86611b4012d6928a2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3568406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tristan Au","original_name":"Tristan Au","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hkTy1iJaAgFHA00nGAg1jI4BRH6.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Michael Lee","credit_id":"6638f7f75a469001223eb570","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4231476,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fernando Rocha","original_name":"Fernando Rocha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6638f6ee2a09bc01235a9842","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4430701,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gaby Sosa","original_name":"Gaby Sosa","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6638f6da2faf4d0127c67ec6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4697458,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Will Rothermel","original_name":"Will Rothermel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6638f72566565a01261691a3","department":"Sound","job":"Supervising Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4430701,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gaby Sosa","original_name":"Gaby Sosa","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6638f6cf6611b4012469461e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4430701,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gaby Sosa","original_name":"Gaby Sosa","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6638f6c46611b40124694617","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
