The selected images are printed on Lucent fabrics and behind those the artist coquets with masculine and feminine poses: smoking, applying makeup, knotting a tie etc. The reference to the painting “Pygmalion and Galathea” by Jean-Léon Gérôme can be regarded as the ironic highpoint concerning the gender debate: The ancient legend of the gifted sculptor Pygmalion, who, in the spirit of the Male Gaze, carves his perfect woman out of stone, is a perfect metaphor for the creation of a completely artificial femininity, as it is alsoembodied by transvestites. The prefix trans- is thereby symptomatic for the whole staging of the film: the projections and the artist seem to permeate and superimpose each other constantly.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/n8SeVYMC5nxTmn3VSnj1XylhqQl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eingebildete Männlichkeit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4695564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Girl","original_name":"Jerry Girl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6637a98b813cb601278904b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philipp Gufler","original_name":"Philipp Gufler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7TAn6HVX1UJJ3hQMncDEJjtwUcE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6637a99394d8a8012b3323b1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philipp Gufler","original_name":"Philipp Gufler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7TAn6HVX1UJJ3hQMncDEJjtwUcE.jpg","credit_id":"6637a9a0813cb601278904bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philipp Gufler","original_name":"Philipp Gufler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7TAn6HVX1UJJ3hQMncDEJjtwUcE.jpg","credit_id":"6637a9aa8de0ae0129f68f9e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4684394,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Door","original_name":"Daniel Door","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6637a9fa470ead012812fcbc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i4DtrenGhgNnLrRNRyFaDiLXnq5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n8SeVYMC5nxTmn3VSnj1XylhqQl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1132}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Eingebildete Maennlichkeit (excerpt) by Philipp Gufler, 2012/2013","key":"365506859","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-10T12:03:40.000Z","id":"6637a9dd2faf4d0127c5ac9f"}]}}}
