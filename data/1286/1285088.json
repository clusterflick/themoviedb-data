The Russian Old Believers who inhabited the island appeared here 300 years ago, during the Great Northern War, fleeing from the religious reforms in the Orthodox Church and to avoid being mobilized in the Russian army. As the waves have washed the island smaller and smaller, the community here has also fused over time, inevitably reaching the brink of extinction. However, the local culture and sense of life that developed in isolation from the rest of the “Russian world” has not yet completely disappeared from Piiriissaar.","popularity":0.1133,"poster_path":"/sVl22R3t59s4eZs2hgABnmdABys.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17692,"logo_path":"/vdMBCn1foLJArmSaY094AQVrMyv.png","name":"Nafta","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":85171,"logo_path":"/1O7e8sk2hazDqDdK59ZehQHQQ7g.png","name":"Ego Media","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2024-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cohabitants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","title":"Metsik lõuna: Eluteelised","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4694456,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tomek Pawlik","original_name":"Tomek Pawlik","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6636a23c0f5265012bbb7d9e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413695,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Esko Rips","original_name":"Esko Rips","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/i0SqMKbG82xPkXQETOwYoTA4NWn.jpg","credit_id":"6636a26ffe6c18012330741d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076349,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wojciech Staroń","original_name":"Wojciech Staroń","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/rLKVwhP8S33InEyw0ot4JqBqZI6.jpg","credit_id":"6636a22d99d5c301295854f2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152385,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mart Kessel-Otsa","original_name":"Mart Kessel-Otsa","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/c6MTdLFTfp8KEQrlipVVNIIqVrF.jpg","credit_id":"6636a257813cb6012988802f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viesturs Kairišs","original_name":"Viesturs Kairišs","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":"/eN7MeihOABSaOw4UuL0OPwvnjOW.jpg","credit_id":"6636a248e92d830121d34bf8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725720,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gert Mäll","original_name":"Gert Mäll","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6636a2626611b4012a67f6da","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1733549,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guntis Trekteris","original_name":"Guntis Trekteris","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6636a28c9590e30126bc4217","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3902501,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olga Hartšuk","original_name":"Olga Hartšuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6636a27d99d5c3012c5853bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viesturs Kairišs","original_name":"Viesturs Kairišs","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":"/eN7MeihOABSaOw4UuL0OPwvnjOW.jpg","credit_id":"6636a2172a09bc012959bc01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viesturs Kairišs","original_name":"Viesturs Kairišs","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":"/eN7MeihOABSaOw4UuL0OPwvnjOW.jpg","credit_id":"678a410b55e49bed5e97b5b2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2906982,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juris Vaivods","original_name":"Juris Vaivods","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b683a264def0053f147b04","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30987451","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/sVl22R3t59s4eZs2hgABnmdABys.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":565},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1223,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eCc2Hmpr4HYNKXeupIh9jm7K9dw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":815}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest Riga","release_date":"2025-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IDFA","release_date":"2024-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
