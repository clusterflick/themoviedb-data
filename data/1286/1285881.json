From the break of dawn and the echo of morning  prayer, the director, Abderrahmane Sissako travels with  his audience through the alleys of the old city, into  mosques, courtyards and markets, mapping the  traditions and daily lives of one nation in a changing  world. Goods are seen arriving on dhows from the sea  and on camel caravans from the desert – through  capturing a day in the life of the city the film articulates  how a country became a global port with international  visitors. The crisp clear pictures brushed with a special  painting-effect across the film makes it feel timeless and  eternal.","popularity":0.053,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8152,"logo_path":"/shnLD1Pj9d1vB2TH93QHSNT5gzW.png","name":"DFI","origin_country":"QA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2019-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Al Zubarah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2430801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Castella","original_name":"Charles Castella","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6638ccb91b729401273792fd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4509128,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Naoufel Ben Youssef","original_name":"Naoufel Ben Youssef","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6638ccfac616ac01281bba5f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2779763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Ceballos","original_name":"Ricardo Ceballos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6638ccd3c9054f012d915754","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abderrahmane Sissako","original_name":"Abderrahmane Sissako","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/lQew5sGuT5Tni75EuFBnG3FjZ6n.jpg","credit_id":"6638cca766565a01281691b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4697090,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fatma Hassan Al Remaihi","original_name":"Fatma Hassan Al Remaihi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6638ccea470ead0128138f79","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abderrahmane Sissako","original_name":"Abderrahmane Sissako","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/lQew5sGuT5Tni75EuFBnG3FjZ6n.jpg","credit_id":"6638ccb0cc277c0126242218","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10507486","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
