These «direct animation» images subsequently were transformed by video and digital processing, and creatively edited to «activate» and intensify the original animation of colorful, abstract moving forms.\r Many of the sound sources were derived from computer analysis, resynthesis and transformations of Western, African and Asian acoustic sounds. Principal software, employed on SGI computers at the Eastman Computer Music Computer, included Csound (Vercoe) and score 11 (Brinkman), rt (Lansky), SMS (Serra), various linear prediction programs and utilities, and algorithmic compositional software written by the composer that generate note or event streams based and permutations.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/y1xJ8jQ6sCjqOo3i58dTtqduESz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outermost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Maxwell","original_name":"Stephanie Maxwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66381426470ead012a12f757","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y1xJ8jQ6sCjqOo3i58dTtqduESz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
