It premiered on the episode broadcast on January 14th 1991, alongside behind the scenes footage of Villeneuve translating his words into English, and the producers in Canada.  The short appears to have been filmed in Tokyo, and features some of Vangelis' score for Blade Runner (1982). Villeneuve would go on to direct the film's sequel, Blade Runner 2049.  Publically, all that remains of this short is the behind the scenes footage released from Radio-Canada's archive.","popularity":0.461,"poster_path":"/9uTFFy6rvKW16bkWE6Bkl9vIQM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radio Canada","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1991-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Ink","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denis Villeneuve","original_name":"Denis Villeneuve","popularity":3.057,"profile_path":"/zdDx9Xs93UIrJFWYApYR28J8M6b.jpg","credit_id":"6637d03d35d1bc012c0ac12a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denis Villeneuve","original_name":"Denis Villeneuve","popularity":3.057,"profile_path":"/zdDx9Xs93UIrJFWYApYR28J8M6b.jpg","credit_id":"6637d0442a09bc01265a28e4","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":595,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vangelis","original_name":"Vangelis","popularity":0.3954,"profile_path":"/7qSj7Dk0mMytSxSHTsSIi4tmgnu.jpg","credit_id":"6637d04dcaa5080126f52146","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m2AjwjU6nfD7eKXVbdwG8Z2rct5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dIoNsWjrU0PXGDn5k2csV5wXwLp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9uTFFy6rvKW16bkWE6Bkl9vIQM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
