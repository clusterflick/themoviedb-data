As a child, Karishma faced harassment for wearing soccer attire, and as a woman, she battles online bullying from aggressive crowds challenging the rights of girls in the mountains. She has numerous opponents, but she also has the unconditional support of her grandmother, a wise Wakhi woman who lives in a hut in an isolated village. Girls Move Mountains explores the enduring struggle for women's rights in the pursuit of a fairer world, while it shows how older generations plant seeds for the ones to come.","popularity":0.0511,"poster_path":"/dJKjxd1VFBurSbhw1LaTblSLeVt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girls Move Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4696725,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carlos Prieto","original_name":"Carlos Prieto","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663885c8358da7012756c8e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4696723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Huix","original_name":"Anna Huix","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663885d60d2944012a6e0446","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118955,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tono Folguera","original_name":"Tono Folguera","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/8DrMkNxWF7QuzlYZaXDSqfbYQdE.jpg","credit_id":"66388607e92d830124d40816","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882738,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guille Cascante","original_name":"Guille Cascante","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663885ef813cb601298988fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4696723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Huix","original_name":"Anna Huix","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6638859fb76cbb01296271c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1xQz80wuNhxzJtl2prVwkPOjCII.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1499,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dJKjxd1VFBurSbhw1LaTblSLeVt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1124}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
