While there were still living approximately 50,000 Sorbs in the 1990s, today there are only 5,000 left who can speak the language.  The core settlement area was destroyed by coal mining and the language is now threatened with extinction. But the community of Crostwitz sticks together, traditions are cherished and community is lived.  Despite limited resources, the football club, which forms the centre of one Sorbian village, has bravely held its own in the regional league, Saxony's second-highest division, for years.  Footballer Franc (15) takes us into his world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fScTWeIRo5CJATzNry9Se3H0wBg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Would Be a Different Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3768199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justina Jürgensen","original_name":"Justina Jürgensen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66381825b76cbb01236210c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fScTWeIRo5CJATzNry9Se3H0wBg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
