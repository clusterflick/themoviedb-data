The image and music interact in a dramatic way to deepen and enhance the perception of an abstracted experience not far removed from its earthy provenance. The music attempts to create a spiritual sense of journey through the fractional evocation of ancient Egyptian folk song. The sonorous texture of trembling and contorted sound images illustrate the hesitation, solitude and endless dream-scape of the human mind.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wdVJDZX5bD7uKLEFW2mLLeRmiSz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Runa's Spell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Maxwell","original_name":"Stephanie Maxwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663880a4c9054f013091386b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2073069","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wdVJDZX5bD7uKLEFW2mLLeRmiSz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1005}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
