But her perception of herself is transformed when a girl in dance class comments on her hairy arms. After being compared to an ape, Lada begins to see herself as a monkey and goes about her days in a large, hairy body. With this newfound insecurity, Lada withdraws from activities she once loved and refuses to wear clothes that reveal her hairy body to others. Determined to fit in, Lada resolves to do something her mother would disapprove of: shave. When her older sister, Maria, catches Lada with a razor, she assumes the worst and intervenes. She reminds Lada that the most important thing in life is accepting yourself, and motivates Lada to keep dancing - hair and all.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hairy Beast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4696575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wai Sun Cheng","original_name":"Wai Sun Cheng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6638659d8de0ae0123f6eeb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
