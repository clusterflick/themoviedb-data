The film tells the imaginary story of the Bavarian Jammersee in fragments. The nuclear missile “Herrsching 2” - the Bavarians have finally provided for their own defense - is to be stored in a depot at the Jammersee. However, this comes into conflict with the other plan to fill the Jammersee with the ashes of the six million murdered Jews.","popularity":0.2825,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":31608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Herbert Achternbusch
