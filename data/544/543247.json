Settled in the prehistoric times by Polynesian sailors, who by simple means captured the enormous expanse of the Pacific. Home to the wave of waves, which has developed from a cultic action to a popular sport and has an enormous cultural significance to this day. This film shows the whole impressive beauty of this exotic world in breathtaking aerial photographs and detailed close-ups. The camera flies over glowing lava fields and through lush green 38 gorges.","popularity":0.0987,"poster_path":"/duRdbSxEJywORXn4ti8ULcy2u3w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A  Tropical Paradise","title":"Hawaii","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/35CTJHNByXRFE1UDUgUOHMmnkqF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":952,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nAOzJpIwL2RJqyb617JtQRBhwo6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/duRdbSxEJywORXn4ti8ULcy2u3w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
