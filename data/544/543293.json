Made over six years and shot on multiple camera formats, it captures candid moments in online chat rooms, in the home, in the wild, and in the streets, following the arc of a mother’s deterioration and death amidst shifting political and digital landscapes. From the birth of a child to the onset of dementia, from Tahrir Square to Standing Rock and Trump’s inauguration, Stand in the Stream is a pulsing and urgent contemporary ode and a call to action.","popularity":0.0507,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stand in the Stream","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1207496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanya Kahn","original_name":"Stanya Kahn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vjBcKTADdwQtjDWq38TRzaCJVb2.jpg","credit_id":"5b7989350e0a264728030012","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6896506","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
