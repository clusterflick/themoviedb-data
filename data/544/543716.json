In this Live in HD transmission of Die Walküre, the second and most popular installment in the composer’s sweeping tetralogy, Goerke is joined by bass-baritone Greer Grimsley as Brünnhilde godly father, Wotan, and mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton as his unbending wife, Fricka. As the incestuous lovers Siegmund and Sieglinde, soprano Eva-Maria Westbroek and tenor Stuart Skelton—alongside bass Günther Groissböck as Sieglinde’s bloodthirsty husband, Hunding—round out the principal cast. And on the podium, Maestro Philippe Jordan conducts Robert Lepage’s innovative staging, which uses state-of-the-art stage technology to tell Wagner’s mythic tale.","popularity":0.5929,"poster_path":"/1ehyAD3e9vIRSAMtmtQbnw5XIIm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":233,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Die Walküre","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Met Opera Live in HD- Die Walküre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2418303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Goerke","original_name":"Christine Goerke","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/96piv0okKIMiOtvuSuGxLbCkQ4b.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Brünnhilde","credit_id":"5d8b208e172d7f00174fb1ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva-Maria Westbroek","original_name":"Eva-Maria Westbroek","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":"/zZUpfmddyLN6sUSSDgeKeAgOX6Q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sieglinde","credit_id":"5d8b2096172d7f001f5020aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1897722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Barton","original_name":"Jamie Barton","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/j6SEqhSQY2aBLgF9k3sHCI4xsuC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Fricka","credit_id":"5d8b209f172d7f00174fb1cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Skelton","original_name":"Stuart Skelton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Siegmund","credit_id":"5d8b20a7abf8e2001977a506","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2418306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greer Grimsley","original_name":"Greer Grimsley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Wotan","credit_id":"5d8b20aed9f4a6000e51471d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günther Groissböck","original_name":"Günther Groissböck","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/dEynH6fOflbYc0wwO3cnZ8CtMZa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hunding","credit_id":"5d8b20b579b3d4000f86214a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":266422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Voigt","original_name":"Deborah Voigt","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":"/oofK3iDXS6FDclhHK8mDWwTWFC5.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Self -
