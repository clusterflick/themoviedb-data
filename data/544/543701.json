For the 2018 revival of Sonja Frisell’s monumental production of this grand masterpiece, the Met assembled a truly all-star cast. Soprano Anna Netrebko takes on the title role for the first time at the Met, and mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili plays her rival, the conniving princess Amneris. Tenor Aleksandrs Antonenko is Radamès, the warrior that both women love, and Quinn Kelsey lends his robust baritone to Aida’s father, the fallen king Amonasro. Maestro Nicola Luisotti is on the podium to conduct this epic performance, filmed as part of the Met’s series of Live in HD cinema transmissions.","popularity":0.3636,"poster_path":"/mnbYctURJ5UG0KUx7r0xQkwgh3g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":172,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Aida","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":459782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Netrebko","original_name":"Anna Netrebko","popularity":0.9234,"profile_path":"/2SdYMHksZoKwMDllc8C2rhLmXX6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Aida","credit_id":"5c495a5fc3a368478c8aa662","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Rachvelishvili","original_name":"Anita Rachvelishvili","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":"/cMi64qXbFqHwruuUuuoK6owBCFy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Amneris","credit_id":"5c495a6dc3a36847898a07c6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandrs Antonenko","original_name":"Aleksandrs Antonenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/en4KNbSDmU9Rhu7uey7GEOALOz0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Radamès","credit_id":"5c495a82c3a36847898a07e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1576826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitry Belosselskiy","original_name":"Dmitry Belosselskiy","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/st93OiQ35LKJ5mmhNhzDpiGEDAo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ramfis","credit_id":"5eace66e60c51d001e916d11","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Speedo Green","original_name":"Ryan Speedo Green","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The King","credit_id":"5eace67f60c51d0022916d7e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2621868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arseny Yakovlev","original_name":"Arseny Yakovlev","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"A Messenger","credit_id":"5eace68f0c3ec8001fcb09b2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1564360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Leonard","original_name":"Isabel Leonard","popularity":0.0243,"profile_path":"/xOqgibj4pXH0de6CNhKU44XciUs.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self -
