A cow crosses the road. The driver hits the breaks. Just in time. Or maybe too late. Nothing will be the same again. He tries to return to his old life, his home, his wife; but all that was hidden beneath the surface is now out in the open. Death is everywhere, in his chicken coop, in his marriage, inside of him. With three chickens on his shoulder and a forged Louis Vuitton suitcase he leaves for the outdoors, in order to find either his life or his death.","popularity":0.1234,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Awakening","title":"Hitorerut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilanit Ben-Yaakov","original_name":"Ilanit Ben-Yaakov","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64278e6d8a88b200b6b578c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2102354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moshe Folkenflick","original_name":"Moshe Folkenflick","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64278e789cc67b05796b1b1c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Qais Nashif","original_name":"Qais Nashif","popularity":0.2064,"profile_path":"/eah8iEuGFGU0k2Aj6HLYvjjnQ5y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64278ea7e2ff320111beeb4e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156703,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guy Meirson","original_name":"Guy Meirson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64278ed58a88b2007731778f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329211,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ziv Berkovich","original_name":"Ziv Berkovich","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6427ab5f9cc67b05bf6ed186","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156703,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guy Meirson","original_name":"Guy Meirson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64278edbc0442902130565e5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061910,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eitan Vardi","original_name":"Eitan Vardi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64278ef18a88b20097648aa8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5025870","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
