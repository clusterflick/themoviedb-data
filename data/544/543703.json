It’s fitting, then, that Samson et Dalila has been chosen to celebrate the opening of the Met’s season four times in the company’s history, including when Darko Tresnjak’s bold new production premiered on the first night of the 2018–19 season. A few weeks later, the opera was shown as part of the Met’s series of live cinema transmissions, featuring an exceptional cast. Tenor Roberto Alagna was the heroic Samson, who ultimately falls victim to the seductive power of Dalila—the captivating mezzo-soprano Elīna Garanča. Bass-baritone Laurent Naouri sang the sinister High Priest of Dagon, with conductor Sir Mark Elder on the podium.","popularity":0.6834,"poster_path":"/3aNCSBlItHOAVX0bi3zzMd1eWdW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Samson et Dalila","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":266306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Alagna","original_name":"Roberto Alagna","popularity":0.2857,"profile_path":"/1EuLaoZAfrDBK01CYJGdjQ34VzO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Samson","credit_id":"5cc000a60e0a265b0fed4ee3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":471356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elina Garanca","original_name":"Elina Garanca","popularity":0.2021,"profile_path":"/2xLi7RtxE1j2FQMuaXvVXkRjIr2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dalila","credit_id":"5cc0009f925141066efc4310","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurent Naouri","original_name":"Laurent Naouri","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/o2sx13HsVagwyF5fpkOYmrNBnDu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The High Priest of Dagon","credit_id":"5cc000ad0e0a266b96fc1352","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2235213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elchin Azizov","original_name":"Elchin Azizov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5Fv6n3prqowNzc4oI9vj8Vxn5nq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Abimélech","credit_id":"5ef15c0e2e2b2c0036733397","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1576826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitry Belosselskiy","original_name":"Dmitry Belosselskiy","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/st93OiQ35LKJ5mmhNhzDpiGEDAo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Old Hebrew","credit_id":"5ef15c249a8a8a0035b13879","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1304836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Stevenson","original_name":"Tony Stevenson","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"First Philistine","credit_id":"5ef15c382e2b2c00377128b3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradley Garvin","original_name":"Bradley Garvin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Second Philistine","credit_id":"5ef15c549a8a8a0034b07549","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Schowalter","original_name":"Mark Schowalter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"A Philistine Messenger","credit_id":"5ef15c666c84d60034ae69a1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1724539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Graham","original_name":"Susan Graham","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/zVIJJZFhPDkBz5K9ZGBkH6Lt0ti.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self -
