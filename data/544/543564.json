Merkel Must Go is not a film about PEGIDA, it asks for the personal reasons for this patriotic protest, a film about realistic and absurd fears of the present.","popularity":0.1533,"poster_path":"/iXfn1bWTlksEUgYGpmRIdUxK3qE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merkel Must Go","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2112057,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vinzent Kutsche","original_name":"Vinzent Kutsche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7bb3300e0a267c7f00a67e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1072823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabine Michel","original_name":"Sabine Michel","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/3nbilHbPvSH91GGsYj9aPpFn5Fv.jpg","credit_id":"5b7bb1da92514101eb00ae25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1072823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabine Michel","original_name":"Sabine Michel","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/3nbilHbPvSH91GGsYj9aPpFn5Fv.jpg","credit_id":"5b7bb2a092514101fb009c44","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2112056,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Martin Langner","original_name":"Martin Langner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7bb31892514101fb009cd3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2112059,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johannes Schneeweiß","original_name":"Johannes Schneeweiß","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7bb3840e0a267c710099bd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39902,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susann Schimk","original_name":"Susann Schimk","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/clWVEXvO4PbaKC93eOuDxTwxGzi.jpg","credit_id":"5b7bb2ed92514101e400a9e8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67733,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jörg Theil","original_name":"Jörg Theil","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7bb39e0e0a267c710099cc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480727,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christoph Sturm","original_name":"Christoph Sturm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7bb3b9c3a3681979008b78","department":"Editing","job":"Color Timer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67731,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Kaczmarek","original_name":"Michael Kaczmarek","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7bb3620e0a267c7d00ba59","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8640806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"227466841240946","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jjy4Fc2Sk7g5xIlt1kqmsLhFWn0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zSnktcz3wQx0H7jvLdujOgbNGjo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/LbiQ7zzgtAonRbHlJFaLmAa2V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/iXfn1bWTlksEUgYGpmRIdUxK3qE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Crossing Europe Film Festival","release_date":"2018-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOK Leipzig","release_date":"2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MONTAGS IN DRESDEN (MERKEL MUST GO) - Trailer","key":"Kk69kteJdVY","published_at":"2017-10-27T16:31:33.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b7bb4a492514101e000b54a"}]}}}
