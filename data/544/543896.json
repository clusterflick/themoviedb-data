Images of ruin and destruction from places that only recently were the scenes of fighting are transformed into a tragicomic parable of survival in a provisional space-time. Looting is a daily occurrence, and going out in search of booty becomes a boyish adventure during which the participants explore places only recently inhabited by private individuals. And when all this is recorded by a Polish television crew headed by a canny female reporter, an existential satire is born. The war is there, but somewhere around the corner.","popularity":0.0749,"poster_path":"/aUXKSMgVUdsm4X2omqRie3h9mH4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is a War, Baby","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2445231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuriy Pupyrin","original_name":"Yuriy Pupyrin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661ed8ba1cfe3a014a9ab9c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":897,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aUXKSMgVUdsm4X2omqRie3h9mH4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":645}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
