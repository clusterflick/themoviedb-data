His father would like him to lend a hand in their failing business. He falls in love with Divya. Neeraj calls off a marraige as he wants him to stand on his feet before getting married. Abhishek and Divya reluctantly agree and go their separate ways for a couple of years. Six months later, Divya comes to know that Abhishek is having an affair with her friend, Sakshi; that she is pregnant and wants to abort the child, and having failed to do so, kills herself. Divya and Neeraj are appalled at Abhishek's behavior, and Divya swears she will never have anything to do with him. What Divya and Neeraj do not know is that Abhishek is forced to maintain his silence - for a reason that may bring devastation to the Mehta family.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hum Jo Keh Na Paaye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0497626","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
