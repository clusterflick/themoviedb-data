Through its unlikely protagonists, the video considers how the pre-verbal child might represent a site of embodied knowledge. Using slow motion camera, mirrored surfaces and rhythmic editing, the video attempts to depict the complexities of their gesture, rhythm and movement through a process of defamiliarization. Going to the Mountain is an acute, unsentimental portrait of Nico, Grace and Maya, with a score developed in collaboration with Andrew Fogarty, featuring improvised percussion by David Lacey made in response to audio recordings of a 7 month old child as well as newly commissioned soft sculptures by artist Barbara Knezevic.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Going to the Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2110756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jenny Brady","original_name":"Jenny Brady","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b794418925141294c021a7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
