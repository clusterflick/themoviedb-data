Director Tasaka Naoko said: 'I'm pursuing something undistinguishable, with no name or with no boundaries, like something implied in a loose connection of the words in poetry. It's not an unknown thing. It's something which I already know but I donâ€˜t know how to describe. I search in my experience and recollection trying to rebuild something similar with the fragments of my memory.'","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/n3bQRRs1qYc5RaZJuM509DMnMpv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light Escapes Through the Intervals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1204988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naoko Tasaka","original_name":"Naoko Tasaka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7af642925141294e04786b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1074,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n3bQRRs1qYc5RaZJuM509DMnMpv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":717}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
