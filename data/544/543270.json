This image and its accompanying sound are subjected to increasingly complex and proliferating configurations to arrive at what Emshwiller calls a \"visual fugue\" in time and space, structured like musical or mathematical sequences. The walking figure and its de-synchronized footsteps are multiplied, slowed down, accelerated, reversed, syncopated, overlapped and otherwise altered in multifarious variations on a theme, building in a kinetic, almost narrative progression of compositional relationships. The screen is finally transformed into a dance of motion by male and female figures in an abstracted, colorized space. Rather than an analysis of movement a la Muybridge, Crossings and Meetings is a celebration of the potential for representing movement in time and space through video.","popularity":0.2465,"poster_path":"/ryLFRLrvv9gAgi1ozLlGlRGuHTL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crossings and Meetings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Godfrey","original_name":"John Godfrey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b79695cc3a36860ea02bdf1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Emshwiller","original_name":"Ed Emshwiller","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/fYkXS4etuNHwIaryNNDRydFFE0a.jpg","credit_id":"5b79692e925141295b02a341","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.652,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ryLFRLrvv9gAgi1ozLlGlRGuHTL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":626}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Knokke Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"1974-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
