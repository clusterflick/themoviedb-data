Doug James, standing on his porch nearby, heard the puppy’s cries and ran to help. He scared away the thugs and at the request of Gucci’s 15-year-old runaway owner, took the dog in for the night. Thus began a 16-year odyssey of devotion and perseverance.","popularity":0.1405,"poster_path":"/kONQKfVoUwo3nJg1haJmRK8bLlL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73994,"logo_path":null,"name":"What Were We Thinking Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Justice is a dog's best friend.","title":"A Dog Named Gucci","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2111134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug James","original_name":"Doug James","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b79ef350e0a26472b034eff","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2111136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kristine Bechard","original_name":"Kristine Bechard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b79f070c3a36860e1032b2f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357831,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sarah Hajtol","original_name":"Sarah Hajtol","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b79f02fc3a36860dd03e047","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gorman Bechard","original_name":"Gorman Bechard","popularity":0.1632,"profile_path":"/bpwfHFX1AH9BtLA1zQkh7Nytf0K.jpg","credit_id":"5b79f061c3a36860e6030e29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gorman Bechard","original_name":"Gorman Bechard","popularity":0.1632,"profile_path":"/bpwfHFX1AH9BtLA1zQkh7Nytf0K.jpg","credit_id":"5b79eff39251412949034cab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gorman Bechard","original_name":"Gorman Bechard","popularity":0.1632,"profile_path":"/bpwfHFX1AH9BtLA1zQkh7Nytf0K.jpg","credit_id":"5b79f0580e0a264736037a40","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gorman Bechard","original_name":"Gorman Bechard","popularity":0.1632,"profile_path":"/bpwfHFX1AH9BtLA1zQkh7Nytf0K.jpg","credit_id":"5b79f03bc3a36860ea036e06","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gorman Bechard","original_name":"Gorman Bechard","popularity":0.1632,"profile_path":"/bpwfHFX1AH9BtLA1zQkh7Nytf0K.jpg","credit_id":"5b79f07e0e0a264736037a59","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1108927,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dean Falcone","original_name":"Dean Falcone","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b79f047925141294c02f359","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3588852","wikidata_id":"Q21480304","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kONQKfVoUwo3nJg1haJmRK8bLlL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Big Sky Documentary Festival","release_date":"2015-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A DOG NAMED GUCCI - trailer 2","key":"A-pAtLDeTOU","published_at":"2014-04-01T19:24:59.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b79efc1c3a36860e1032a9e"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A DOG NAMED GUCCI - trailer #1","key":"vv2cNA_cbyM","published_at":"2013-04-14T05:28:46.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b79efa4925141295b034173"}]}}}
