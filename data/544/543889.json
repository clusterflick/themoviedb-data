With her career as a concert pianist gaining momentum, it seems her beauty and talent will be strong enough to mask the demons that threaten to engulf her. But with an absent husband and two young daughters at home, her precarious sanity begins to unravel until one summer day, burning with manic energy, she makes a terrible mistake â€” a mistake that will change her life forever. The consequences for Maura are catastrophic: her ambitious husband runs for his life, taking the children with him, leaving Maura to lapse into a full-scale breakdown. Life as she knew it is now over. With the help of her father, Ian, Maura works to reclaim her life and waits for a miracle to bring her daughters home. But when the fates align, can the past be forgiven?","popularity":1.1257,"poster_path":"/e5MPJTwEPDjdVwifFFO3nKaFVZH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148114,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wreckhouse Productions","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":11065,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Film Works","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Audience of Chairs","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1447280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolina Bartczak","original_name":"Carolina Bartczak","popularity":0.2319,"profile_path":"/tQumydKvy6B2egz70Yd73kgokyP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maura","credit_id":"5b7d757dc3a3685909010a3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter MacNeill","original_name":"Peter MacNeill","popularity":0.4114,"profile_path":"/9Y2O97Awq5BUH3qfWL3EUveurqI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ian","credit_id":"5b7d759d925141414f00fbde","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gord Rand","original_name":"Gord Rand","popularity":0.3191,"profile_path":"/tv4RPO2Ga5z2sWWvCQoLW5wCFxo.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ben","credit_id":"5b7d75b60e0a263bcf010ccd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1590230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edie Inksetter","original_name":"Edie Inksetter","popularity":0.3952,"profile_path":"/kIJVcF4YYMS4UQFqrSIZyGYpRPq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Paula","credit_id":"5b7d75cd0e0a263bca01065e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Jacot","original_name":"Christopher Jacot","popularity":0.2632,"profile_path":"/988yC8uMpunCzIVCNUv8AyzbWIA.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Duncan","credit_id":"5b7d75e0c3a36858fe00d6f3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1197115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Corbett","original_name":"Kate Corbett","popularity":0.2139,"profile_path":"/rZo6amh0aOJq2SFcBxXHuL2CacY.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Bonnie","credit_id":"6503c68263aad200e12ce59f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1807976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexis Koetting","original_name":"Alexis Koetting","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/ae77HCTqOsX9PHTdRgQCXEffQaI.jpg","cast_id":47,"character":"Reporter","credit_id":"6578b137f04d01011e0fbaff","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1670066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruth Lawrence","original_name":"Ruth Lawrence","popularity":0.403,"profile_path":"/ff2S8pYLxebjTceEBpTpqJN9FwM.jpg","cast_id":48,"character":"Florist","credit_id":"6578b143af58cb01236c70e6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3630626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Ryan","original_name":"Terry Ryan","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":"/dQ9FfpPAomiUqTfoILBYNDQqaQo.jpg","cast_id":55,"character":"Bartender","credit_id":"66e05b9f4c25805f3bba32a4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4934385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Keeping","original_name":"Grace Keeping","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":53,"character":"Young Bonnie","credit_id":"66e049ef18d1fffc464f792b","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4426487,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andrew Jerrett","original_name":"Andrew Jerrett","popularity":0.154,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6578ae7620ecaf00ad8681f7","department":"Crew","job":"Transportation Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2801037,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Justin A.
