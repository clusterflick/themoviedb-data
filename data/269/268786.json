In reality, the roll was to be awarded to Lu Panther, the untalented girlfriend of the theatre's owner, Wildner.  After a series of accidents and little disasters, Wildner shuts down the theatre before the Revue can take place.  But the Revue's director, Ernst Eder, decides shortly thereafter to present the Revue on an ice skating rink belonging to Liesl's uncle.  After a successful run, at first at the Wiener Prater, the performers move on to Spain, Hungary, and a night club with a Jazz orchestra.  The Revue becomes a huge success ... and, of course, Ernst and Liesl end up together, too.","popularity":0.2876,"poster_path":"/rotP4BRxxg7znd8aoTzifpNw0Hk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wien-Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1943-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der weiße Traum","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Снежная фантазия","type":"Russian title in the USSR"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1317700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olly Holzmann","original_name":"Olly Holzmann","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/4nvSlKWANLKuRIBWKaIA0lau0vM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Liesl Strolz","credit_id":"536bdb1a0e0a2647c400c79a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolf Albach-Retty","original_name":"Wolf Albach-Retty","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/4hh5ZAV3C7FQ2g4SOngiVkWoiJq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ernst Eder","credit_id":"536bdb260e0a2647ce00c082","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Imhoff","original_name":"Fritz Imhoff","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/tdHjJ9ZiIygE53VeJY25dP7VTiT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Meister Strolz","credit_id":"536bdb350e0a2647c400c79f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oskar Sima","original_name":"Oskar Sima","popularity":0.2405,"profile_path":"/bQDZxEXLpQ2voIxflksqYzTF8uV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Josef Wildner","credit_id":"536bdb430e0a2647c800c979","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Carl","original_name":"Rudolf Carl","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/dssc7XtL5zSIiGpzOKtuKtIJFFo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Toni","credit_id":"536bdb530e0a2647ce00c089","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1134553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotte Lang","original_name":"Lotte Lang","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/lqH5mVefQn87pqHhr1jMnbIEM2G.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Lu Panther","credit_id":"5ecc79fee2bca8001e898342","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Olden","original_name":"Hans Olden","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/nxyG2jwoQBzoCiQHibWweC9VdEj.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Direktor Schmoller","credit_id":"5ecc7a1b19690c001c6fc68b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Eybner","original_name":"Richard Eybner","popularity":0.1191,"profile_path":"/1PxynRRNf6YXPiuAUERwpdhsYq9.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Scherzinger","credit_id":"5ecc7a51e2bca8001e898440","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodor Danegger","original_name":"Theodor Danegger","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Onkel Strolz (scenes deleted)","credit_id":"5ecc7a71e2bca8001f895e58","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1025524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Schott-Schöbinger","original_name":"Hans Schott-Schöbinger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Theo Berg","credit_id":"5ecc7a93e2bca8002089af99","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Lorenz","original_name":"Georg Lorenz","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Franz","credit_id":"5ecc7aab021cee002189c3ef","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1957000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petra Trautmann","original_name":"Petra Trautmann","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Gertie Kramer","credit_id":"5ecc7ac435818f0020c02ae2","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Hartmann","original_name":"Otto Hartmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Poldi","credit_id":"5ecc7ae6e2bca8001e8985b4","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Kern","original_name":"Hans Kern","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Bächlein","credit_id":"5ecc7b0035818f0021c0106c","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Polly Koß","original_name":"Polly Koß","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Frau Wulitsch","credit_id":"5ecc7b1de2bca8001f895fa4","order":14},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Menschik","original_name":"Josef Menschik","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Kugler -
