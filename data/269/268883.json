A well-intentioned Christian gives in to the temptation of a young widow: a mayor succumbs to his greed: an elderly lady adopts a young burn victim: a doctor breaks away from a past that had hardened her heart: an old priest comes and goes trying to understand and a lost poet rediscovers his capacity to love and write. All these passions come together in a yearning to give meaning to their lives.","popularity":0.4007,"poster_path":"/8VqHiTNb44UCelMysA9GFzUNwyc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2010-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A través del silencio","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Through the Silence","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gonzalo Vega","original_name":"Gonzalo Vega","popularity":0.148,"profile_path":"/kPz5ICDol74lJ6vmsJDgkw7D7AP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"536c726b0e0a2647d800d265","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Owen","original_name":"Lisa Owen","popularity":0.4285,"profile_path":"/t6u25UXmZ3DgXt0wxwFQxz6wuNu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"536c72760e0a2647c800d63d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomás Rojas","original_name":"Tomás Rojas","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"536c727f0e0a2647db00ce95","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1031256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erando González","original_name":"Erando González","popularity":0.1257,"profile_path":"/dqF8Mc7hyEwWN2rObfXAiH0ZXqa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"536c72870e0a2647c400d43b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Torres","original_name":"Harold Torres","popularity":0.2504,"profile_path":"/lOAED2Que041vtPP0bKuBYE2xVr.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"536c728f0e0a2647d800d268","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martín Zapata","original_name":"Martín Zapata","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/n3QI8Nm9cP5GrMdbqO919kNfT7g.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"536c72960e0a2647cb00d24f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":947184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariana Gajá","original_name":"Mariana Gajá","popularity":0.1898,"profile_path":"/kzAngKZLp0xiSkU1cLxTFjngdWx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"536c729e0e0a2647d400cf22","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raquel Vega","original_name":"Raquel Vega","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"536c72a40e0a2647d100ccb0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejandra Álvarez","original_name":"Alejandra Álvarez","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"536c72a90e0a2647cb00d254","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317832,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Javier Sicilia","original_name":"Javier Sicilia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536c723f0e0a2647c800d635","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Sisniega","original_name":"Marcel Sisniega","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536c724d0e0a2647c400d433","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Sisniega","original_name":"Marcel Sisniega","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536c72ca0e0a2647d100ccc3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1645034","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8VqHiTNb44UCelMysA9GFzUNwyc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":658}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
