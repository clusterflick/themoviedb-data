Despite having made a great mural for the metro station Palais Royal – Musée du Louvre, Santos lives isolated and ignored in his country. This documentary follows his pilgrimage to Wirikuta, where he asks gods for permission to make a new mural; his journey across 385 miles of the Peyote Route, and Santos's creative process during the making of a new mural which aims to illustrate the history, mythology and religious traditions of the Huichol people.","popularity":0.1281,"poster_path":"/iJzHS0LXCeOUZu02o8nNjwpgcHo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152194,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cuadro
