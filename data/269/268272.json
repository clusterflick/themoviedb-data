With visions of finally living the American Dream, the charismatic Ortiz launches a complete makeover. He dons Obama’s trademark suit, adopts his mannerisms, mimics his voice and steps out onto the street as a presidential impersonator. Taken on by a casting agent, Ortiz and a gang of other political impersonators, including a Bill Clinton and a Mitt Romney, hit the road during the run-up to the 2012 presidential election to perform satirical debates for mostly Republican conventions, throwing Ortiz into conflict with his personal political beliefs. As Ortiz struggles to make ends meet, the distance between the White House and the Bronx becomes increasingly acute. The life of a president isn’t always as easy as it looks.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":"/yCU3i9iEeImWMdDzJXaonm4kea1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bronx Obama","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Murdock","original_name":"Ryan Murdock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536791b00e0a2647d800583c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3260514","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yCU3i9iEeImWMdDzJXaonm4kea1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bronx Obama (Trailer @ CPH:DOX 2014)","key":"lANFL0IMWvI","published_at":"2014-10-15T21:21:49.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"5ab4f165c3a368616301e1b6"}]}}}
