The film takes a keen look at a spectrum of topics like alien abduction, human/alien hybridization, the military's reverse-engineering of alien technology and the government cover-up of anything related to extraterrestrials. Is preoccupation with E.T.'s a form of cultural madness, or is something really going on? How would E.T. contact change the religious and political institutions of our society? The Hidden Hand is full of riveting interviews with experts and experiencers alike: Whitley Strieber, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, the 6th astronaut on the moon, Paul Hellyer, a former Canadian Defence Minister, Richard Dolan, Jim Marrs, Linda Moulton Howe, Col. John Alexander, Lyn Buchanan, Clifford Stone, Nassim Haramein, David Icke, Dr. Roger Leir, Graham Hancock and Paola Harris, among others. The shadowy world of UFOs is suddenly brought to light.","popularity":0.2838,"poster_path":"/pv1rY7NQ30cHo1xmysCm1SOYcrK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hidden Hand: Alien Contact and the Government Cover-up","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32404,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Carman","original_name":"James Carman","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576dfe7a9251412f010008c2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32404,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Carman","original_name":"James Carman","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576dfe749251416cae002308","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32404,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Carman","original_name":"James Carman","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576dfe81c3a368567400245e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32404,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Carman","original_name":"James Carman","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576dfe6ac3a3682e17000996","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32404,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Carman","original_name":"James Carman","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576dfe61c3a368567900230e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1859604","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2OntY5hlVnw5ZJf92YF2jElsJvv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pv1rY7NQ30cHo1xmysCm1SOYcrK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9951,"name":"alien"},{"id":9853,"name":"paranormal"},{"id":9738,"name":"ufo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
