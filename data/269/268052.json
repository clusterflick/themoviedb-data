Although not an overtly political work, for many viewers it raises sensitive issues about race, homoeroticism and violence. It depicts two naked men – one of whom is the artist – tussling and teasing one another in an encounter which shifts between tenderness and aggression. The film is silent but a series of stares, glances and winks between the protagonists creates an optical language of flirtation and threat.","popularity":0.1413,"poster_path":"/cNmyFK2C1xHMn0vF37tkWFeBbU1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bear","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve McQueen","original_name":"Steve McQueen","popularity":0.4663,"profile_path":"/if4tLIZJ0EJtyhlJaSzSwMQU5Yz.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5365538cc3a368122000183f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Douglas","original_name":"Vernon Douglas","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"53655405c3a3681220001847","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve McQueen","original_name":"Steve McQueen","popularity":0.4663,"profile_path":"/if4tLIZJ0EJtyhlJaSzSwMQU5Yz.jpg","credit_id":"536553aac3a368124a001909","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2552386","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":918,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7KsY5KUOzUNfeeyExEvqTUQvrxZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":612},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":870,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cNmyFK2C1xHMn0vF37tkWFeBbU1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
