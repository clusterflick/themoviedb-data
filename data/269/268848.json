Born in Anglès, Spain, in 1908, Remedios was marked by two wars (Spanish Civil War and the Second World War) and for an intense relationship of amour fou with the poet Benjamin Péret who considered her his muse and the woman of his dreams. Exiled in Mexico from 1941 until her death in 1963, she developed in this country the pictorial imagery and the technical virtuoso which identify her as a weaver of dreams in a world of medieval reminiscences, populated by creatures and fantastic objects connected with the cosmos.","popularity":0.144,"poster_path":"/6GzNgp6ZvDIlLf1GHnad9Uc65me.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remedios Varo: Mystery and Revelation","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliana González","original_name":"Juliana González","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"536c218c0e0a2647c400cd4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tere Arcq","original_name":"Tere Arcq","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"536c21940e0a2647db00c7e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Blanco","original_name":"Alberto Blanco","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"536c219d0e0a2647d400c865","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Varsoviano","original_name":"Alexandra Varsoviano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"536c21a50e0a2647d800cb95","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Gruen","original_name":"Walter Gruen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"536c21af0e0a2647cb00cbec","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Glass","original_name":"Alan Glass","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"536c21b70e0a2647d100c5b0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonora Carrington","original_name":"Leonora Carrington","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/w5SLOlsxgHCwqgaXbj8pDW5MYq4.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"536c21bc0e0a2647ce00c5ee","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tufic Makhlouf Akl","original_name":"Tufic Makhlouf Akl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536c21600e0a2647d100c5a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317751,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Enrique R.
