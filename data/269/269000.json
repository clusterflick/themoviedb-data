This film portrays the exploitation and misery of the Spanish peasants, but also their class-consciousness and their will to fight for their rights and freedom. The film was shot in the late years of Franco's dictatorship, so it was made in secrecy (the directors were connected to the Spanish Communist Party).","popularity":0.2429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":56868,"logo_path":null,"name":"Colectivo Cine de Clase","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El campo para el hombre","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Lumbreras","original_name":"Helena Lumbreras","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536d3cb30e0a2647db00dd1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2587982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Lisa","original_name":"Mariano Lisa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e871270af58cb0012e2c2cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0255024","wikidata_id":"Q61770250","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5882,"name":"franco regime (francoism)"},{"id":11004,"name":"rural area"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
