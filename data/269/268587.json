You want to take them on the trip of a doggie lifetime, but where do you go and what do you do? In this “dog-umentary,” filmmaker and animal shaman Billie Dean and her filmmaker husband Andrew Einspruch bundle their seven rescued dogs from Ballyoncree and hit the road on a journey of discovery. Because humans aren’t the only ones who need to smell the roses. Filmed in some of Australia’s most beautiful places, and shot by AFI Award winning cinematograhper Anthony Jennings, the documentary follows Suki, Louie, Tala, Twylah, Cedar, Willow, and Raffi as they do everything from stay in five-star resort accommodation to taking a horse-drawn gypsy caravan ride. It’s the trip of a doggie lifetime.","popularity":0.0974,"poster_path":"/oaEpU3kRaqwWjAA2ypCIKagXngC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":253911,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wild Pure Heart
