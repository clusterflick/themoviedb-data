For eight months you are surrounded by churning seas and wide open skies. All the responsibilities of navigation, repair and survival rest on your shoulders twenty-four hours a day. Does this sound fun, or crazy? To some people like the Around Alone sailors, it sounds downright irresistible. Throughout recorded history, more people have traveled into space than have sailed around the world alone, the ultimate test of seamanship and courage. BORN TO THE WIND captures the human drama of sixteen sailors as they set sail from Charleston, South Carolina in the Around Alone 1998-99 Race.","popularity":0.1781,"poster_path":"/1lTtEDuWPP9T4oHcRMmzxyy7DQo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8477,"logo_path":null,"name":"George Pal Productions, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Born to the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Fonda","original_name":"Peter Fonda","popularity":0.6214,"profile_path":"/dgorN06SQ9ZNL2NY3I7BNxg93lc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5366a681c3a3681226003434","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2313471,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ian Hinkle","original_name":"Ian Hinkle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b6250319690c0061c42c1a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"László Pal","original_name":"László Pal","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5366a65cc3a36812200034fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"László Pal","original_name":"László Pal","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5366a49ac3a36812200034b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1836756","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1lTtEDuWPP9T4oHcRMmzxyy7DQo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1070}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
