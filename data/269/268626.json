The stories of four detainees and the doctors involved in their abuse demonstrate how US Army and CIA doctors implemented the Enhanced Interrogation Techniques and covered up signs of torture at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. Interviews with medical, legal and intelligence experts and evidence from declassified government memos document what has been called the greatest scandal in American medical ethics. Based on four years of research by Producer/Director Martha Davis, written by Oscar winning Mark Jonathan Harris, and filmed in HD by Emmy winning DP Lisa Rinzler, the film shows how the torture of detainees could not continue without the assistance of the doctors.","popularity":0.9141,"poster_path":"/pr5o8szoXoFFGurL0URciQNOwZj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctors of the Dark Side","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane Davis","original_name":"Diane Davis","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/u3P7iqD9Z17pOwHLEQYklVpB0Mq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Instructor","credit_id":"614106e556b9f70028830b7a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1532630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Aaron Rosen","original_name":"Lee Aaron Rosen","popularity":0.2111,"profile_path":"/96Lyig35wpEr0qSVgZjNPtPBYHn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Instructor","credit_id":"6141070060c751002af53432","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1454352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gian-Murray Gianino","original_name":"Gian-Murray Gianino","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Detainee","credit_id":"614107239450fe008ec83477","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mercedes Ruehl","original_name":"Mercedes Ruehl","popularity":0.452,"profile_path":"/hdqoxwtAAVdu0d7cnuePeNdtVCC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6141074d9979d2006759acf1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Jonathan Harris","original_name":"Mark Jonathan Harris","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6141078caf85de002a268e49","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Davis","original_name":"Martha Davis","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5563d379c3a36806c80004fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2006722","wikidata_id":"Q16249949","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ooBXnsOJdIzbROIgU6c8TWPveqQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8HoK7SmX2VAd7RjddT2DZOTomsg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/oFE9zXPFq61KLMBgNzRFQyDpAiE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pr5o8szoXoFFGurL0URciQNOwZj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1057}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":591,"name":"central intelligence agency (cia)"},{"id":1327,"name":"war crimes"},{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":3692,"name":"scandal"},{"id":13006,"name":"torture"},{"id":185740,"name":"ethical dilemma"},{"id":191103,"name":"torturer"},{"id":215664,"name":"political scandal"},{"id":228164,"name":"torture victim"},{"id":229777,"name":"expert opinion"},{"id":238840,"name":"medical scandal"},{"id":281050,"name":"legal scandal"},{"id":307587,"name":"crime documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
