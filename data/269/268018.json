If you work full time, you should not be poor, but more than 30 million Americans - one in four workers - are stuck in low wage jobs that do not provide the basics for a decent life. WAGING A LIVING chronicles the battle of four low-wage workers to lift their families out of poverty. Shot over a three-year period in the northeast and California, this observational documentary captures the dreams, frustrations, and accomplishments of a diverse group of workers who struggle to live from paycheck to paycheck. By presenting an unvarnished look at the barriers that these workers must overcome to escape poverty, WAGING A LIVING offers a sobering view of the elusive American Dream.","popularity":0.1401,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waging A Living","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112171,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Weisberg","original_name":"Roger Weisberg","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5ee996fd7aa4003bec70c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0455834","wikidata_id":"Q7959574","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
