With his charismatic personality, he convinced the Allies to give him a newspaper license. A radio magazine soon follows, which quickly reaches millions of copies. His greatest publishing invention is a daily newspaper with which he wants to give the common man on the street a voice. But the publisher is not only successful in business, he also knows how to please women.","popularity":0.5975,"poster_path":"/zwxTe8Jg1uJITgPF6rQzt0N38xv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der
