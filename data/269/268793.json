From the moment it rises, animals are waiting, ready to take advantage of the opportunities that the sun creates. A quirky chameleon uses solar power to survive, while a family of lemurs get a morning heat fix. But, as the day progresses and the sun climbs higher in the sky, becoming more powerful, animals must also react as it pushes them toward moments of crisis.  As the sun sets and its great heat and light are extinguished, a night-time world wakes, full of characters who have carved a niche in the darkness. But even in the dead of night, the sun is not lost. Its rays are reflected in the moon, our 'ghost sun.'  We take the rising and setting of the sun for granted, but it is the ultimate game changer. The way the natural world responds will be the difference between success and failure, life or death.","popularity":0.1439,"poster_path":"/3xHOXuG9nScqmCkieY1WJVEpKF2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"24 Hours on Earth","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"24 heures sur la Terre - L'aube et le jour","type":"Première partie française"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"24 heures sur la Terre - Le crépuscule et la nuit","type":"Deuxième partie française"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Macfadyen","original_name":"Matthew Macfadyen","popularity":1.6773,"profile_path":"/wjzFvujqF5KuHoIGLOjk6FCiSYJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5d5666f6bc86574b372da10e","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3682608","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Kcr2fvEexOAk7D3AWxpmTeR7FN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1122NwHCi49H5rAd46IVxVu4y91.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/zTRrShL9G0nzlTNEChGZnecwaMY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":0.949,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/wXIrNVsgb2M1l8BMRVW5zuXe9xI.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":854}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/3xHOXuG9nScqmCkieY1WJVEpKF2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3sdwCwXbhWgrluHuMS8AOY7klx3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Partie 1 : \"L'aube et le jour\"","release_date":"2015-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Partie 2 : \"Le crépuscule et la nuit\"","release_date":"2015-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC One","release_date":"2014-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Chameleon solar panel - 24 Hours of Earth: Preview - BBC One","key":"DybDEV4kIeI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2014-04-17T20:01:20.000Z","id":"6122e257e194b0002c5cb224"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hyrax sunshield - 24 Hours on Earth: Preview - BBC One","key":"P3FKlsbqQVU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2014-04-17T19:59:15.000Z","id":"6122e2603a96500046eaf278"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jellyfish lake - 24 Hours on Earth: Preview - BBC One","key":"zzfliwW9N1A","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2014-04-17T19:58:25.000Z","id":"6122e2450f2fbd00818da1b3"}]}}}
