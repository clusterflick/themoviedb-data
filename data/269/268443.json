At 7.15 am, on 30th June 1908, a giant fireball, as bright the sun, exploded in the sky over Tunguska in central Siberia. Its force was equivalent to twenty million tonnes of TNT, and a thousand times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. An estimated sixty million trees were felled over an area of over two thousand square kilometres - an area over half the size of Rhode Island. If the explosion had occurred over London or Paris, hundreds of thousands of people would have been killed.","popularity":0.2939,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Siberian Apocalypse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":207792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Verklan","original_name":"Laura Verklan","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64529ec8d861af0155e451ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293057,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eric Amdahl","original_name":"Eric Amdahl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64529efbd8f44e0db32320c5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1728505,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chris Laine","original_name":"Chris Laine","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64529ee0091e620102778569","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1156463","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5096,"name":"natural disaster"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
