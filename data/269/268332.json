He doesn't have money enough for the passage to Ireland, but the band members decide to incorporate him, advancing him the fare for equal shares in the estate. In Ireland, Danny finds that his is only a half-share, and the other half belongs to Mavourneen Kerrigan and she has the exclusive right to sell or keep the property...which, despite his pleas, she refuses to do. She also declares him an undesired guest, objects to his presence and insists that he prepare his own meals. He does so in a large main hall, but can only make hamburgers.","popularity":0.5715,"poster_path":"/vYm9ruxyT8dd0iYnnZGMIbeZBeG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1938-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"IT'S HEAVEN ON EARTH..When Boy Meets Girl On The Airy Acres of Rollicking Romance...JUST OUSIDE OF PARADISE","title":"Outside of Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Regan","original_name":"Phil Regan","popularity":0.2884,"profile_path":"/nvUcH9MwZMwlAzU4YxKVQGET5dw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Daniel 'Danny' Francis O'Toole","credit_id":"53688f220e0a2647db0076e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penny Singleton","original_name":"Penny Singleton","popularity":0.5387,"profile_path":"/ktpBMwMcqYTp1GubbVnAtZfzSKt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Colleen Kerrigan","credit_id":"53688f300e0a2647cb007914","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":193769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Gordon","original_name":"Bert Gordon","popularity":0.0727,"profile_path":"/rFXshopnnuGGFyGnTdwHe4yQexr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mischa","credit_id":"53688f3b0e0a2647c4007a46","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonid Kinskey","original_name":"Leonid Kinskey","popularity":0.3443,"profile_path":"/e5WkDoFos1oolme2fbKNa6wgGqe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cafe Owner Ivan Petrovich","credit_id":"53688f450e0a2647d1007603","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1048671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Coleman","original_name":"Ruth Coleman","popularity":0.209,"profile_path":"/lALtd2xOEevQCvIiPknOkxkEc7L.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dorothy Stonewall","credit_id":"53688f4f0e0a2647c4007a4b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Forbes","original_name":"Mary Forbes","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/isDdXLe2kV64u5ZwhKnPiSsTczy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Stonewall","credit_id":"53688f5a0e0a2647cb007918","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Pape","original_name":"Lionel Pape","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mr. Stonewall","credit_id":"53688f640e0a2647db0076e8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Remley","original_name":"Ralph Remley","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Timothy","credit_id":"53688f710e0a2647d400755b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":164779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renie Riano","original_name":"Renie Riano","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/cJ7JbpWddFgvuNC1cDghMFH4TOG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ellen","credit_id":"53688f7a0e0a2647c8007a86","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Lind Hayes","original_name":"Peter Lind Hayes","popularity":0.1459,"profile_path":"/cKqSRLnxga6bsVZzkic7ckhqp1d.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lind","credit_id":"53688f870e0a2647c4007a54","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe E.
