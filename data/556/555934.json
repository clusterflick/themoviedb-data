BT Sport ambassador, and former Ireland and British & Irish Lions captain Brian Oâ€™Driscoll, takes viewers on a powerful journey as he explores how Irish rugby manages to navigate and nurture a successful team through the years of violence that have claimed the lives of more than 3,500 people.  Ireland has been divided not just on a map but by politics, history and religion. However, the Irish Rugby Union has continued to be the governing body of rugby, leading to the remarkable situation of players from two countries competing as one.","popularity":0.2165,"poster_path":"/jajyGe5OSbDOW9Fhjb5B3651XZL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65389,"logo_path":null,"name":"BT Sport
