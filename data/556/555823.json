As his host looks very much like a vagrant the peasant dubs him 'Pousse-Pierre'. Actually Pousse-Pierre will prove very handy since he will save Miette, the farmer's daughter, and manage - at the risk of his own life - to have the murderer of a miller arrested. His superior reinstates him and the young man can marry Miette.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1921-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Une brute","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2158433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Bompard","original_name":"Daniel Bompard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bce962c92514172d8004c08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0759503","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1921-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
