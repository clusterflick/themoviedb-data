Bonkers and Lucky are assigned with finding Mickey, with the latter being promised a promotion if they do, and they decide to start their search at Corkscrew Studios (which has been adorned appropriately to welcome Mickey). While searching through the studio, Lucky suggests that they stop searching until a ransom note is discovered, but a nearby janitor tells him that there isn't going to be any note. Bonkers recognizes the janitor as Babyface, a washed-up former child star notorious for his obnoxious ego.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/bx4GPVt1XMDvYaX0B6F7NgjmOuy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bonkers 2 - I Oughta Be in Toons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bx4GPVt1XMDvYaX0B6F7NgjmOuy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1994-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
