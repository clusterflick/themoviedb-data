Alone in the heart of the polar winter battling with the Arctic ice pack and its ruthless laws, Michael turns to the techniques, know-how and reflexes of the Inuits who have thrived in the Arctic for thousands of years. A story of the human journey, Call of the Ice is a film about learning, with its failures and pain, but also victories in the face of adversity.","popularity":0.1025,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call of the Ice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106137,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mike Magidson","original_name":"Mike Magidson","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/v97iWtoJ2AwoNGsAyoaCeRUYrIh.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bcca10a0e0a26015100c082","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106137,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mike Magidson","original_name":"Mike Magidson","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/v97iWtoJ2AwoNGsAyoaCeRUYrIh.jpg","credit_id":"5bcca127925141613100b9a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899856,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philippe Molins","original_name":"Philippe Molins","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bcca180c3a368286d00ca6f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106137,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mike Magidson","original_name":"Mike Magidson","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/v97iWtoJ2AwoNGsAyoaCeRUYrIh.jpg","credit_id":"5bcca150c3a368286d00ca2f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899855,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caroline Broussaud","original_name":"Caroline Broussaud","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bcca1680e0a26016e00c02a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q27703223","facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":""},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
