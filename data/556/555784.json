An experiential film on neocolonial Philippines’ interpretation of Saints and Gods through many forms of rituals and iconographies, exposing wood as raw material that undergoes production processes before becoming a spiritual object of devotion.  -  A sculpture believed to have been imported in town during Spanish colonial conquest, locally known as Mahal na Señor Sepulcro, is celebrating its 500 years. Meanwhile, composed of non-actors, Senakulo re-enacts the sufferings and death of Jesus. As the local community yearly unites to commemorate the Passion of Christ, a laborious journey unfolds following local craftsmen in transforming blocks of wood into a larger than life Jesus crucified on a 12-ft cross.","popularity":0.7375,"poster_path":"/swdp3Mau0x6NkUfkkbEAcPfTYz4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Turumpo Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2018-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carving Thy Faith","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2158390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiyas Baldemor Bagabaldo","original_name":"Hiyas Baldemor Bagabaldo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/abZqpwzGJ6gzInorFCp3qAWrrEE.jpg","credit_id":"606c7b88ad59b5006e22ae63","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2158390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiyas Baldemor Bagabaldo","original_name":"Hiyas Baldemor Bagabaldo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/abZqpwzGJ6gzInorFCp3qAWrrEE.jpg","credit_id":"606c7b8fd29bdd005726b3dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2158390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiyas Baldemor Bagabaldo","original_name":"Hiyas Baldemor Bagabaldo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/abZqpwzGJ6gzInorFCp3qAWrrEE.jpg","credit_id":"5bce89f10e0a266242003fbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6410114","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iLOJEgCKuTZ9cYGoIwDs13RPEMl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2700,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/swdp3Mau0x6NkUfkkbEAcPfTYz4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1909}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":4720,"name":"ritual"},{"id":2131,"name":"visual arts"},{"id":6895,"name":"philippines"},{"id":10983,"name":"anthropology"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":154874,"name":"imagery"},{"id":157171,"name":"nonlinear timeline"},{"id":158217,"name":"colonialism"},{"id":161207,"name":"catholicism"},{"id":161508,"name":"iconography"},{"id":162710,"name":"culture"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":194369,"name":"post-colonial"},{"id":201769,"name":"observational cinema"},{"id":204233,"name":"ethnographical"},{"id":209463,"name":"neo-colonialism"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"},{"id":226261,"name":"folk art"},{"id":237188,"name":"ethnography"},{"id":238875,"name":"audio visual experience"},{"id":253012,"name":"hispanic monarchy (spanish empire)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Carving Thy Faith - 2019 Film Trailer","key":"343921672","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-06-23T11:55:16.000Z","id":"5d0f6d3b0e0a263d93ca8065"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PAG-UKIT SA PANINIWALA - QCinema 2018","key":"_V58MK-Z1H8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-09-22T08:35:07.000Z","id":"5d0f2ad49251417099bd24f1"}]}}}
