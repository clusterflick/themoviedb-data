It is the case of three-year-old Marcelle Monfort who sees her mother die suddenly in a public garden while her ruined father is on his way to America. Taken in by Madame Jalin, a washerwoman, Marcelle grows up enduring the jealousy of Louise, Madame Jalin's daughter. Having had enough of the situation Marcelle leaves home and soon gets ill. Fortunately, she benefits for a time from Mademoiselle de Beaurenon's compassionate support. But her troubles are not over yet, for her benefactor dies and she is kicked out of home by the good lady's greedy relatives who think they are her heirs. Rose, the old domestic, takes care of Marcelle until, at long last, luck takes a turn for the better. Not only does her father come back from the USA but Madame de Beaurenon also leaves her all her assets.","popularity":0.1041,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1919-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perdue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Alexandre","original_name":"René Alexandre","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/eo2lDk1nH6P3Fh4IEeu4dNRgcVw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1fd3e169e365af69fb0fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Fromet","original_name":"Maria Fromet","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/gvGXJPWX4yNfWm1Ii2JtAiUv26k.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1fd50169e365af69fb10d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1342397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Barbieri","original_name":"Gina Barbieri","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/1gT7NVtsqij0bMZNlhcA1JiJpAH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1fd624e89ccd7886dba9a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1499633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Relly","original_name":"Gina Relly","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1fd757294be98a8e0e11f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5250462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilberte Haziza","original_name":"Gilberte Haziza","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1fd2b536958672b9fb0b8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Monca","original_name":"Georges Monca","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bce56ecc3a36829fd0006e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5250464,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henry Greville","original_name":"Henry Greville","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b1fdbbe5e1a7ed7ce0e0ab","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Monca","original_name":"Georges Monca","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b1fdd9e5e1a7ed7ce0e0af","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0200952","wikidata_id":"Q18633914","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1919-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
