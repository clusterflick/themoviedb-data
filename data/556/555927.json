His featured film Rani radovi (Early Works) got to trial, because it made important politicians, including Tito himself, very angry. However, it was free of all charges, thanks to the really honorable judge. The Golden Bear, the prime award of the Berlin Film Festival, was given to Zelimir and it was interpreted as the biggest provocation for socialist Yugoslavia. Therefore, the film was put away for years and was not available for the audience.","popularity":0.1863,"poster_path":"/cW8cmDgB8yqWffLnNkPXaimFtVW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28394,"logo_path":"/uayh0bscJCf5StAz27R0XRyZKuj.png","name":"Art & Popcorn","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2007-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Do Those Lunatics Want?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Želimir Žilnik","original_name":"Želimir Žilnik","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/iRED1Q2iwyXkmh2odTAbOotZGQc.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bcf514d92514172cd01412d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495252,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Milan Nikodijević","original_name":"Milan Nikodijević","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bcf51690e0a26623d017a50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dinko Tucaković","original_name":"Dinko Tucaković","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bcf517192514172d80141c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495252,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Milan Nikodijević","original_name":"Milan Nikodijević","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bcf5177c3a3686643018433","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dinko Tucaković","original_name":"Dinko Tucaković","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bcf517e92514172d80141d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3293106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cW8cmDgB8yqWffLnNkPXaimFtVW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
