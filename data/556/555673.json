The show is a sum of apparently separate scenes that show the human struggle and the desire for affection. Misunderstandings and clumsiness determine our interactions with each other, while meanwhile there is always the consciousness that love will bring us the deepest happiness. But affection is always present. The characters in this show fail, but ultimately they find an answer in the simplicity of the moment.","popularity":0.1477,"poster_path":"/62Omy2nEFMJitXO3EUhiGl2Ud43.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127187,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hekwerk
