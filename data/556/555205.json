Many jobs came through the Clairton Coke Works Plant. Coke is used in the process of making steel. As decades went on, citizens began experiencing asthma problems, lung cancer, and many deaths in their families. The effects of air pollution in violation of EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) regulations became persistent in every household; many relocated. However, those who stay with the help of PennFuture want to put an end to these violations and regain their community.","popularity":0.3065,"poster_path":"/7KszdQ5oWyYCVQv4PiIB9hk7mUZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clairton Coke Works, Clean Up Our Air","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2155978,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ben Karpinski","original_name":"Ben Karpinski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bcb705c92514155a40019e2","department":"Camera","job":"Drone Pilot"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2155976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Brosey","original_name":"Matt Brosey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oBAQ1QkNVKkyWG0wAvZQce9VZtf.jpg","credit_id":"5bcb704a0e0a2627a3001fbb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2155976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Brosey","original_name":"Matt Brosey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oBAQ1QkNVKkyWG0wAvZQce9VZtf.jpg","credit_id":"5bcb7040c3a3682396001fea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2155976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Brosey","original_name":"Matt Brosey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oBAQ1QkNVKkyWG0wAvZQce9VZtf.jpg","credit_id":"5bcb70320e0a2627ad001d44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2156695,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"PennFuture","original_name":"PennFuture","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bcc908a0e0a26016e00aacb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9150132","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7KszdQ5oWyYCVQv4PiIB9hk7mUZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":904,"name":"pennsylvania, usa"},{"id":33480,"name":"environmental"},{"id":206866,"name":"polluted air"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Clairton Coke Works, Clean Up Our Air (OFFICIAL TRAILER)","key":"N0DSZ6Q1T1Q","published_at":"2016-12-08T01:00:00.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5bcb7127c3a36823a100279b"}]}}}
