Rescued by a gang of down-and-out patrons of the “End of the Trail” mission, Dawn soon falls for a dapper mission benefactor, Hamilton Jones (Norman Kerry), who is also a high-end burglar. When a member of the mission gang, McGregor, is run over by a car while saving a child, Hamilton robs a home to pay his medical bills. Ratted out by a informant, Hamilton goes on trial, but Dawn and the rest of the gang – including a young Rudolph Valentino in a bit part – stand by his side.","popularity":0.2623,"poster_path":"/dYhNkRYkX9RXO4cHjROvTWsgzBl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Virtuous Sinners","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolph Valentino","original_name":"Rudolph Valentino","popularity":0.3549,"profile_path":"/hz1ts5wreDNjCcnfiIDWIcWpu3y.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5bce119292514105710017c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanda Hawley","original_name":"Wanda Hawley","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":"/hDLCnGfPRTwp6egZxHn7EIRsdaB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dawn Emerson","credit_id":"5bce11b0925141057a001af0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Kerry","original_name":"Norman Kerry","popularity":0.1631,"profile_path":"/luQTt1kDR73AclpZeFeQPzPuhjc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hamilton Jones","credit_id":"5bce11bf925141057a001b09","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Holden","original_name":"Harry Holden","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5bce1412c3a3683d58001ed6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmett J.
