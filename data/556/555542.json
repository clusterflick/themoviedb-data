From his texts, the voice of the poet himself weaves the plot. His characters come to life: El Amargo, which runs from a poem taken from \"El Cante Jond\" to the \"Romancero Gitano\". The Woman, blurred and present in so many of his poems. The Mother, a living synthesis of his play-writing. The balcony is open from the hidden Granada to exciting New York. From the rider of tireless riding to the mysterious baroque of Holy Week. From the first babble of the poet to his violent death. Spain is behind its lyric. Also in many images and tensions of the film. The argument of this one wants to approach the argument of a poet. His life and his work, united irremediably.","popularity":0.1657,"poster_path":"/ApimxN47lhcDULOE4XIiI5mAiGC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1984-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El balcón abierto","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":262444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Flores","original_name":"Antonio Flores","popularity":0.1206,"profile_path":"/kqsxQq5xBVDMYsz8GcjX7KQIHgB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"El amargo","credit_id":"666da1565e7802996e20df49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amparo Muñoz","original_name":"Amparo Muñoz","popularity":0.2769,"profile_path":"/lwH1FIxCwje7Cx5kEh6TCDLYPeV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"la mujer","credit_id":"666da177330f8971ef30a4ac","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaime Camino","original_name":"Jaime Camino","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/mimO9VpjfbSa7cDaD7a4qCzEfGJ.jpg","credit_id":"5dca9dda6c0e4f00183e004b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0472712","wikidata_id":"Q35957309","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.743,"height":2693,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ApimxN47lhcDULOE4XIiI5mAiGC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
