Or so says Annabelle, the hottest, the sexiest, and by far the craziest psycho blonde chick to hit Japan since WWII. Deeply embittered about the whole man's-inhumanity-to-man thing, she enacts a diabolical plot to unleash a swarm of mutant insects on the world that will destroy all living creatures except creepy crawlers.  Ensnared in all this madness is a philandering island-hopping bug collector and his compliant and slightly pregnant wife, a humorless doctor from the mainland, and a United States airman named Charlie, whose way of starting a conversation is to hysterically scream \"Genocide!\" and then go off his rocker like the dedicated military professional he is.  If you want to watch a story where everybody gets their nuclear holocaust on in the grand tradition of radioactive Japanese monster movies, this is the film for you!","popularity":1.1885,"poster_path":"/girLLDGT1FJYKRFviLK7tO7toUM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinematic Titanic: War of the Insects","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trace Beaulieu","original_name":"Trace Beaulieu","popularity":0.3297,"profile_path":"/2AB4g7ZSEU3Q5C5Bt6xthvOYK87.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65b2ec293ff2df016340707a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Conniff","original_name":"Frank Conniff","popularity":0.1416,"profile_path":"/dWiyYrczRjH78n6ppe9YiSU1u52.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65b2ec2fa199a601639d8b97","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30024,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Joel Hodgson","original_name":"Joel Hodgson","popularity":0.3018,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65b2ec36a199a601499d8705","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Jo Pehl","original_name":"Mary Jo Pehl","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":"/huWFK2lnHxDcocuk0uMpMrkwOcO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65b2ec3e873f0000c8f53483","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
