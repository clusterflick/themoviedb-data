Pulp-serial snippets, industrial-film imagery, and B- (and Z-) fiction clips are intercut with newly shot live-action material, powering a playful, allegorical trajectory through the now-mythic occult matrix of Jack Parsons (Crowleyite founder of the Jet Propulsion Lab), L.Ron Hubbard (sci-fi author turned cult-leader), and Marjorie Cameron (bohemian artist and \"mother of the New Age movement\"). Their intertwined tales spin out into a speculative farce on the militarization of space, and the corporate take-over of spiritual fulfillment and leisure-time.","popularity":0.1392,"poster_path":"/rTFl8fuWNbZDQiDaAmyj5lW9GVZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mock Up on Mu","video":false,"vote_average":5.778,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damon Packard","original_name":"Damon Packard","popularity":0.0987,"profile_path":"/8Vr7QerVBynwccFUPaA9sc54SQm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"L.
