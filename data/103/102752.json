Since then, the bankers on Wall Street have been fighting by with all available means to avoid going to court. This film is the story of that trial. A film about a trial that may never be held but in which the facts, the participants and their testimonies are all real: the judge, lawyers, witnesses, even the members of the jury - asked to give their verdict - play their own roles. Step by step, one witness after another, the film takes apart, from a plain, human perspective, the mechanisms of subprime mortgage loans, a system that sent the world economy reeling. A trial for the sake of example, a universal fable about capitalism","popularity":0.445,"poster_path":"/3kjLzbIpAHMjWmRmz56hZ15LSam.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12389,"logo_path":"/6yilbEvoHtPcTb4LwAueAq091iT.png","name":"Les Films Pelléas","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":160356,"logo_path":null,"name":"SAGA Production","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2010-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cleveland Versus Wall Street","video":false,"vote_average":7.364,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Cleveland contra Wall Street","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Cleveland contre Wall Street","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1173762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Anderson","original_name":"Barbara Anderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Elle-même","credit_id":"52fe4a10c3a36847f81b6be9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1173763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Taylor","original_name":"Keith Taylor","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Lui-même","credit_id":"52fe4a10c3a36847f81b6bed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1173764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Osinski","original_name":"Michael Osinski","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Lui-même","credit_id":"52fe4a10c3a36847f81b6bf1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1173765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Brancatelli","original_name":"Tony Brancatelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Lui-même","credit_id":"52fe4a10c3a36847f81b6bf5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1173767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Kushen","original_name":"Frederick Kushen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Lui-même","credit_id":"52fe4a10c3a36847f81b6bfd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1173768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurtis Kushen","original_name":"Kurtis Kushen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Lui-même","credit_id":"52fe4a10c3a36847f81b6c01","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1173769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Velez","original_name":"Raymond Velez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Lui-même","credit_id":"52fe4a10c3a36847f81b6c05","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1031960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Stéphane Bron","original_name":"Jean-Stéphane Bron","popularity":0.1238,"profile_path":"/pdtcwd1RP5b9ghLH0bto84QC0tI.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a10c3a36847f81b6be5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1646963","wikidata_id":"Q2978999","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yh6oaGoYlktR51FXsyIYP4brec2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9yeeSp2KF7cgw7Jy8V0LLatjrnJ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3kjLzbIpAHMjWmRmz56hZ15LSam.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":592,"name":"capitalism"},{"id":2357,"name":"cleveland"},{"id":6126,"name":"banking"},{"id":5636,"name":"wall street"},{"id":7335,"name":"lawsuit"},{"id":11038,"name":"trial"},{"id":14737,"name":"economics"},{"id":165193,"name":"financial crisis"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":307587,"name":"crime documentary"},{"id":321490,"name":"historical documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
