While Nic's parents remain trapped in a precarious mutual dependency despite repeated attempts at reconciliation, their 12-year-old son tries to come to terms with his father's traumatizing violent outbursts in games with other children. He tries to teach Marie, who is of his age and suffers from her own relationship with her father, to feel nothing. In fact, both of them are transformed by their experience of the joys and pains of first love.","popularity":0.6476,"poster_path":"/AmAOvzQsaTKQQKlmsC1oZvNfJrA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10259,"logo_path":null,"name":"Look
