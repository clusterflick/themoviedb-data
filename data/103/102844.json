Fittingly returning the image to their lives, director Eric Baudelaire places Adachi and May’s revelatory voiceover reminiscences against warm, fragile Super-8mm footage of their split milieus, Tokyo and Beirut. Grounding their wide-ranging reflections in a solid yet complex reality, Anabasis provides a richly rewarding look at a fascinating, now nearly forgotten era (in politics and cinema), reminding us of film’s own ability to portray—and influence—its landscape.","popularity":0.2244,"poster_path":"/wrDV7fq29enKZLBlf7LjKBFdywl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao Adachi, and 27 Years Without Images","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1207964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mei Shigenobu","original_name":"Mei Shigenobu","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"610521f9ee43e8007f34172e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134812,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Masao Adachi","original_name":"足立正生","popularity":0.3258,"profile_path":"/zKVZDV6EJhAVeYoAXIbnAsjAPMc.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6105221317c443005d4f3d65","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Baudelaire","original_name":"Eric Baudelaire","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/w1VxVJbFm7fBT5ib9Z27zfDOM3E.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a11c3a36847f81b7333","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Baudelaire","original_name":"Eric Baudelaire","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/w1VxVJbFm7fBT5ib9Z27zfDOM3E.jpg","credit_id":"5cdfa6e39251414d21b8942e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Baudelaire","original_name":"Eric Baudelaire","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/w1VxVJbFm7fBT5ib9Z27zfDOM3E.jpg","credit_id":"5cdfa68dc3a36846901eb67a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2299727,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Laure Vermeersch","original_name":"Laure Vermeersch","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cdfa680c3a36846901eb674","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Baudelaire","original_name":"Eric Baudelaire","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/w1VxVJbFm7fBT5ib9Z27zfDOM3E.jpg","credit_id":"5cdfa6ee0e0a264718ca123e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422250,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philippe Welsh","original_name":"Philippe Welsh","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dadc83cfea6e30013adfd28","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2006160","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":842,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wrDV7fq29enKZLBlf7LjKBFdywl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":595},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1499,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l9aBoDntRXF0sT9nUqbAtB0Hwf9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1124}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
