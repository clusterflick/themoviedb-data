One day a man has to go. Away from family, away from home and hearth. Away from the drudgery of his work, out to look the world straight in the eye! In short: one day a man has to go to a equipped holiday cottage. Diederik van Vleuten asked his friend Erik van Muiswinkel to come along. The result was their theatre third program in which two men, one with a house and one with a bunk bed, clash. What are two Dutch friends in their forties discussing in a house on a Dutch Frisian Island?","popularity":0.1789,"poster_path":"/wZex2Li5cXDnIFrFVBt8JIKJyqX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156102,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harry Kies
