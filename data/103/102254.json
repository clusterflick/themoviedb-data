Vowing to oppose, among other faults, the WTO's power to arbitrally overrule nations' environmental, social and labour policies in favour of unbridled corporate greed, protestors from all around came out in force to make their views known and stop the summit. Against them is a brutal police force and a hostile media as well as the stain of a minority of destructively overzealous comrades. Against all odds, the protesters bravely faced fierce opposition to take back the rightful democratic power that the political and corporate elite of the world is determined to deny the little people.","popularity":1.6519,"poster_path":"/vZObUb01Xr7n0Kso4acxbdv5oMl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
