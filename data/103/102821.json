He buys a Peugeot station wagon - license plate GFP831E, and the family sets off for annual holidays exploring every corner of Europe - \"adopting local customs but never forgetting who won the war.\" The narrator is one of the children who, as he ages, sees things he missed as a lad - the car no rocket, dad no speedster. As the years wear on, and the car sits in the driveway, dad keeps it ready for the next great summer holiday.","popularity":0.4352,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home Road Movies","video":false,"vote_average":6.25,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Pappas bil","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Paterson","original_name":"Bill Paterson","popularity":0.5722,"profile_path":"/mk5vpYLmER7asqOhEwVKXD3P3YE.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Father","credit_id":"604919a3c4ad590044ea8e3e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phelim McDermott","original_name":"Phelim McDermott","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/9jxA0ZUS0HvaTKkrNrSpU3UxITE.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"604919b80102c900774f66b0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1032037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Bradbrook","original_name":"Robert Bradbrook","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a11c3a36847f81b7101","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Sellar","original_name":"Ian Sellar","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a11c3a36847f81b7107","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0308376","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
