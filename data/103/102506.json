At turns exhilarating and frustrating, the night will take them from a dive bar to a house party to the streets of Highland Park. Throughout the evening, earnest Luke does his best to defend his big night from a who’s who of interlopers as he tries to decipher what he views as the many mixed signals from gregarious Brie. As the pair’s developing relationship inches from flirtation towards something more substantive, the evening’s myriad distractions will melt away leaving only snowballing misunderstandings mixed with electric moments of connection, each with the potential to be either the igniting spark or the crushing end of their young relationship.","popularity":0.2862,"poster_path":"/iPvMwdptHV42h2JXn7aI27hXla1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108693,"logo_path":null,"name":"600 West Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It seems to be going well.","title":"Luke and Brie Are on a First Date","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Luke y Brie están en su primera cita","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Ducker","original_name":"George Ducker","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Luke","credit_id":"52fe4a09c3a36847f81b5085","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meghan Webster","original_name":"Meghan Webster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Brie","credit_id":"52fe4a09c3a36847f81b5089","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Muldoon","original_name":"Michael Muldoon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1011,"character":"Scott","credit_id":"530aa6c7c3a3684208004a57","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Richardson","original_name":"Chad Richardson","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1012,"character":"Josh","credit_id":"530aa6d6c3a36848f300031a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1031144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chad Hartigan","original_name":"Chad Hartigan","popularity":0.2244,"profile_path":"/jtz6ubgm1SSpowCoCyj9bLrDoti.jpg","cast_id":1013,"character":"Darrell","credit_id":"530aa6e2c3a3684201004c87","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":983971,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Joshua Locy","original_name":"Joshua Locy","popularity":0.0986,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1014,"character":"Ray","credit_id":"530aa73d925141110800423b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Lang","original_name":"Greg Lang","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1015,"character":"Tomás","credit_id":"530aa757925141111a00406f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":966240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lydia Hyslop","original_name":"Lydia Hyslop","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":"/bBPYz0jB9yiOtOUhneHYOqj6LqE.jpg","cast_id":1016,"character":"Cameron","credit_id":"530aa7639251415e710015f9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":983343,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Keegan DeWitt","original_name":"Keegan DeWitt","popularity":0.2476,"profile_path":"/e9Oc1wuVESqHyf694K5DS69CpW.jpg","cast_id":1017,"character":"Dickie","credit_id":"530aa76d92514111020041a4","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1031144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chad Hartigan","original_name":"Chad Hartigan","popularity":0.2244,"profile_path":"/jtz6ubgm1SSpowCoCyj9bLrDoti.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a09c3a36847f81b5081","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056064,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tara Everhart","original_name":"Tara Everhart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530aa615c3a36848f3000308","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306671,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthew I.
