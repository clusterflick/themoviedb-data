With US 2020 elections coming, Kriel gathers a team of whistleblowers and journalists, and journeys across America with his young family, where he discovers a powerful organisation with ties to the heart of the White House. The man who commissioned CA is a member of the most powerful secret political organisation in the United States, with an agenda to rewrite the Constitution according to Christian law.  Going undercover, he risks everything to gain access where no outsider has ever set foot.","popularity":0.1161,"poster_path":"/6QEbD1BNMMRdOFQny6PbCiWbHRj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140952,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metrotone Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Your data was only the beginning.","title":"People You May Know","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2795267,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Kriel","original_name":"Charles Kriel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/qOWHcu1u1mFs6mkQDYWyzGufqd6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f7211623dd1260035674ac9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3940040,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dorsey Carson Jr.","original_name":"Dorsey Carson Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fb79af7646fd008a78376e","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940045,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Arthur Harrison","original_name":"Arthur Harrison","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fb7a4257176f0085449763","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940042,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lindsay Roberts","original_name":"Lindsay Roberts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fb79c596e30b007bd14f22","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2795267,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Kriel","original_name":"Charles Kriel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/qOWHcu1u1mFs6mkQDYWyzGufqd6.jpg","credit_id":"5f72111b1d78f200336eba37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2795266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katharina Gellein Viken","original_name":"Katharina Gellein Viken","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f72110c1967570037914643","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2113534,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jezz Vernon","original_name":"Jezz Vernon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f721138d40d4c00375e5b6e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12606876","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9Dnn5dEWfhlp30snteWjSdAvoS9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4ELfh1i4dul0E9NcLH3ntE1aO56.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.252,"height":615,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6tfv9MzdLwYl8MdAau9oYOaUYSz.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6QEbD1BNMMRdOFQny6PbCiWbHRj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/35YN6akBpc5Rhn0px9MyHmEc8KM.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/cjIvHPI416gW7vJFV9wLLwxLAZv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1067},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s85wIN2WSom3lFF5lsQD4UBKW9R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":15134,"name":"election"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
