Featuring video diaries, we see Billy growing up facing many changes and milestones. With tensions in the family, his mum's health scare, a divorce and an estranged father, we see how those major changes shape Billy as he grows up on camera and tells the story in his own voice. The result is an extraordinary longitudinal documentary about childhood, adolescence, sexuality and family.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/kh1dKEFelg6rfIdyv7JkCTbtv3E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Extraordinary Teens: My Gay Life","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2819987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mel Beer","original_name":"Mel Beer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8c06972667780037eabfee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7906340","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bnYd3EC5X1vTxPids3rURNYmtKs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kh1dKEFelg6rfIdyv7JkCTbtv3E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
