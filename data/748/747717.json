The camera follows Tao, a blooming artist travelling by the means of her skateboard. Along the way they make insightful encounters and live unique experiences, through a variety of colours, landscapes, creative initiatives and incredible mouvements coming to sight progressively within their journey. This summer tale is an individual challenge, taking place through the lives of different encounters bringing out a single poetic line, a movement. Under the humble wheels of a skateboard hides a tribute to the old continent. Overall, questioning the individuality, the mass, and moreover, us, the European youth.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/j2Rch5hLP7T1D6W6LdpuDIcjJar.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121492,"logo_path":"/x30YpIwo0CYNzi2R7PGBSJgqkTg.png","name":"Collectif BKE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As Long As We Go East","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2796459,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lucas Palen","original_name":"Lucas Palen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f733027fea0d70033ff0575","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2796457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mehdi Rondeleux","original_name":"Mehdi Rondeleux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f733006d55e4d003795c785","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8988860","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/goGbPgDtaIa2tO9bQdEEsBA7k9m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j2Rch5hLP7T1D6W6LdpuDIcjJar.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
