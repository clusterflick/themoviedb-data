On making contact with the liquid, the roll opens and of Its own accord frees itself of the gesture that fashioned it. As it comes alive in this way, the sliver of paper reveals Its hitherto unexposed content; this unpredictable kinematics is evidence of the constant impermanence of news. As well as exploring a certain archaeology of cinema, the mechanism references the passage of time: the ink, whether it is poured or printed, is the ink of ongoing human history.\" –Ismaïl Bahri","popularity":0.0438,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film","video":false,"vote_average":7.222,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1677207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ismaïl Bahri","original_name":"Ismaïl Bahri","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/cJcWDXgtIONLfVRsI40b3Qayq5S.jpg","credit_id":"5f71f9a2e4b5760039ef3bf5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
