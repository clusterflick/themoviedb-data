And yet his fabulating and playful inner child drives him restlessly on to fathom ever new realities. Although his works are scattered across the continents, every one of them originated from his childhood in the mountains. They reflect his longing for wonders and real adventures. Director Pascal Hofmann takes us on a mesmerising journey through space and time into the fascinating thought processes and creative works of this headstrong spirit.","popularity":0.1297,"poster_path":"/mXbWhT45icEWdABHd1nXw9UI0Nn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62646,"logo_path":null,"name":"RECK Filmproduktion ZÃ¼rich","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2020-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Raeto-Romance","iso_639_1":"rm","name":""},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not Me: A Journey with Not Vital","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2797075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Not Vital","original_name":"Not Vital","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f73a9ce3ff2df00384ec378","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2797076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annatina Miescher","original_name":"Annatina Miescher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f73a9dd156cc7003645c7ed","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1657291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal Hofmann","original_name":"Pascal Hofmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6f8d2be6271900381b40e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1507445,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maurizius Staerkle Drux","original_name":"Maurizius Staerkle Drux","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f73aa0635039800369bffb7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1533998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benny Jaberg","original_name":"Benny Jaberg","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f73a9fbd38b580036e6904e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1657291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal Hofmann","original_name":"Pascal Hofmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f73a9ea3ff2df003a4ec712","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10619482","wikidata_id":"Q104549274","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zbUU7TmG106CvwNvGm34JJvQVt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zIzc3fCwk1OWRKQ5c17XrSbloK6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1THTgtt36XRnZV0hyT7qANRIbF1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/icN6cNUD4ekdXyuoXdjwHW6QLMi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"mn","file_path":"/mXbWhT45icEWdABHd1nXw9UI0Nn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/7dbgnyHWF7sZCewWfW7kOy1u2D0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kino","release_date":"2021-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Zurich Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
