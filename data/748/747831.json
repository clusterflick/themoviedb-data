Wondering if she can make peace with her absent father if she can find a connection to him through his art, she explores the artistic legacy and life of a man she never knew.","popularity":0.249,"poster_path":"/yCdqnF6n6PgCkOmkxZkZXzLN0Io.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Virgil Films and
