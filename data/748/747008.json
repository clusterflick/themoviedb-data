The Vanja earthquake starts from the Chekhovian masterpiece to investigate Italian post-earthquake immobility through the tragicomic gaze of Chekhov, making the public aware of the extraordinary human strength of the writer. A journey into the Italian theatrical creation; a journey in the earthquake that destroyed central Italy; a journey into the words and soul of Anton Chekhov.","popularity":0.4761,"poster_path":"/x5Pcss3fUIK8afoCE1ZHrOEDUcb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140813,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anton Produzioni","origin_country":""},{"id":140814,"logo_path":null,"name":"Except House Production","origin_country":""},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Vanja Earthquake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Il terremoto di Vanja - Looking for Cechov","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Konchalovsky","original_name":"Андрей Кончаловский","popularity":0.608,"profile_path":"/wPQmCJ6tirAkfPMg7vNAQUeK0yw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8894e8a275020038cbeddb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Servillo","original_name":"Toni Servillo","popularity":0.3054,"profile_path":"/h9Js3JQOFD5h4uNtJB2VwSgMcYq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Anton Chejov (voice)","credit_id":"5f8894f03af92900394be48c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinicio Marchioni","original_name":"Vinicio Marchioni","popularity":0.255,"profile_path":"/phasNXLAL4fylSgts1dNdeXUkuZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8894f739549a0038b539a6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Montanari","original_name":"Francesco Montanari","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/aMNmw6Du3rgTGbmXJS4P8W9vssc.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5f88950039549a0037b4ac34","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriele Salvatores","original_name":"Gabriele Salvatores","popularity":0.1906,"profile_path":"/32fqFsz93L77NiwXKBpfedQBUVA.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5f889508f3b49a0035bd0f73","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinicio Marchioni","original_name":"Vinicio Marchioni","popularity":0.255,"profile_path":"/phasNXLAL4fylSgts1dNdeXUkuZ.jpg","credit_id":"5f6f3f38532acb003618f373","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinicio Marchioni","original_name":"Vinicio Marchioni","popularity":0.255,"profile_path":"/phasNXLAL4fylSgts1dNdeXUkuZ.jpg","credit_id":"5f6f3f406f974600355edc98","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337392,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Igor Artibani","original_name":"Igor Artibani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6f3f477314a100359560e0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1051181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milena Mancini","original_name":"Milena Mancini","popularity":0.1498,"profile_path":"/fBB2Ng6c8Gf3pmJy6qQOT8Tyw8A.jpg","credit_id":"5f6f3f508fdda90037f5f4e2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1935417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Domingo Romano","original_name":"Giuseppe Domingo Romano","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6f3f5ae267de0034383470","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11260190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6T4L8eJSB05lwpg5Cqr6NzdkTxA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zhXKrw4tpreJ1cn6JrahZOUC3tt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/rOOqyTpdEPuMQ05h2CVxx8fsCZa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/x5Pcss3fUIK8afoCE1ZHrOEDUcb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
