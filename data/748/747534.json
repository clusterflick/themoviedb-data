Armed only with mobiles phones, this growing army of eco warriors will do whatever it takes to save their futures from the ravages of climate change. From chaining themselves to coal trains, sitting high in the canopy of threatened rainforest or locking onto bulldozers, their non-violent tactics are designed to generate mass action with one finger tap. Against a backdrop of drought, fire and floods; we witness how today’s environmentalists are making a difference and explore connections with the past through the untold stories of previous campaigns. Surprisingly the methods of old still have currency when a groundswell of school students inspired by the actions of 16-year old Greta Thunberg say, ‘change is coming’ and call a national strike demanding action against global warming.","popularity":0.3694,"poster_path":"/bfoo8xoX2mzGEhbjuuddCN52CX4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91733,"logo_path":"/5o1nptgGnmGxdrYnIhntOqCupHm.png","name":"360 Degree Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2020-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Year on the Frontline of Environmental Activism","title":"Wild Things","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2794351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Searle","original_name":"Lisa Searle","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f712d292ea6b9003696cb23","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2794352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Paine","original_name":"Andy Paine","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f712d44e4b5760039ea8b47","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2794354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milou Albrecht","original_name":"Milou Albrecht","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f712d5dfbe36f003863d711","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2794355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harriet O'Shea Carre","original_name":"Harriet O'Shea Carre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f712d7dd38b580037e32197","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349380,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antony Partos","original_name":"Antony Partos","popularity":0.1067,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627ac93b9715ae00504be4f7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1352445,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matteo Zingales","original_name":"Matteo Zingales","popularity":0.064,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627ac955a7e3630e20fbfb16","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1734024,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sally Ingleton","original_name":"Sally Ingleton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f712b6dd38b580038e4cb9d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1734024,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sally Ingleton","original_name":"Sally Ingleton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f712b7e19675700378d79f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2526601,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Gissing","original_name":"Michael Gissing","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f712be793db920039a57c3a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411526,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steven Robinson","original_name":"Steven Robinson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f712b901d78f2003467977e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13517364","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"wildthingsdocumentary","instagram_id":"wildthingsdocumentary","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bfoo8xoX2mzGEhbjuuddCN52CX4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":178027,"name":"environmental destruction"},{"id":222551,"name":"environmental activist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"Cinefest Oz","release_date":"2020-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Wild Things Trailer","key":"458941927","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-17T11:51:56.000Z","id":"5f712c14e4b5760036e80f9c"}]}}}
