Chicago’s Black transgender icon Gloria Allen, now in her 70s, blazed a trail for trans people like few others before her. Emerging from Chicago’s South Side drag ball culture in the 1960s, Gloria overcame traumatic violence to become a proud leader in her community. Most famously, she pioneered a charm school for young transgender people that served as inspiration for Chicago playwright Philip Dawkins’ hit play Charm. Luchina Fisher’s empathic and engaging documentary is not only a portrait of a groundbreaking legend, but also a celebration of unconditional love, the love Gloria received from her own mother and that she now gives to her chosen children.","popularity":0.1269,"poster_path":"/e840HFkmseiMA5Eyzv7VVj1mTqd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mama Gloria","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4215639,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Iliana Hagenah","original_name":"Iliana Hagenah","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64daadb9001bbd00add43023","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3975346,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mike Nuget","original_name":"Mike Nuget","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64daae14f495ee0293563d0f","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1727550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yvonne Welbon","original_name":"Yvonne Welbon","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64daaddc37109700c51c3ade","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4215636,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lorna Grisby","original_name":"Lorna Grisby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64daada7001bbd011d91f9c1","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4215642,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ian Bertorelli","original_name":"Ian Bertorelli","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64daadf2d100b600e26b1d42","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847580,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luchina Fisher","original_name":"Luchina Fisher","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f72641c223e2000397b4ac3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10741012","wikidata_id":"Q109701623","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vdEt8AOQU8lP6ODspAjBkBOsQTI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e840HFkmseiMA5Eyzv7VVj1mTqd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":502},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qirAlFtA5NcMfXVO0HKQD5T83t6.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":529},{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mRTJ8Tqo17aVh7PTdIxzIgOjYVx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":698}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Chicago International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
