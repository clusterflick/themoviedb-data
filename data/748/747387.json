In Subsaharan Africa, one child still dies every 60 seconds. Nobody, including Big Pharma, the Gates Foundation, or the WHO, seems to believe that Africans have their own solutions.  Director Katharina Weingartner takes us to an area that she calls the “ground zero” of malaria: the countries around the Lake Victoria basin in East Africa. In Uganda and Kenya, she found people who have taken action against malaria using local strategies. The Fever portrays the fight against malaria in East Africa as a case study in greed and courage.","popularity":0.0694,"poster_path":"/pdFdc0S8ftQAXVhFlSAFV2RTHsN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140881,"logo_path":null,"name":"pooldoks filmproduktion kg","origin_country":""},{"id":97124,"logo_path":"/yPMc0cRnUqpbXWHavXgLuPXyfHk.png","name":"W-film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fever","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Fever","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2793811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Patrick Ogwang","original_name":"Dr. Patrick Ogwang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f70b5821d78f20036670fb9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2793812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rehema Namyalo","original_name":"Rehema Namyalo","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f70b59993db920037a2f8a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2793813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Richard Mukabana","original_name":"Dr. Richard Mukabana","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f70b5b23dd12600366686e7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2793814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Mwam","original_name":"Paul Mwam","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f70b5c435039800368e0b58","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2604691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katharina Weingartner","original_name":"Katharina Weingartner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f70b46ba6e2d200386bd6e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2604691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katharina Weingartner","original_name":"Katharina Weingartner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f70b47935039800368e0089","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219616,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Siri Klug","original_name":"Siri Klug","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f70b507fbe36f00376dc4b1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890060,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Markus Wailand","original_name":"Markus Wailand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3db093cd12c0041e42a06","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ayub Ogada","original_name":"Ayub Ogada","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3db22cca7de00403f477c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890062,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cinderella Sanyu","original_name":"Cinderella Sanyu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3db33b7b69d003bf32c91","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029259,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Becker","original_name":"Patrick Becker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3db573cd12c003fe42fd5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928517,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Fleming","original_name":"Richard Fleming","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3db679e4586003dba54a5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10445166","wikidata_id":"Q76860368","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1680,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pajfqYynBRjsEo5887KTtDXnkzZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1189},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/pdFdc0S8ftQAXVhFlSAFV2RTHsN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Englisch\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"Englisch\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
