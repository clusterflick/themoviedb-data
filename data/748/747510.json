Barr writes of the work's \"obsessive [nature], both in its unbroken verbal narrative — and also in its singular camera action — that of the zoom.\" His use of a succinct formal device — the continual opening and closing of an elevator door — propels the narrative structure. The elevator door opens to reveal one woman speaking directly to the camera; her narrative is then interrupted by the closing of the door as the camera zooms out. The women's deceptively ordinary vignettes are transformed into eerie, self-contained fictions via Barr's use of fragmentation. By cutting from one woman to the other, Barr merges their individual monologues into a seamless narrative flow.","popularity":0.0443,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Elevator","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2794260,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Nancy Tsuchiya","original_name":"Nancy Tsuchiya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f710feb93db920036a4107e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Burt Barr","original_name":"Burt Barr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f710fa1e4b5760036e7c4c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2794257,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Byrne","original_name":"James Byrne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f710fbe35039800378e645f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Car"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2794260,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Nancy Tsuchiya","original_name":"Nancy Tsuchiya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f710fe11f748b003825fde7","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
