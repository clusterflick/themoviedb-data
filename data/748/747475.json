Awesome! Volume 3 covers 1979 through 1984 and is packed with classics like Monsterpiece Theater and Beatle Bailey. Furry new faces like Telly Monster, the Honkers, and Forgetful Jones move to the street!  That street gets even longer when the whole cast - plus Big Bird and Oscar - travels to Puerto Rico for Maria's birthday! Gordon and Snuffleupagus get \"footloose\" as they lace up their running shoes and complete the New York City Marathon, and Big Bird packs his bags for summer camp. Getting reunited with memories from your childhood feels so good!","popularity":0.2711,"poster_path":"/yR5C9RAqP16fuVt0fN3JsO0QexW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3673,"logo_path":"/nDLYSGvTaIUU7LRFLwSk2xG9KLo.png","name":"Sesame Workshop","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":398,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sesame Street: Old School Vol. 3 (1979-1984)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroll Spinney","original_name":"Caroll Spinney","popularity":0.2904,"profile_path":"/rYn1E9Um326MA1sWCEBlMCFkRGD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Big Bird","credit_id":"5feca82907291c0041e28149","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1103687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Ganz Cooney","original_name":"Joan Ganz Cooney","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/bel0wb59frephWfqmguRnusfYfV.jpg","credit_id":"6150d2270582240022bbbcfc","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217334,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Lloyd Morrisett","original_name":"Lloyd Morrisett","popularity":0.157,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5feca8544ccc50003e7ee931","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Stone","original_name":"Jon Stone","popularity":0.1125,"profile_path":"/jMLg0mT3CjHfWsDm9vH97KhO2xc.jpg","credit_id":"5feca863e004a6003f28392b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Stone","original_name":"Jon Stone","popularity":0.1125,"profile_path":"/jMLg0mT3CjHfWsDm9vH97KhO2xc.jpg","credit_id":"5feca86de04aca003e163730","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rbeFTh8Kx6SCJYhNhvFda3zZzzP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.741,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yvIGZWQTQHCTOax9HCayGwoUVG9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1111},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1666,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1CcsZoqR7M3ejCzGtmnRhNgUKTH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1111},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yR5C9RAqP16fuVt0fN3JsO0QexW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2470,"name":"education"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Opening To Sesame Street Old School:Volume 1 2006 DVD","key":"LxF-SPZ5XMo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-04-21T17:39:23.000Z","id":"5feca90621c4ca003f55a13a"}]}}}
