Anchored by his East African community in Malta and phone calls across continents, he lives suspended between two worlds: the home he misses and the one he’s trying to make.  The hybrid short, which explores how relationships are affected by migration, was filmed in Malta and Kenya by award-winning British Nigerian director Renee Maria Osubu, created alongside charities SPARK 15 and RAAH and produced by Somesuch.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In-Between","title":"In-Between","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39084407","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
