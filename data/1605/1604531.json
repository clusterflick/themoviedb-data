The concept and scenario for Lagos Wide & Close was developed by Van der Haak and Wawro during a masterclass of the Sandberg Institute and Dutch Cultural Media Fund in 2003 and produced by Submarine. The interactive film presents a selection of video and audio of Lagos recorded in 2001. It separates the distant - wide - and the intimate - close - views of the city enabling the viewer to switch between these perspectives interactively. Rather than following a dramatic storyline, it aims to bring the viewer close to the reality of what it means to live and work in Lagos, to move alongside bus driver Olawole Busayo and other Lagosians, and to delve into the city's layered fabric, slowly making sense of the rules, the possibilities, and lifestyles of Lagos.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jj3Q3SZmCs188V0w0uV97tonREq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Yoruba","iso_639_1":"yo","name":"Èdè Yorùbá"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lagos Wide and Close","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bregtje van der Haak","original_name":"Bregtje van der Haak","popularity":0.3023,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ef908c1ce862e0e2fb9a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":40404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Oey","original_name":"Alexander Oey","popularity":0.1351,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ef940d2235581e4fb0e88","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jj3Q3SZmCs188V0w0uV97tonREq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
