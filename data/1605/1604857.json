The Madonna began to bleed. The crowd wanted to punish the boy for his wicked deed. The Count of Sarno decided to have him hanged from a tree. A few hours later, the tree withered. This is the myth that has always accompanied the oldest Marian cult in Campania (Italy).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9OHfx6jt6X7ilptRa034gCqyLSs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2025-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MATRIARCH","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5901101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaetano Mattia Cosentino","original_name":"Gaetano Mattia Cosentino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694fe7576ddc65daf28123bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5901105,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martino Allocca","original_name":"Martino Allocca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694fe78e4e3a808d7bfb1297","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1498,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9OHfx6jt6X7ilptRa034gCqyLSs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4648,"name":"naples, italy"},{"id":178611,"name":"virgin mary"},{"id":192947,"name":"religious film"},{"id":281588,"name":"traditional values"},{"id":302099,"name":"religious fanaticism"},{"id":336960,"name":"napoli"},{"id":355358,"name":"catholic religion"},{"id":358972,"name":"antropology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Capri, Hollywood – International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
