Very soon they run into trouble: it just so happens that Del is a dead ringer for notorious Mafia boss Don Vincenzo Occhetti, and is spotted by his sons in a bar. Occhetti is due to stand trial and destined to go down for several life sentences and, with Del's uncanny resemblance, his sons see a way out for their father. When the Trotters leave the bar, they discover their camper van has been broken into and all their possessions stolen. But this is only the start of their problems: help is soon at hand when Occhetti's sons step in as apparent Good Samaritans.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5NfkBPKPd7SC8aRp5p3nBnGHB42.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only
