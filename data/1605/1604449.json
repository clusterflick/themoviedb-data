But when the young trader takes sole responsibility for a $2.3 billion loss, everything changes. The film challenges the usual narrative of events. It reconstructs the legal proceedings based on the original court records and, in doing so, raises more questions than it answers. “The Narrative” is a film about responsibility in the workings of global capitalism.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12431,"logo_path":"/3m45frhaRCLsCKuMtuj7ZwfGwBB.png","name":"SRG SSR","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2026-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Narrative","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5899569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kweku Adoboli","original_name":"Kweku Adoboli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"self","credit_id":"694ec8905fdb80d8a38eb4e4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Schilt","original_name":"Martin Schilt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ec69189e2aa8f55074a14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2147133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Weber","original_name":"Bernard Weber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ec6a74d76ebf5f2154e86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":72378,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marina Wernli","original_name":"Marina Wernli","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ec7cb4d7877550afb0d3d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2717678,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergio Cassini","original_name":"Sergio Cassini","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ec7d8db02de37f58cdeca","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272093,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ramon Giger","original_name":"Ramon Giger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ec7ea37935bc522154e14","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2094520,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marco Teufen","original_name":"Marco Teufen","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":"/w8YtZds8Orln3ZS6h6hdUIWEqVz.jpg","credit_id":"694ec81bdb0d7128e48ce162","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8097230","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1013,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7vlymtCXVbcJJ5WpWmII5A7IM3A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Journées de Soleure","release_date":"2026-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
