It follows 14-year-old Mathias, who, struggling with trauma, retreats into a childhood memory of learning to ride a bicycle with his mother, Belinda. As she removes his training wheels, she teaches him resilience and hope, reassuring him that falling isn't failure. The film contrasts Mathias's painful present with the warmth of his past, using vibrant animation to show his joy and the symbolic mantis of encouragement. Mantis Boy explores love, resilience, and the lasting impact of memories, highlighting how embracing both light and darkness can heal and empower.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":278658,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dallada Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Mantis Boy","title":"Mantis Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4842159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Bray","original_name":"Ken Bray","popularity":2.1652,"profile_path":"/6F6OswL0QPtOYIUaHHHMA3sRDEZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Coach Warren (voice)","credit_id":"694f091b8b7248534b7abdfa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4627620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alontae Myson Williams","original_name":"Alontae Myson Williams","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"14-year-old Mathias Henderson (voice)","credit_id":"694f094edb0d7128e48ce27a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5583883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micah Tsekiri","original_name":"Micah Tsekiri","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"06-year-old Mathias Henderson (voice)","credit_id":"694f09601cdb3f496f07301b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1908224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teneisha Collins","original_name":"Teneisha Collins","popularity":0.4584,"profile_path":"/9lP1AggH8rWNXAFzJ5N2skCLhum.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Belinda Henderson (voice)","credit_id":"694f09770823ea92698ce0a9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5779254,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marie-Eva Volmar","original_name":"Marie-Eva Volmar","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f0994b762bfc0eb8120a5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5779254,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marie-Eva Volmar","original_name":"Marie-Eva Volmar","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f09a81bcaa8f889073061","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900117,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rafal Golda","original_name":"Rafal Golda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f09e01cdb3f496f07302d","department":"Sound","job":"Music Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900118,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tomasz Bedyniak","original_name":"Tomasz Bedyniak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f09f458238f210c155001","department":"Sound","job":"Music Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33429127","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":364575,"name":"mantis boy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
