This space can be either private or public. But where is the boundary between these two worlds, and does it differ for each of us? The documentary film Bodies We Live In explores this question through the meeting of Johanna and the Prague Roller Derby team, which since 2012 has been the first in the Czech Republic to devote itself to this women’s contact sport on track roller skates. Directed by Mady Berrenger and Lucie Onrubia-Muro, the film was made at the Belgian film school INSAS in collaboration with Prague’s FAMU.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bodies We Live In","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Těla, ve kterých žijeme","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133717,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mado Berrenger","original_name":"Mado Berrenger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f0d049da83e804e7abcf9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4751467,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lucie Muro Onrubia","original_name":"Lucie Muro Onrubia","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f0d21c38c31a2cf7abd3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133717,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mado Berrenger","original_name":"Mado Berrenger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f0d3537935bc522154f41","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133717,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mado Berrenger","original_name":"Mado Berrenger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f0d4a9da83e804e7abd00","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133717,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mado Berrenger","original_name":"Mado Berrenger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f0d620b16c9b9f91551d9","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4751467,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lucie Muro Onrubia","original_name":"Lucie Muro Onrubia","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f0d7f1d7715ba528ce01b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900128,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manon Ledune","original_name":"Manon Ledune","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f0db170cc74ff92072e3a","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4751467,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lucie Muro Onrubia","original_name":"Lucie Muro Onrubia","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f0dc71869be1085074c5c","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900130,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Félicie Bied-Charreton","original_name":"Félicie Bied-Charreton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f0dd7c07abdfe79157101","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
