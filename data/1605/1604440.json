Alberto, a firefighter marked by a dramatic past, enters a deserted bar during the news broadcast reporting on the destruction and victims of the earthquake in Abruzzo, which occurred three days earlier. Tormented by the memory of a tragic event, he recognizes an old trophy as a symbol of his pain. Arriving in the earthquake zone, Alberto and his colleagues dig through the rubble, aided by a sniffer dog led by Enrico. When the animal signals something unusual, Alberto decides to intervene. That descent into the ruins becomes a challenge that will force him to confront the shadow of a memory that has never truly been buried.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/602JNh93ZC3YxTCCtGWL9NUKiq9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121325,"logo_path":"/a25PvxuxN6mGwaRTy8tusucyfTn.png","name":"Inthelfilm","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2025-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Re Minore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1501829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Rocco","original_name":"Antonio Rocco","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"694ec3d98729e29ab32fbbe1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2069042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Pio Romano","original_name":"Francesco Pio Romano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"694ec3f042b428abdf2fbccc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1722956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Romeo","original_name":"Marco Romeo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"694ec3f6219c77e555fb0d05","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3974042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Maria Castaldo","original_name":"Antonio Maria Castaldo","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ec35edfb34c48197abd29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5899535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianluca Grazini","original_name":"Gianluca Grazini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ec36b68435f9fa68eb316","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5899535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianluca Grazini","original_name":"Gianluca Grazini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ec3794935b2e332fb27a7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2863189,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marco Signoretti","original_name":"Marco Signoretti","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ec388b1a0c99a68b1c532","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1511506,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giuseppe Pignone","original_name":"Giuseppe Pignone","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ec3990823ea92698cdf3d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2863189,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marco Signoretti","original_name":"Marco Signoretti","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ec3a633a8536e668eb3d1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5899538,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"M_Side","original_name":"M_Side","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ec3b6b0e2908aec8ed175","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5058682,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tommaso di Lorenzo","original_name":"Tommaso di Lorenzo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ec3c625898baa998cdf16","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/602JNh93ZC3YxTCCtGWL9NUKiq9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Capri, Hollywood – International Film Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
