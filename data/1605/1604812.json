A practical experience of incorporation of Amerindian perspectivism in the cinema-system. The experience of situating this system – from the Super 8 film (thrown and recovered from the sea) and its devices (screen, projectors) - in a sympoiesis (doing with) with the living system, with the water, the sea, the “environment”. A simple attempt to demolish the false split nature/culture, a suggestion of anthropophagic cinema, “anthropophagy: swallowing the environment” (H. Oiticica).","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3brC3XwTltrQYiYgZV01Lhtj1PH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"“Earth” (that is any something) has no escape from heaven (that is nothing)”","title":"Revém Natura","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110873,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ж","original_name":"Ж","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694fd46f7fc27ff3478ce721","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1537,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3brC3XwTltrQYiYgZV01Lhtj1PH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
