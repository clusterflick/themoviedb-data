Each frame of the film was taken at night via a long time-lapse (\"time-exposure\") which created the actual images, and each frame of film was taken after a period of time from the previous frame, creating the movement of the images. What looks like the sun in some shots is actually the moon, over-exposed to allow the capture of the much-dimmer stars in the sky. Longer exposures for each frame can make a night-time shot look like a day-time shot, except that you can still see stars moving in the sky. This film won a CINE Golden Eagle.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/87Q5LuNnYPHlh0x9NFBD6tfUJ5q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Loyola Marymount University School of Film and Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"1987 Student Academy Award - Experimental","title":"Zebu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3304157,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pat Rettig","original_name":"Pat Rettig","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694fce929a70cadda78125b2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900965,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"J.J.
