It only includes music and percussion by Nana Vasconcelos and Ralph Towner, as well as singing and lute music by a blind woman. The counterpoint and interweaving of these passages in time seem to communicate the transmigration of life and the flow of time. Birth and death move in a cycle like the eternal earth, and people can only constantly walk along the road.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kGjMTvTafZj3LMFnorZhwYCnE1v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Chao-Tang","original_name":"張照堂","popularity":0.3566,"profile_path":"/43U7LH5tnW9KQvgWYwDMC7gQ0SD.jpg","credit_id":"694da763f159144b35fb245b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Chao-Tang","original_name":"張照堂","popularity":0.3566,"profile_path":"/43U7LH5tnW9KQvgWYwDMC7gQ0SD.jpg","credit_id":"694da76a9bed82c89afb08a4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153076,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Naná Vasconcelos","original_name":"Naná Vasconcelos","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/gmuF6CvawUFeUBZCESfkC1qQBdx.jpg","credit_id":"694da7764935b2e332fb2425","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Towner","original_name":"Ralph Towner","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694da781f159144b35fb245f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/paPOn6zQTPIdieG3FsCVyiL6cNz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kGjMTvTafZj3LMFnorZhwYCnE1v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
