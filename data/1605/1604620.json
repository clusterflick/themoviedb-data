The documentary humanizes the face of SMI with a small cast of memorable characters, followed in real time over several years, as they — and also their families — navigate a system that too often seems to conspire against them. The historic roots of this national crisis are traced, as well as the emergence of bold but controversial activism that seeks to reinvent those failed policies. Inspired by the book of the same name by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and New York Times bestselling author Ron Powers. With narration by actor Bob Odenkirk and original music by Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":284400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crazy People Productions LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No One Cares About Crazy People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Odenkirk","original_name":"Bob Odenkirk","popularity":3.5502,"profile_path":"/rF0Lb6SBhGSTvjRffmlKRSeI3jE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"694f3dc06b8e041672072f30","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Rippee","original_name":"Mark Rippee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"694f3ed0b6e9ddb98efb0f7f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Powers","original_name":"Ron Powers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"694f3f19c8dc71e8e1812104","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Powers","original_name":"Kevin Powers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"694f42ad58238f210c1550cf","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gail Freedman","original_name":"Gail Freedman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f3e72728568dbaa8139d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1824824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gail Freedman","original_name":"Gail Freedman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f3fc9abe94c3bba7abb98","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211227,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dina Potocki","original_name":"Dina Potocki","popularity":1.2461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f3ff16ee2af9659155194","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":535284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroleen Feeney","original_name":"Caroleen Feeney","popularity":0.315,"profile_path":"/dYzhTQAoKQiO08oVzJ1rlL9IxHW.jpg","credit_id":"694f4022936ff5a8ccb1c62a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1471722,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Pruitt-Bruun","original_name":"Michael Pruitt-Bruun","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f40348bdfaabf071550fc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900388,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Clare Major","original_name":"Clare Major","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f4086396107a0dd7abc39","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2562598,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gabe C.
