Shot in a single night with an old handheld camcorder, 'streetlights' is the re-creation of a filmmaker's own futile night walk several years prior. While carrying buried emotions of the past and contemplations of the present, the filmmaker documents her journey and allows the filmmaking process to be informed by the emotions that surface. With no script or plan, the film's narrative is shaped entirely by the inner world. What results is an experiment in making a film by finding it.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"the streetlights flicker when i blink","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5810426,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Weiqi Chuah","original_name":"Weiqi Chuah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f2e80219c77e555fb0eef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
