Born in 1920 in Nankunshen, Tainan, orphaned at a young age, Hung Tung worked as a laborer, fisherman, and spiritual medium before suddenly beginning to paint at fifty. His densely imagined world—filled with plants, humans, animals, gods, ghosts, and symbols—captivated the Taiwanese art scene of the 1970s and secured his reputation as a legendary folk artist.  Combining observational footage, interviews, and a distinctive musical structure—from Tibor Szemző’s evocation of innocence to Leonard Cohen’s “Bird on the Wire”—the film traces a life of solitude, frustration, and pride, shaping a restrained yet poignant portrait of an artist who remained fiercely autonomous within his own inner universe.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6UoZtvbRzv5kS75FKydJlP4i2zM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homage to Hung-Tung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Chao-Tang","original_name":"張照堂","popularity":0.3566,"profile_path":"/43U7LH5tnW9KQvgWYwDMC7gQ0SD.jpg","credit_id":"694da2364d76ebf5f2154a35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Chao-Tang","original_name":"張照堂","popularity":0.3566,"profile_path":"/43U7LH5tnW9KQvgWYwDMC7gQ0SD.jpg","credit_id":"694da24276536d42e8b1c106","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3185,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Cohen","original_name":"Leonard Cohen","popularity":0.2257,"profile_path":"/cRHWtGOa7IOJWayAQM3FBLCM82x.jpg","credit_id":"694da25923243afa15fb0b1d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1478855,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tibor Szemzö","original_name":"Tibor Szemzö","popularity":0.4244,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694da282c38c31a2cf7ab742","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6UoZtvbRzv5kS75FKydJlP4i2zM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
