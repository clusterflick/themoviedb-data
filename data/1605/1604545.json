The film is the final part of the \"Urban Wasteland Serial\", Kaganof's trilogy about egocentric men, who are basically very lonely. This feature is about a black man who kills his white girlfriend. During profound debates with the female prosecutor and his girlfriend, it gradually becomes apparent that he really wanted to kill his mother. \"The Turner Revelation\" is a complex style experiment about race, education, prejudice and fierce sexual urges in which Kaganof uses a violently moving camera and extreme close-ups to visualise the desolate inner landscape of the protagonists.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/b33cQLkIgmEa4B2yMurUzXzOnqK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Turner Revelation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gylan Kain","original_name":"Gylan Kain","popularity":0.0514,"profile_path":"/1xTphNee7IwnaxzyfThMJ5vpyGS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"694f01da37935bc522154eb7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2522754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacey Grace","original_name":"Stacey Grace","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"694f01e504eefa2d668eb3bd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aryan Kaganof","original_name":"Aryan Kaganof","popularity":0.0893,"profile_path":"/rUElkeHdGyUXje2Sl0ubwWNRKOj.jpg","credit_id":"694f0203db02de37f58cdfdb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900053,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"The Channels","original_name":"The Channels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f021f25b7767cee8eb5d9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190875,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joost van Gelder","original_name":"Joost van Gelder","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f02559a70cadda78121b9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aryan Kaganof","original_name":"Aryan Kaganof","popularity":0.0893,"profile_path":"/rUElkeHdGyUXje2Sl0ubwWNRKOj.jpg","credit_id":"694f02668bdfaabf07154fe4","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gylan Kain","original_name":"Gylan Kain","popularity":0.0514,"profile_path":"/1xTphNee7IwnaxzyfThMJ5vpyGS.jpg","credit_id":"694f027d95089ddb5e7abc6a","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1544822,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fokke van Saane","original_name":"Fokke van Saane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f02a3db02de37f58cdfea","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b33cQLkIgmEa4B2yMurUzXzOnqK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
