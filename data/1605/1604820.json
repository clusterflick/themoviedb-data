A year later, he still struggles to fit in with his colleagues, particularly with Seiji Ogami (Daisuke Nakagawa), the ace of the sales department, whom he both admires and is envious of. On a night of a full moon, Akihito stumbles across a shrine, where he finds an old mirror with a mysterious message that the person who looks into the mirror will see their true self. After Akihito wishes to stand on equal footing with Seiji, he's suddenly surrounded by mist, and he awakens in a world that looks just like his – but his colleagues treat him warmly, and Seiji looks at him with affection. Can Akihito use this opportunity to confront his true feelings about Seiji and learn how to let others in?
