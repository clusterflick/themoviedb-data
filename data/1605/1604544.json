Formed in 2003 by the rhythm section of Sleep, the group features Al Cisneros, Emil Amos, and Tyler Trotter. Together, they draw from a host of other influences—including psychedelic rock, Middle Eastern folk, dub, reggae, and post-rock—and incorporate musical structures similar to Tibetan, Byzantine, and Ethiopian chanting. Their very name derives from the Hindu concept of Om, referring to the natural vibration of the universe.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Om Live at Pioneer Works","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1226,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jg1NhzKy3OucguD2rJQeVluBTvp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2182},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":935,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kJUI7LSHCejXpnoTdjKjjHStumt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1665}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
