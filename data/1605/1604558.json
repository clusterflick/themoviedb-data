At points the model appears to be struck by the absurdity of the situation, and looks like she might have been tempted to laugh.  Perhaps the work of an amateur film-maker, this film entered the BFI National Archive as part of a large donation predominantly comprised of late 1950s 16mm glamour films produced for the home movie market. One of the most enigmatic items in the deposit, nothing is known of who made it, or exactly for what purpose.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Off the Shoulder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
