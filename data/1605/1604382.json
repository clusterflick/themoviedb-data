Born in Beijing and later relocated to Taiwan, Chang lived with acromegaly, reaching a height far beyond ordinary human scale. Once exhibited, later enlisted, and eventually turned into a public figure through sport and media, his life traces how an anomalous body is disciplined, displayed, and normalized by social institutions. Filmed with restraint rather than sensationalism, the work observes Chang’s daily gestures and silences, allowing his presence to expose the fragile boundary between individuality and social gaze.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/gNTgC8uyPBmoomRIg0Xlje0E1aH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"張英武素描","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"張英武的故事","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"巨人張英武","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"張英武","original_name":"張英武","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"694fbfd576536d42e8b1c90f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Chao-Tang","original_name":"張照堂","popularity":0.4571,"profile_path":"/43U7LH5tnW9KQvgWYwDMC7gQ0SD.jpg","credit_id":"694e9ff0b0e2908aec8ed0f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Chao-Tang","original_name":"張照堂","popularity":0.4571,"profile_path":"/43U7LH5tnW9KQvgWYwDMC7gQ0SD.jpg","credit_id":"694e9ff670e833a7a3fb0ea1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5752632,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"潘健行","original_name":"潘健行","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694ea0067fc27ff3478ce060","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gNTgC8uyPBmoomRIg0Xlje0E1aH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
