One day, she hides in the woods to secretly observe the hunt. As she watches the dying animals, she grows attached to these beautiful, innocent creatures and continues to care for them even after death. Alix returns home with dirty hands—and with a powerful realization of the value of life. Who is the real monster in this world? Those in the village, or those in the forest? Between the Beasts is the graduation film of director Luchina Paparella, made at the Belgian film school INSAS.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entre les betes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Néo Minten","original_name":"Néo Minten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"694f154014edd4da288eb8a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriele Simonini","original_name":"Gabriele Simonini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"694f154aa0779e2556b1c746","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Marie Loop","original_name":"Anne-Marie Loop","popularity":0.5099,"profile_path":"/igYOgcbWoe8g7WoNG4RaaS68nFO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"694f155314edd4da288eb8a5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didier De Neck","original_name":"Didier De Neck","popularity":1.3594,"profile_path":"/j0SlbMNz4shEZCRnWyrOCfZ2Zmv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"694f156025b7767cee8eb625","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonia Pastecchia","original_name":"Sonia Pastecchia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4IiWBIVebH71TGLVnLL6TVubQnF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"694f1569d9b2b5a1fa8cdf46","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Seine","original_name":"Emma Seine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"694f157214edd4da288eb8b0","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luchino Paparella","original_name":"Luchino Paparella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f158514edd4da288eb8bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900181,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gaspard Renier","original_name":"Gaspard Renier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f1592abe94c3bba7abb05","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900182,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marius Benguigui-Hersan","original_name":"Marius Benguigui-Hersan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f159eda04f43c218cdedc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900128,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manon Ledune","original_name":"Manon Ledune","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f15ae62d4bc6269812138","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2410033,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vincent Canart","original_name":"Vincent Canart","popularity":0.1553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f15bc396107a0dd7abb81","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900184,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mildred Aubourg","original_name":"Mildred Aubourg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f15d4936ff5a8ccb1c592","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900185,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Camille Coutouly","original_name":"Camille Coutouly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694f15e187411f96277abbc6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
