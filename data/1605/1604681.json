The film follows Mr. Muller's life and careers (in both music and the intelligence services) from youth to the present, with many insightful interviews with family, friends, and colleagues, and with much attention given to his 'Antillean Dances' for piano. These Antillean Dances are delightful piano works that evoke the spirit of the composer's native Curaçao, and they instantly charm any listener who has at least a shred of human feeling.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nostalgia: The Music of Wim Statius Muller","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1821553","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
