Thomas, one of thousands of children stolen by the Nazis from Eastern Europe during WWII, is under the care of Ruth, a UN relief worker. Should she try to find his parents or leave him with those he’s grown up with? The choice she makes will shape his life.  London, 1990. Years later, Thomas visits Ruth. As they untangle the past, the decisions Ruth made as a very young woman are called powerfully into question.  Juliet Stevenson is Ruth in this remarkable and timely new play by David Lan, former Artistic Director of the Young Vic. Immersed in the shapeshifting nature of memory and morality, it’s directed by Stephen Daldry (The Jungle, The Inheritance).","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1f3lZxiWHx8FExNWUaLzJRgvIp7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":149,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Theatre at Home: The Land of the Living","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atilla Akinci","original_name":"Atilla Akinci","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mayor","credit_id":"694ddc85b1a0c99a68b1c142","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1231952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Duchêne","original_name":"Kate Duchêne","popularity":0.2897,"profile_path":"/3aDgYj5FqqVSUKKq7PtnkMjow6z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dora","credit_id":"694ddce014edd4da288eb319","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5898479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Fox","original_name":"Michael Fox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"George","credit_id":"694ddd3076536d42e8b1c1dc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3452554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert Hanowicz","original_name":"Hubert Hanowicz","popularity":0.1234,"profile_path":"/a9al2lD7tn2s4sdQl5x3Swc13Ym.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pawel","credit_id":"694ddd420df1ab1c9a2fb6b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1229186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Loncq","original_name":"Caroline Loncq","popularity":1.076,"profile_path":"/4wAnrUiJLTZEsJsJJmk8qYJxbmo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Elise","credit_id":"694ddd5a62d4bc6269811b5a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2442125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avital Lvova","original_name":"Avital Lvova","popularity":0.3429,"profile_path":"/8WF3Tn6vokM3kWWA46lVSW2qZgk.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Olga","credit_id":"694ddd6e5508b7d2ca2fb804","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Marcus","original_name":"Michael Marcus","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/sKIPOyGQUvD9CcFldpiy7poDnNq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bill","credit_id":"694ddd9086c6d003b67ad5ff","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2458118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anastasia Martin","original_name":"Anastasia Martin","popularity":0.5294,"profile_path":"/wCq7yNDlBZNcxXmHJ3kWhleTlKB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Theresa","credit_id":"694dddb351d9a2755a81396d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1533995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marek Oravec","original_name":"Marek Oravec","popularity":0.3528,"profile_path":"/uU57nyt3286yOv0B5albHz66T2r.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Thomas' Father","credit_id":"694dddcbc47bd929a38cdd2d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cosima Shaw","original_name":"Cosima Shaw","popularity":0.402,"profile_path":"/nfOwflFM8WiNj5xKZidA8WRG1TE.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Thomas' Mother","credit_id":"694ddddb97fe056efe2fb72f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliet Stevenson","original_name":"Juliet Stevenson","popularity":0.9579,"profile_path":"/qiS6E7t5EbqRpWToggQwC3xIdDF.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Ruth","credit_id":"694dddf223243afa15fb0c07","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5898490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sasha Syzonenk","original_name":"Sasha Syzonenk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"694dde3629dcd3763f7ad65b","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Wlaschiha","original_name":"Tom Wlaschiha","popularity":7.5678,"profile_path":"/3Qbdm6f7AFAImiRU1TTwQ5AtHMQ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Thomas","credit_id":"694dde49c9c7e50e988eb7ff","order":12}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1754,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1f3lZxiWHx8FExNWUaLzJRgvIp7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1169}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
