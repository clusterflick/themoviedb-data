Yet in the modern city, their presence is increasingly cast as a problem, and their ways of living as disruptions. By following their traces, this film essay points toward a different picture that questions the narratives we take for granted. Through more-than-human encounters filmed locally in Romania, and a critical detour from the official discourse, other ways of living begin to surface. Perhaps there’s more we can do to unmake the anthropocentric landscape. What would it take to coexist more justly with urban animals? This film strays with this question and its possible answers.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":284442,"logo_path":null,"name":"just wondering...","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2025-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"a film essay with urban animals","title":"Straying home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900806,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Aron Nor","original_name":"Aron Nor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"694fbdde62d4bc62698123c5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900800,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mina Mimosa","original_name":"Mina Mimosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694fbcda23243afa15fb12b5","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900800,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mina Mimosa","original_name":"Mina Mimosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694fbce9da1253e059074d29","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Rotoscoping Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900806,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Aron Nor","original_name":"Aron Nor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694fbd3051a689d7eb072fd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900806,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Aron Nor","original_name":"Aron Nor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694fbd3a8bdfaabf07155274","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900806,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Aron Nor","original_name":"Aron Nor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694fbd495950358f20812231","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900806,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Aron Nor","original_name":"Aron Nor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694fbd4f36987783922fbf53","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900809,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.
