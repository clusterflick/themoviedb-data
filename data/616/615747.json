Shot in saturated 16mm colour, this dreamlike film follows a primeval female figure exploring an ancient landscape poised over an endlessly blue sea. She is at once alienated from and engaged by her surroundings, which suggest a site of self-discovery as much as one of profound disorientation.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kinetics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1737260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Atoosa Pour Hosseini","original_name":"Atoosa Pour Hosseini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2c72e3caab6d19c59d4fd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
