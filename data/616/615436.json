Today they live with the consequences: sheep graze in radioactive giant bomb craters and in the most affected villages 1 in 20 children are born with birth defects. Dr Toleukhan Nurmagambetov, the boss of the city's maternity clinic, wants a genetic passport which will prevent those with suspect genes from giving birth. Bibigul - a local woman from the test-site - is pregnant and her \"defected and frightful\" face arouses the suspicion of local medical staff. Nurmagambetov labels her a genetic failure. He implores Bibigul to get tested and abort the child who he fears will be born disabled. Will Bibigul give in? If not, will her child be disabled?","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":101701,"logo_path":"/uqlHSPjt2wdmDDwqd9l4jTdG779.png","name":"Dartmouth Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":78496,"logo_path":"/e8JC6pK5BRyFhCLmIq0F9rcSqGZ.png","name":"Tigerlily Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A nation afraid to give birth","title":"After the Apocalypse","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2361633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antony Butts","original_name":"Antony Butts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2b14e5a294f000103211cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1825646","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
