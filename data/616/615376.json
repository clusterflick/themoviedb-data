Three online video creators are trying in vain to create a viral video. They have cute, boring spots that are largely ignored on YouTube-and they have increasingly impatient investors. Enter a mysterious consultant whose videos have garnered millions of hits-by dispensing with good taste. Overjoyed by their newfound success, the team pops out one popular video after another, from Sasquatch and Yeti in a curling match to \"Breast Feeding While Driving\". But as their business starts to take off, they realize that they know nothing about their consultant. Co-writer/director Taylor Guterson (Old Goats) partnered with Erik Alskog (co-writer/director, cast-member) to produce Viral Viral -- a darkly comedic tale of the crackpot underbelly of public media where nothing is off-limits in the quest for hits.","popularity":0.0669,"poster_path":"/vpUpi9wjCUqxEEOCGVkiAOjYxfB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Just how low will they go for a YouTube sensation?","title":"Viral Viral","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Alskog","original_name":"Erik Alskog","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Erik","credit_id":"5d2ad636a294f0001030e09f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2361436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lull Mengesha","original_name":"Lull Mengesha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lull","credit_id":"5d2ad667a294f028462e0b74","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2361437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Nagamatsu","original_name":"Nadine Nagamatsu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nadine","credit_id":"5d2ad68abe4b3612f5a96f83","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3538025,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Dimity","original_name":"Andrea Dimity","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627450ffbdc34c00507b4e7a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Alskog","original_name":"Erik Alskog","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2ad6abcaab6d1e8196fa1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8212236","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vpUpi9wjCUqxEEOCGVkiAOjYxfB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
