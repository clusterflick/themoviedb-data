Filmed in a gay bar, the roving camera hesitates on a woman’s face, on some lilies, on small groups of people drinking and enjoying themselves and on the proverbial kiss between two women. As if on cue, ten lesbians gather in line at the bar and nonchalantly perform a synchronised dance. A sublime fantasy, with pleasure as protest.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/co3nZnNC0s9s5uqInK0b624f9bu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Wanted Green Lawns","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1302686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Turner","original_name":"Sarah Turner","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2b84c3a294f00010337d8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/co3nZnNC0s9s5uqInK0b624f9bu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
