Recognized and respected SFX maestro, he has also directed two full-length films which left their mark on sci-fi cinema: \"Silent Running\" and \"Brainstorm\". Today, at over 70, Trumbull-the-pioneer continues his quest for innovation and still dreams of a cinema which places spectators into the film. \"Trumbull Land\" is an immersive portrait of Douglas Trumbull in his studios and a diving headfirst in his cinema.","popularity":1.2082,"poster_path":"/ueqsk74i06NLLw2o3eW4nyyOj2L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12430,"logo_path":"/lkWMDyfpBYL1hVnVCd9CvexQqQz.png","name":"Vivement lundi
