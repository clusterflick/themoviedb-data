Sara belongs to an ultra-modern household, her mother is learning to be a classical musician and her father is an open minded person. On the other hand Sultan’s father is a feudal lord from Punjab with a warm heart, his mother a traditionalist. Everything seems fine until the two families meet for the first time. Sara knows that her parents would never let her move to a village after her marriage with Sultan, and Sultan is certain that her mother would never accept Sara’s families’ ultra-modern ways.","popularity":0.2036,"poster_path":"/ieLcZJSU3goQnS71rsj305cxU5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119410,"logo_path":"/iRkrwWKA3tL3JGepC613G4af1hi.png","name":"Film Factory","origin_country":"PK"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rok Sako To Rok Lo","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mehmood Aslam","original_name":"Mehmood Aslam","popularity":0.2784,"profile_path":"/ybbfFjlyD5HoEPGNGtzT53AoRbq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sultan's Abba/Father","credit_id":"5d28ea74caab6d0f719919e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1254961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hina Dilpazeer","original_name":"Hina Dilpazeer","popularity":0.4071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sultan's Amma/Mother","credit_id":"5d28eaa0a294f0000f29e138","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1503569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shehzad Sheikh","original_name":"Shehzad Sheikh","popularity":0.2237,"profile_path":"/61R9PrpMvia7QSNvUtuM5fJ2cwM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sultan","credit_id":"5d28eacfcaab6d0f71991aae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javed Sheikh","original_name":"Javed Sheikh","popularity":0.9064,"profile_path":"/mjrjECrCqS11TkFfvc8j7IcYKq3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sara's Father","credit_id":"5d28eae8be4b3612f6a2325c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2103957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kinza Hashmi","original_name":"Kinza Hashmi","popularity":0.3743,"profile_path":"/cVbCM2IYvvJ2dXOXK9v5W97GRNP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sara","credit_id":"5d28eafbefea7a00102066b7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1254513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farah Shah","original_name":"Farah Shah","popularity":0.3111,"profile_path":"/mBj6dx0iDTox2UAa3tsfcgLBv8O.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sara's Mother","credit_id":"5d28eb2ca294f0001129e3f0","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1876674,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Faiza Iftikhar","original_name":"Faiza Iftikhar","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":"/bKGqGK9G8cgtUdEOndTi5ONnZW3.jpg","credit_id":"5d28eb465f6c491be35e3f19","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kashif Saleem","original_name":"Kashif Saleem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d28eb5ca294f0001229e021","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kashif Saleem","original_name":"Kashif Saleem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d28eb6fcaab6d00129c703b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10230042","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sIzzXSwHIxMgPD6dUfTfF17B1HP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ieLcZJSU3goQnS71rsj305cxU5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ur","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rok Sako To Rok Lo - Telefilm - HAR PAL GEO","key":"wm4ujvVHj6w","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-06-08T15:00:07.000Z","id":"5d28ebfcbe4b3612f5a26332"}]}}}
