She returns to the United States and meets Duncan MacKail, who is equally broke though he owns grainland in the West. Duncan and Chaddie are married and go west to homestead. Duncan hires Ollie, a Swedish caretaker, who frightens Chaddie. When business takes Duncan away, Chaddie goes to take care of Percy Woodhouse, an Englishman who has become ill at his place fifteen miles away. Her horse runs away, and she is forced to spend the night there. She sleeps under a wagon, but Duncan is nevertheless angry and jealous.","popularity":0.3206,"poster_path":"/mmSR8c0ExrYAOl8sk4MrSQFwMRv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prairie Wife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1262043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Devore","original_name":"Dorothy Devore","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":"/gGdrV5khPtejk2HQEzohcCDhpjY.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Chaddie Green","credit_id":"5d29064cbe4b36756a9e7804","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Rawlinson","original_name":"Herbert Rawlinson","popularity":0.2357,"profile_path":"/siWyKk2R5OfDhdJHYtlAPdYuXAc.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Duncan MacKail","credit_id":"5d2906545f6c491be35e8dc5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gibson Gowland","original_name":"Gibson Gowland","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/5peWO8JpDAgeb5NPGoOWvkpiyhX.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Ollie","credit_id":"5d290659be4b3612f5a2ac98","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Stuart","original_name":"Leslie Stuart","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/HCaA6HVKpeij2hACPR13VKkSvb.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Percy","credit_id":"5d290663a294f0000f2a357d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2360477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Primm","original_name":"Frances Primm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Olga (as Frances Prim)","credit_id":"5d29066bbe4b3612f5a2acb3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Karloff","original_name":"Boris Karloff","popularity":0.7586,"profile_path":"/fVi0QkiziavXB8HnWk5NzRcnCO1.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Diego","credit_id":"5d290672a294f000112a3a39","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erich von Ritzau","original_name":"Erich von Ritzau","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"617c08785294e70044ffb4d3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3289244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rupert Franklin","original_name":"Rupert Franklin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Rufus Green","credit_id":"617c08875aba32002950aa86","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":195086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alphonse Martell","original_name":"Alphonse Martell","popularity":0.178,"profile_path":"/qNiH6gjtc905FZlsMYJVfOrcxIJ.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Count de Chateaunois (uncredited)","credit_id":"617c089d5294e70065130948","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1010504,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katherine Hilliker","original_name":"Katherine Hilliker","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/qCzx2WgBWZydkz9vw2ctBLp7LN3.jpg","credit_id":"5d290617be4b36756a9e77a7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":575491,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arthur Stringer","original_name":"Arthur Stringer","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2905f75f6c496ff25e8242","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1010724,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"H.H.
