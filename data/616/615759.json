As interest in regenerating soil explodes worldwide, Hawthorne discovers that David Vetter is way ahead of the game. With both historical context and an eye to the future, Dreaming of a Vetter World shows it's possible to jump off conventional agriculture's pesticide treadmill. It's also a story about love, hope and place; an inspiring example of perseverance and doing what you know is right--against all odds.","popularity":0.3531,"poster_path":"/jDenesiNp9iTok1li4jo5tVk4JK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"On the Vetter farm, their most important crop is the soil.","title":"Dreaming of a Vetter World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David J.
