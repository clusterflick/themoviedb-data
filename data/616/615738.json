A rumor is spreading again in this legendary place, as eyewitnesses report an animal with large paws and a long tail that crosses roads in a single leap - powerful enough to tear down a horse and leave it mutilated in the pasture. Is the Beast of Gévaudan back? The animal photographer Bruno Loisel has a supposedly more rational explanation. The animal that fits the descriptions could be a cougar, but this species of big cat is only native to America. In order to learn the proper techniques for tracking down the puma, he travels to Canada, where he accompanies a team of researchers dedicated to studying the shy, almost invisible predator. Will Bruno be able to use his findings to solve the mystery of the new beast of Gévaudan?","popularity":0.5216,"poster_path":"/xXVVvzkoWdC6pyNq6hvNkZxFYvr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18762,"logo_path":"/oJWmIqNYC4phwDpMuhGO9KNW07H.png","name":"Mona Lisa
