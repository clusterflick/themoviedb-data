Many canvases, hitherto believed to be by the hand of the Master, are now thought to be the work of artists who learnt their craft in his studio by copying his style. The film is a fascinating study of modern scientific techniques, a comprehensive art historical view of Rembrandtâ€™s work over the centuries and a reaffirmation of his genius.","popularity":0.0574,"poster_path":"/iM61OzJfJ0mcsoRWMcdJtyEkHJC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Rembrandt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Real Rembrandt: The Search for a Genius","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garard Green","original_name":"Garard Green","popularity":0.1131,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6152e04fdd731b008b89aa17","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kees van Langeraad","original_name":"Kees van Langeraad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6152dfc6d1ca2a00673b2e00","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3250861,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Hulshof","original_name":"George Hulshof","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6152dfee67203d00916e5249","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3250863,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jet Willers","original_name":"Jet Willers","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6152e00b9974ee0043ef5282","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kees van Langeraad","original_name":"Kees van Langeraad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2be45fa294f03e882bd143","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6667540","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iM61OzJfJ0mcsoRWMcdJtyEkHJC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
