Written in the style of poems dedicated to my daughter, they line the whole itinerary, at times stuck to windows , whether of trains, stations or museums, at times held by people met in the street.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to London","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2357126,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cécile Ravel","original_name":"Cécile Ravel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d29daa8be4b3612f5a5c124","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
