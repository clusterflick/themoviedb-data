In the spirit of daredevil Evel Knievel, Hodges recently attempted to jump farther than anyone ever has on a motorcycle – a distance that was set in 2011 at 378 feet and 9 inches by Robbie Maddison – and severely injured both ankles prior to the live show. In the revamped show, beginning at 9pm ET, exclusive crash footage of Hodges will be revealed and four-time X Games Medalist Vicki Golden will aim to set a new world record in an epic live motorcycle firewall stunt.","popularity":0.6116,"poster_path":"/4DfM02uWR2ue21AeELGnmgRmcDo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116082,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nitro Circus Media Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evel Live 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1319762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Iseman","original_name":"Matt Iseman","popularity":0.2533,"profile_path":"/xdOA5gbPth7EYFlKKxHxpBcGjKU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Host","credit_id":"5d2de316839d930011ef5ef2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Travis Pastrana","original_name":"Travis Pastrana","popularity":0.2976,"profile_path":"/rBM4FMcqMaQeNlqugRiY62Sj5JL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Host","credit_id":"5d2de3396a300b0010a46bf2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2363174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ginger Zee","original_name":"Ginger Zee","popularity":0.1864,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself - Weather Analyst","credit_id":"5d2de355a294f0548a2b3496","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1248978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberly Pressler","original_name":"Kimberly Pressler","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/mPPFxermLzO1U0NeC9MqzvN6YxS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herself - Sideline Reporter","credit_id":"5d2de36d66e4690010808f8a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lathan McKay","original_name":"Lathan McKay","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - Panelist","credit_id":"5d2de383a294f064562ea70e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2363175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axell Hodges","original_name":"Axell Hodges","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d2de391839d93000fef5fb8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2097405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicki Golden","original_name":"Vicki Golden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d2de3a2839d930011ef5f9d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2363179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robbie Maddison","original_name":"Robbie Maddison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself - Panelist","credit_id":"5d2de3f3839d93000eef5c77","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2363180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Coleman","original_name":"Jimmy Coleman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself - Panelist","credit_id":"5d2de42f6a300b5922a1ad45","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2363181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Sorokanich","original_name":"Bob Sorokanich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself - Panelist","credit_id":"5d2de445a294f0548a2b36c5","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1224281,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mary E.
