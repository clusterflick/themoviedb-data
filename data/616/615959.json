Indeed such a showing of \"compulsive ordinariness\" conceals his predicament of autistic isolation. Therefore, as he attempts to make up the illusion of an ideal world, he daily puts on a pantomime of the \"perfect neighborhood\", which is painstakingly staged by a group of paid walk on people. While such an artifice seems to help him fulfill his unexpressed love dream, a harsh overwhelming reality forces him to give up his illusions and eventually get in touch with the imperfect human dimension. The Plastic Cardboard Sonata is a story of urban loneliness, featuring lyric suggestions in the context of a paradoxical frame. By means of an accurate use of silence it sketches out the essence of daily life malaise.","popularity":0.0627,"poster_path":"/nT4bw6o3A1X2Xxe5w5gHWcWTVl5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
