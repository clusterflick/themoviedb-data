Before Shamus arrives for the switch, Poppo's thugs accidentally give the money to Shamus look-alike Dave Rickards, a radio host in the wrong place at the wrong time. Rickards is chased through the streets of San Diego and onto a train, where he makes a clean get-away with the cash. Now Poppo wants both the video and his money back, but must contend with the FBI, con men, and his long-time nemesis \"The Greek\". Despite advice from San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders and Watergate legend G. Gordon Liddy, Rickards loses track of both the money and the video-tape. He is then tricked into a dramatic showdown with Kaiser Poppo and a 30-year-old secret is finally revealed.
