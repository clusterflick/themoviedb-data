Young Vergel left his family to take as job as a miner, and following a long stretch away from home he returns and enjoys a reunion with his younger siblings, a mischievous brother and a sister who is newly aware of matters of the heart. All is well in the household until Vergel makes a startling discovery -- there are gold deposits on the family's farm. Vergel's first concern is the safety and well-being of his family, but as the value of the gold claim rises, his lust for money begins to overpower his common sense and regard for others.","popularity":0.0966,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stone Is the Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","title":"Ang Mundo Sa Panahon Ng Bato","type":"Original title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1147017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin Pamanian","original_name":"Edwin Pamanian","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Vergel","credit_id":"52fe4b899251416c910ddbfd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mes de Guzman","original_name":"Mes de Guzman","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/As7O0IhC7Lu9plso5RmXWc674Ro.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b899251416c910ddc03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185503,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Albert Banzon","original_name":"Albert Banzon","popularity":0.1233,"profile_path":"/nub0tHubv3eBFUII3COe3NubifC.jpg","credit_id":"661a959e8c3159015fc0f66d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2744408,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Remil Diaz","original_name":"Remil Diaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f397d1a15a4a10035000547","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2744409,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rene De Guzman","original_name":"Rene De Guzman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f397d3ea3b5e60034f015e5","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mes de Guzman","original_name":"Mes de Guzman","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/As7O0IhC7Lu9plso5RmXWc674Ro.jpg","credit_id":"5f397cf746aed4003460dc13","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mes de Guzman","original_name":"Mes de Guzman","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/As7O0IhC7Lu9plso5RmXWc674Ro.jpg","credit_id":"5f397d0a397df000369b2c9b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1663313","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
