Like \"Some Kind of Monster\", \"Metallimania\" was also financed with METALLICA money for the band's own private amusement, a way to document what was then the longest tour of its career: nearly three years playing all over the world in support of its self-titled 1991 album. Cribbed from thousands of hours of camcorder footage taken at outdoor festivals, \"Metallimania\" freezes in amber for future generations the group in its last mullet-wearing \"ALCOHOLICA\" days and some of METALLICA's drunkest, scariest and most confused devotees.","popularity":0.0414,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metallica: Metallimania","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0176988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
