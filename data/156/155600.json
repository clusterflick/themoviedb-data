Despite speculation, Holopainen said in a Finnish interview that the female doubles in this video have nothing to do with the removal of Tarja Turunen from Nightwish, saying \"It's just pure self-irony and rock 'n' roll\". The four models are referring to the rumor going around the fans that Anette Olzon, the new singer, was chosen to attract more fans because of her looks. In the video, they make fun of the rumor. The video was released on September 27, 2007.","popularity":0.2582,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":48264,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roadrunner Records","origin_country":""},{"id":48265,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spinefarm Records","origin_country":""},{"id":4975,"logo_path":null,"name":"nuclear blast","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2008-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nightwish: Bye Bye Beautiful","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":574142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tuomas Holopainen","original_name":"Tuomas Holopainen","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":"/uyxgHYCKOdWTjsiVRbikhcdlulp.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"54ff0989c3a368109800186b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":574143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Hietala","original_name":"Marco Hietala","popularity":0.0758,"profile_path":"/oLkpDyr6oqc3KImYwfwWsm7k28p.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"54ff09929251410e510017dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jukka Nevalainen","original_name":"Jukka Nevalainen","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/2vbsXqQ8Vosv5jlaxIjQdLojFMD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54ff0999c3a368150c0017fa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":574145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emppu Vuorinen","original_name":"Emppu Vuorinen","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/hknVcGHzBjgk9PbkzcvuyGF30iM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54ff09a19251410e540019c0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":574144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anette Olzon","original_name":"Anette Olzon","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":"/yPFxovCTItk9k75N3YmVsfulV2H.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54ff09a8c3a368150c0017fc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450459,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Thorpe","original_name":"John Thorpe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5522453e9251415c870051cc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antti J.
