Youth from all over come to Haifa to join this religion, and those who serve in the gardens that surround the holy places develop peace-loving attitudes through their interactions with nature. The ﬁlmmaker shares with his son the idea that if the Iranian people had adopted a peaceful religion, Iran would not be preparing a nuclear attack on Israel, but the son believes that all religions tend to bring about destruction. As a result of these arguments, father and son separate from one another and pursue their own paths.","popularity":0.2446,"poster_path":"/dMqcnGKrvsQyyxz0uYTs5V4CfUC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13518,"logo_path":"/4k4pfsETuAGPlmJ3yLkiTmOi9v1.png","name":"Makhmalbaf Film House
