What exchanges take place through the object itselfâ€”sensually, esthetically, abstractly?

How does their labor, their aspirations, their sense of alienation or satisfaction connect to ours?","popularity":0.0962,"poster_path":"/2gq6OMFyG5vlILOPuiS4na4JEpJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Daniel Eisenberg Films","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unstable Object","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1136489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Eisenberg","original_name":"Daniel Eisenberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b7b9251416c910dbd41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1958065","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2gq6OMFyG5vlILOPuiS4na4JEpJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rDZ4f0dnvBvZLbhzj6jvOL4agJN.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zzzfAZjkqgAf2ULHGjvrnXcX2t9.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
