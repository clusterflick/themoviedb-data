Little Szymon, playing with his friends, becomes the perpetrator of a car accident in which the parents of a little girl, Magda, die. She herself comes out of the catastrophe unscathed. This event has an indelible mark on the boy's psyche. Twenty years pass. Szymon is a railwayman, Magda works at a cosmetics company. She doesn't remember anything about her childhood, and her life passes between work and disco. Her granddaughter Ola is looked after by her grandmother. During one of the crazy games, a young woman meets Szymon. This is not an accidental meeting, because the man - tormented by guilt - has long tried to find out something about her. Magda initially rejects Szymon's courtship. Over time, however, the mysterious admirer begins to fascinate her.","popularity":0.3487,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20792,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmowe
