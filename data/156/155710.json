The film charts his search for knowledge and understanding, during a decline in his family's circumstances, that leads him to revelations on the nature of art, beauty, and politics. However, his personal renaissance makes him feel unwelcome in his own country, and forces him to make a choice between exile as artist or staying and facing personal defeat.","popularity":1.7997,"poster_path":"/1qEln2nz34zHTHwcYIlMbdbMABo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ulysses Film Production Ltd","origin_country":""},{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÃ‰","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1977-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"James Joyce: A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bosco Hogan","original_name":"Bosco Hogan","popularity":0.1821,"profile_path":"/sMa4b3F9KoHqReJ84pVybL0atQ2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Stephen Dedalus","credit_id":"52fe4b859251416c910dd45d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.
