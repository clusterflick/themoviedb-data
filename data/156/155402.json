An initially reserved Albert Hall crowd quickly responds to the uptempo excitement the band create, cast aside their inhibitions and make this a real party - some even joining the band on stage at one point. Originally formed in Miami in 1989 The Mavericks were the premier alternative country /tex-mex band of the 90's, with no fewer than 14 Billboard chart singles and 6 albums to their credit. The band finally split up in 2003, and this 59 minute DVD displays them at their best with all their hits.","popularity":0.0484,"poster_path":"/5vJwaaIxZQyYgsfKvaHQuaTUJAf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mavericks - Live at the Royal Albert Hall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raul Malo","original_name":"Raul Malo","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/kRV687MhmewayyliGADMLoivmeK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"lead vocals","credit_id":"647571631bf2660442a74f8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2739683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Deakin","original_name":"Paul Deakin","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"drums","credit_id":"5f33ecdf0582240037ac5209","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Reynolds","original_name":"Robert Reynolds","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"bass guitar","credit_id":"647571b6c2823a0106df825e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2119868,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jerry Dale McFadden","original_name":"Jerry Dale McFadden","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"keyboard","credit_id":"647571e1bbcae000de635265","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Kane","original_name":"Nick Kane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"guitar","credit_id":"647571f51bf266043d2fddc0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"The Havana Horns","original_name":"The Havana Horns","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"support","credit_id":"647572111bf266044146bf40","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5vJwaaIxZQyYgsfKvaHQuaTUJAf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8WHZmfigI9Yn5wnSyjIhMqX71nt.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
