While the painting depicts people gathered on an island in the Seine, the musical goes beyond simply describing their lives. It is an exploration of art, of love, of commitment. Seurat connected dots to create images; Lapine and Sondheim use connection as the heart of all our relationships. Winner of the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Originally broadcast as part of \"American Playhouse\" on PBS (season five, episode nineteen).","popularity":2.8943,"poster_path":"/gu0LyMftRvGeCJEJ5MtpVcrtJOY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3025,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brandman
