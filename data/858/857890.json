Many Goddard engineers are trained divers. These engineers work along side the astronauts while in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab to aid in their training. This underwater experience helps HST engineers understand what the astronauts need as they work together to refine tools and procedures to service Hubble","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jUuHPM2EmohLrw9VgdLu1y3mU20.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Goddard Space Flight Centre Divers","title":"Goddard Space Flight Centre Divers","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jUuHPM2EmohLrw9VgdLu1y3mU20.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
