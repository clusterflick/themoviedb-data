This place also lends its name to a contemporary art project that commenced in 2001. Every three years, artist Darius Ziura shoots a one-minute video portrait of every villager that has agreed to participate in the project. These portraits are then pieced together and edited into a film. With every episode, the project expands it’s time spectrum, thus reflecting on changes both in people’s age and lifestyle, as well as the evolution of social structures and processes, which are affected by the changing socio-political situation in the country. This project also reflects on the rapid changes in filming techniques and editing strategies, presenting the different trends of visual culture of every period.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2020-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gustoniai in Gustoniai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3184703,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darius Žiūra","original_name":"Darius Žiūra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6108de578d22fc004715351e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598474,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eitvydas Doškus","original_name":"Eitvydas Doškus","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/a42t2FW11Y4tRGnSr6jGDeS1Zuf.jpg","credit_id":"67f245b9eddec28b03ad59e0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3025576,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ignė Narbutaitė","original_name":"Ignė Narbutaitė","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f245e41bb04728999917df","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2040873,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sigitas Motoras","original_name":"Sigitas Motoras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f24705f5a80aa54599d184","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36456358","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lt","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
