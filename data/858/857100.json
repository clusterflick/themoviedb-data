This couldn't be more true with the songstress of Fleetwood Mac. For decades, she has fronted one of the most successful bands in history, resurrecting them from the ashes. Even with the trials and tribulations of being a member of Fleetwood Mac, Stevie has remained an iconic role model. Staying synonymous with the witchy, transcendental, deep rooted mysticism of a fairy god mother. Through her drive and passion for creating art, the Bohemian Rock Queen found an avenue to overcome her obstacles, going on to become the only woman inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame, twice. Relive the turbulent life of one of the last old school rock stars left.","popularity":0.4209,"poster_path":"/dITLAV98IYcjWxfOzkgA33jB90O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entertain Me Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stevie Nicks: Wild at Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stevie Nicks","original_name":"Stevie Nicks","popularity":0.3097,"profile_path":"/n8gLNEXq7GNO4gH4MDsvYOlwuLE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61077e717d5f4b005e8cbbd7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piers Garland","original_name":"Piers Garland","popularity":0.2467,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61077c8faad9c2004656131d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piers Garland","original_name":"Piers Garland","popularity":0.2467,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61079becf10a1a00752461c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14540334","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kLzY3Hzq5P8pn6s0VqfS3GPnyhl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dITLAV98IYcjWxfOzkgA33jB90O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"STEVIE NICKS - WILD AT HEART TRAILER","key":"uTdap4RFNbA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-11T13:50:45.000Z","id":"61077f8a6a300b007529115c"}]}}}
