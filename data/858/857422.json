Hiro had also moved in with his former girlfriend Mitsuru, but Makio did not pry into that and silently burned Mitsuru's picture. From then on, Makio began to lose his memory from time to time. Whenever he lost his memory, Hiro felt something eerie about Makio's unusual behavior. This is because he resembles Mitsuru's appearance. Hiro begins to search for Mitsuru, but finds no clues. Then, Makio asks him, “Why did you leave me?” and he fainted. The two decide to confront the mystery. One day, Makio finds a man who looks like Mitsuru and chases after him. Kazuki, an exorcist, stops him. He tells Makio that a terrifying spirit is haunting him. Makio asks him to exorcise the spirit... Can you believe it? Can you believe in the supreme love of madness?","popularity":0.1421,"poster_path":"/y5kZViWaufPZLoYzPUmZxQUvOHs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2002-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Lovers","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ranran Nakayama","original_name":"Ranran Nakayama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67f6baa91bc639566ad9366c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1249146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroko Shimabukuro","original_name":"Hiroko Shimabukuro","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67f6bab7cce7690230acf5ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinobu Miyazawa","original_name":"Shinobu Miyazawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67f6badc7b43bdce20ade64d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaito Nono","original_name":"Kaito Nono","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67f6bae86c3583c97599d82a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1485822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Minoru Kunizawa","original_name":"国沢実","popularity":0.13,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610836be7719d7002c9ec308","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8085330","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kGolZTr8fayhBrzEo5Rufetfvva.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/y5kZViWaufPZLoYzPUmZxQUvOHs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":159551,"name":"pink film"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"},{"id":328767,"name":"gay pink film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
