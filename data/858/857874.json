In order to dismantle this stigmatization, other images must be presented or we need to reveal what the existing ones seek to cover up. The slum is usually represented from a limited and deceitful visual panorama. This representation has an intention. Cinema and television are two image-producing devices that strengthen the stereotypes that we have about the people who inhabit these spaces. And what happens in the field of painting? Do clichés reign there too?  This visual essay seeks to confront various works by national painters and sculptors, belonging to the Palais collection, with the kinetic images of current cinema and television, to reflect on both the differences and the similarities in the meanings and discourses that both regimes of images can produce.\"  César González","popularity":0.2446,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":158487,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palais de Glace","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2021-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"sin título","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1770551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"César González","original_name":"César González","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1u3NtAA9oETaV5yDLiGGB6DXeBh.jpg","credit_id":"6109ef2a9f5dfb002a2fe21f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5918,"name":"painting"},{"id":12987,"name":"poverty"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":15478,"name":"art gallery"},{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"#ElMuseoAprende César González: “sin título”","key":"aTGfsaBAq7s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2021-07-31T16:00:11.000Z","id":"6109f01fc613ce007f7e6bf6"}]}}}
