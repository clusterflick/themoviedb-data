Countless hits are connected with his name. In his obituary, Oliver Schwabe shows the most important points in Biolek’s life. From the beginnings in cabaret, through his work as the producer of the TV show “Am laufenden Band” and his way onto the stage. That’s where he was pulled to, and there he had his greatest successes: ‘Bio’s Bahnhof’, ‘Mensch Meier’, ‘Boulevard Bio’, or ‘Alfredissimo’ with millions of viewers in front of their tv screens. His work and his life are put into perspective by Biolek himself over and over again in candid and often touching words.","popularity":0.3191,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tschüss Bio!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Biolek","original_name":"Alfred Biolek","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self (archival footage)","credit_id":"61096d4738469a005ca6931a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3185322,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rita Kegelmann","original_name":"Rita Kegelmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61096e6d38469a007245e64a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616573,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Adrian Lehnigk","original_name":"Adrian Lehnigk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61096db97719d70072c2c754","department":"Crew","job":"Editorial Staff"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544766,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Schwabe","original_name":"Oliver Schwabe","popularity":0.1572,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61096e5f2f8d09002d1abc4a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":172417,"name":"obituary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
