In Haiti, men perceived as feminine are known as masisi. The word is often used as a slur on gay men, transvestites and non-binary folks. Sanba Yonel comments on the plight of the masisi who, faced with prejudice and hostility, find shelter in the religious context of Vodou.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4Fl74p9DXkFrG9bfoGo3rYppMxM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HT","name":"Haiti"}],"release_date":"2021-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Haitian;
