The classic combination of airframe, Rolls Royce Merlin engine and dual cannon/machine gun armament struck terror into the hearts of the enemy's most fearless flyers and won the type a place in history as a timeless thoroughbred fighter. The Spitfire fought in the front line throughout the war, and rightly remains and aviation legend today. Combining dramatic wartime film with colour footage of surviving Spitfires in flight, this is the definitive documentary of a thoroughbred fighter.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/baRetWGXcRAEEpeMv8Wz1mYN6CM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ultimate Story Of the Spitfire","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/baRetWGXcRAEEpeMv8Wz1mYN6CM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
