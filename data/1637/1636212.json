The parents of the young couple are happy. While the wedding preparations are underway and the apartment is being renovated, the future in-laws decide to spend some time together at the summer house to “get used to each other” and get to know one another better.  However, living under one roof turns out to be far less pleasant than it seemed. Every day, conflicts flare up between the in-laws over seemingly trivial matters. No sooner is one argument settled than another begins.  Yet true love ultimately reconciles these “very different people.” Both families want their children to be happy — just each in their own way. And in the end, harmony finally descends upon the feuding households.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/pxDvQwnQ0oytDOFcnDl4Lm1J5k0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":187,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"And at last, harmony comes to the warring families.","title":"Strawberry Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1178490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Tumaykina","original_name":"Ольга Тумайкина","popularity":0.8876,"profile_path":"/nGeDU2HItTnhLEw38M5OzwF22I.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"699225ee91f837c2d4fa3359","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Shcherbakov","original_name":"Борис Щербаков","popularity":2.91,"profile_path":"/eFQC3x2WvWvJZ0eRohUdYMWMUP8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"699226126d6ccf38341af09f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2443847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelina Sakuro","original_name":"Эвелина Сакуро","popularity":0.1717,"profile_path":"/nNm257UrbMYi8zxEHtIWgV2uS29.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"699226239717d0dc9d0652d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2901447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Parshin","original_name":"Денис Паршин","popularity":0.3655,"profile_path":"/nBe2zDhFyvkrhtixOC98wZ3OyZe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6992263358cfac1f8e958f93","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2799106,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sergey Girgel","original_name":"Sergey Girgel","popularity":0.8143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699226579717d0dc9d0652d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_3166_1":"RU","iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/pxDvQwnQ0oytDOFcnDl4Lm1J5k0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"12+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
