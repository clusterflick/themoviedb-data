It turned out that he had testicular cancer and one month later he was lying in hospital waiting to have his murderous gonad removed. Would he survive? (No spoilers!)  For a comedian who had done a whole show about male genitalia (Talking Cock) and written a book about toxic masculinity (The Problem With Men), this seemed like a cruel twist of fate.  But because he’s a comedian, he was able to get a book and a stand-up tour out of it all. And now he’s got a DVD too! Recorded at the Gordon Craig Theatre in Stevenage (just 1.9 miles from where Richard’s knacker was excised) by the fabulous gofasterstripe.com crew.  Featuring a special appearance by Right Bollock and with extras including one of the first live performances of this material, the full audio podcast series and a commentary track from a mystery celebrity.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/9twZOesEfQoIKUrUyEVVLED0Le0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33022,"logo_path":"/5d2uhejtffJP8vPgVeBH5jv0emd.png","name":"Go Faster Stripe","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richard Herring: Can I Have My Ball Back?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Herring","original_name":"Richard Herring","popularity":0.2253,"profile_path":"/wAJmlNYuo3Pvz6lPY32O3HrXRLh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"69939a6e48c917cd226f7274","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9twZOesEfQoIKUrUyEVVLED0Le0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
