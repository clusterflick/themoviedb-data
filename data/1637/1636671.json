After this, commentators Pekka Tiilikainen and Eero Leväluoma and announcers Matti Tamminen and Kaisu Puuska, among others, join the campaign. \"Uncle Markus\" Rautio and parliamentary reporter Leo Meller also testify to the breadth of the program. The film moves from the room of program director Jussi Koskiluoma to the studios and workshops, until the camera has to face the director general at a session of the program council. The popular \"Mini Parliament\" gets a place when the \"Radio Discussion Club\", which has been meeting since the summer of 1945, lets its candidates elected by parliamentary power be heard by all the people, led by SKDL's Hella Wuolijoki.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21046,"logo_path":"/ghVwr2Y0DgRbg3b4Mm3FVdhJ6Fo.png","name":"Suomi-Filmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1947-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yleisradion päivä","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1953732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl-Erik Creutz","original_name":"Carl-Erik Creutz","popularity":0.4066,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6993218a2c5ae42082fa36e4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Holger Harrivirta","original_name":"Holger Harrivirta","popularity":0.2815,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69932157c8dc8a02df0657f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9269250","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"","release_date":"1947-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
