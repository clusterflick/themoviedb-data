What is the state of racism in the Netherlands, and how can we engage in conversation about it? In the 2018 performance, George Elias Tobal and Eran Ben-Michaël, together with Myrthe Huber and Milan Sekeris from Nordgrond, make this major theme understandable and relatable by playing with the underlying mechanisms that everyone recognizes. Stimulating, provocative, and uncomfortable, full of humor and music.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/sV2puc6VySErl9KkdXo90sVpvHa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"George and Eran Become Racists","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3192617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milan Sekeris","original_name":"Milan Sekeris","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":"/oLGYBI00me3JWt69i7593JLEP14.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"699374b0dde0cf5f23124b7d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2929294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myrthe Huber","original_name":"Myrthe Huber","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"699374bd7f884b8666fa3ba8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eran Ben-Michaël","original_name":"Eran Ben-Michaël","popularity":0.6036,"profile_path":"/aKkoKTVhTvZyb6VBETNjEhZGa3I.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"699374d077403baa2f1af81b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Tobal","original_name":"George Tobal","popularity":0.419,"profile_path":"/aVA4mfniuRx0FJvHUbmrlNLu8u8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"699374fe87d414d8ba124c19","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Koos Terpstra","original_name":"Koos Terpstra","popularity":0.1272,"profile_path":"/lk9Lu8SzRAAkJT9btbXEoJVd8pp.jpg","credit_id":"69937523ef35702faf959559","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6011815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sanne Verkaaik","original_name":"Sanne Verkaaik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699375638e515e6cd4287fbe","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6011816,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mats Boswijk","original_name":"Mats Boswijk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699375a4451955ec6428813b","department":"Art","job":"Decorator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qIdU8RmbUoFh89adLU2SP998jDu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sV2puc6VySErl9KkdXo90sVpvHa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
