As Mei pushes to retain the truth of her grandfather's story, a man both rumored to have executed and saved victims during the White Terror- she becomes entangled in a surreal spiral where the fictional officer on screen begins speaking directly to her conscience. While the crew continues filming under pressure, Mei must decide whether to conform or resist, knowing that to alter the truth is betraying his legacy and identity. As the lines blur between the film set and real life, she faces the unspoken truth: tyranny isn't just historical, systemic, cyclical, and personal.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tV80gQyMwJxWp3ss9rexIt4d8mR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2026-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some stories refuse to die.","title":"Commonality of Tyranny","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"片場勿語","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3658004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clover Hong","original_name":"Clover Hong","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":"/xpCivN9faqwUSbSo2LIMIXf8mw5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mei","credit_id":"69935d6111430905432af54e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6011588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Berton Yen","original_name":"Berton Yen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lin","credit_id":"69935d7a76fc6c7ae26f70d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6011589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yirong Yin","original_name":"Yirong Yin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Fei","credit_id":"69935da511430905432af565","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5717218,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"LIU Shuailiang","original_name":"LIU Shuailiang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69935dde76fc6c7ae26f70dc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4025822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ting-Li Tsai","original_name":"Ting-Li Tsai","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/2bk4JSGUkaHFrPChNaMmG4EpoAh.jpg","credit_id":"69935fe20450aa73e9065b02","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6011603,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pei-Ju Liao","original_name":"Pei-Ju Liao","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69936091d663a3a9c1850bc5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36891940","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2iumgq67H9W29dy9iN0hTKxbpAX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2481,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tV80gQyMwJxWp3ss9rexIt4d8mR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Dam Short Film Festival","release_date":"2026-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
