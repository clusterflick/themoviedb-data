Tender is a tribute to the care, responsibility, and quiet eccentricity of the goaltending position – exploring a lesser-seen side of some of the fiercest competitors in a brutal sport.  Told through the intertwined careers of Team USA goaltenders Aerin Frankel & Gwyneth Philips, this short documentary highlights the talents, habits, and quirks that make both athletes individually elite at their craft, while allowing their distinct personalities to shine through. It also examines the unique bond between goalie partners – a relationship defined by mutual trust and respect, forged over years as both teammates and opponents.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/y1B4pGj2vjuhuR6BA34k8nO1GrJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":289397,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allez!
