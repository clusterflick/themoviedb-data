As she moves in reverse to the music, her body appears detached from her will — choreography becoming compulsion. What begins as discipline slowly transforms into something darker: a loss of control where art overtakes the artist.\r Through minimal dialogue and a focus on movement, light, and rhythm, the film examines the cost of perfection and the fragile line between dedication and self-destruction.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/y4msRdkqICJZsohXEAETups5f82.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some Dances are Deadly","title":"Break A Leg","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6010048,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zeus Matanda","original_name":"Zeus Matanda","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5tCgfk9PBljmOhg647ydBFeUUNO.jpg","credit_id":"699260b327123675de959011","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6010088,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Caelan Noel","original_name":"Caelan Noel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699269a54c4c894d1106552a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6010092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastien Towers","original_name":"Sebastien Towers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699269c4949478aa346f6bd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y4msRdkqICJZsohXEAETups5f82.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Break A Leg - Short Experimental Film.","key":"FTrYvZL1OdA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2026-02-15T22:07:56.000Z","id":"699260233fbae15df32af141"}]}}}
