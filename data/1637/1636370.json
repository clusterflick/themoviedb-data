A safe place for children. Somewhere to meet at any hour. A cheap place to eat. A neighborhood landmark. Located on the corner of a major intersection in an established neighborhood, this Louisville White Castle restaurant meant a lot of things to a lot of people. For thirty two years. So when residents learned that White Castle #12 was to close its doors forever due to a rent dispute, there was a huge public reaction. Some were angry and frustrated, others were nostalgic. Many came out for one final cheeseburger or cup of coffee. A few held a candlelight vigil, others a birthday party. There were television and radio interviews, rap songs, stories, chess games and guys with paper bags over their heads. Whatever the gesture, thousands came out into the cold on December 21, 1988 for one simple reason - to bid an old and faithful friend farewell.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gs7JStXVSQuXQ5SornJeUn1UTM8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Germantown
