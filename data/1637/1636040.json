They watched their mothers leave at the dawn of their lives to go and work. What do they know of the generations that came before them and of their parents' exile, born in colonized territories? What do they know of their mothers' history and their choices to leave their homeland? The mothers recount the harshness of work, the isolation of exile, and the loneliness of motherhood. The echoes created between the words of mothers and daughters trace the paths of an emancipation built from generation to generation of women.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flamboyantes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laetitia Tura","original_name":"Laetitia Tura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6991cd6858eabfd84e287591","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
