The film invites viewers to accompany the oddly-named main character for a day at the office where you'll see him sit at his desk, buy a soda, sit at his desk, give a presentation, and sit at his desk! With a job this wacky, you never know what he'll do next, although it probably involves \"sitting\" and \"at his desk\".","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Johnsonerson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1710310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Smith","original_name":"Tom Smith","popularity":0.7784,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Boss, The Coworker, The Squirrel, Johnsonerson","credit_id":"6993962cbeda484cea2880af","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1710310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Smith","original_name":"Tom Smith","popularity":0.7784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699395db1f5614a9c79597a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1710310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Smith","original_name":"Tom Smith","popularity":0.7784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699395f80446285088124f8b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1710310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Smith","original_name":"Tom Smith","popularity":0.7784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6993960a1519eceeb8288003","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
