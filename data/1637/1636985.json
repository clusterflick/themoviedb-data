Through audiovisual accompaniment, complemented by the testimonies of its pupulation, we gain a deeper understanding of the tradition of honoring those who have departed this world. Santune, like memory, life and death, is not an individual experience; it is a communal celebration where tamales are shared, where everyone cleans and decorates the cemetery and sets up altars, awaiting the Ximawas, the green flies that physically represent the spirits of our loved ones.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SANTUNE (Todos Santos/Day of the Dead)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2728018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Ramos Luna","original_name":"Jorge Ramos Luna","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6993e94058ff550e7d287f2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6012588,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Juan M.
