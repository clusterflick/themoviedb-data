The first episode, \"The Scary Chimera Plan,\" pits them against a lunatic magician who intends to use Lina to create a fearsome, spell-slinging monster. Then, in \"Jeffry's Knighthood,\" they're hired by an overprotective mother to see that her son - a young man barely capable of holding a sword - becomes a respected knight, by \"helping\" him fight off the marauding soldiers terrorizing the area. Finally, \"Mirror, Mirror\" puts the two in a race to hunt down and capture (for bounty, of course) a rogue sorceror who's found an ancient artifact that can create loyal duplicates of anything or anyone, including his enemies.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/hZ1y1jcMnKmrpzU8WXKCmNfFZBX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Just when you think the situation is bad, it gets Inverse!","title":"Slayers Special OVA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Slayers: The Book of Spells","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Slayers Special: Book of Spells","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megumi Hayashibara","original_name":"林原めぐみ","popularity":2.0715,"profile_path":"/qiCiLNGaJmwql2uBpjnkY5zX5T2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lina Inverse (voice)","credit_id":"6993a249b37ca66b9d124bc3","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0161980","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"JP","iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/hZ1y1jcMnKmrpzU8WXKCmNfFZBX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2LSTXRDP784VYxgBIeIZen0TDH5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
