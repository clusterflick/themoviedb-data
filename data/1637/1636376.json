Only the stars in the heavens and in planetariums connect a man and a woman, traveling separately. Though they travel on parallel paths, they are destined to meet as the Sun must eventually embrace the Moon. The two characters seek to explore the mystique of space and the aesthetics of planetariums, as the physical heavens become their gateway to spiritual salvation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rxkV5r5MEpwZ5ano9VGlSEsvOKD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Germantown Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heavens Above","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6010334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Boisse-Kilgo","original_name":"Florence Boisse-Kilgo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (Voice)","credit_id":"69928f260889e168ad2af184","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6010337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Lee","original_name":"Marie Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"69928f617f884b8666fa34d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3292157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Schildknecht","original_name":"Ron Schildknecht","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Man","credit_id":"69928f6d0018f363521af02d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":59510,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marcel Cabrera","original_name":"Marcel Cabrera","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Friend","credit_id":"69928f49bdbfad0da19592f5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3292157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Schildknecht","original_name":"Ron Schildknecht","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69928f8f97e2811faf8504a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3292157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Schildknecht","original_name":"Ron Schildknecht","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69928fae7f884b8666fa34e3","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6010337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Lee","original_name":"Marie Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69928fc126ee3e1ae3fa3454","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3292157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Schildknecht","original_name":"Ron Schildknecht","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69928fd5b43d84eb821af23d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3292157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Schildknecht","original_name":"Ron Schildknecht","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69928fe36beb9e50626f6bf0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":59510,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marcel Cabrera","original_name":"Marcel Cabrera","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69928ff4cd92c228ca2af056","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6010344,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stephanie Gelfan","original_name":"Stephanie Gelfan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699290062a6e9e756c9591b3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5358124,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Schroeder","original_name":"John Schroeder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6992903448b7f960b82af0e5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5358124,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Schroeder","original_name":"John Schroeder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69929045ef35702faf95915b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5908939,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ellen Drinks","original_name":"Ellen Drinks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6992905201316c44ecfa347e","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1455634","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rxkV5r5MEpwZ5ano9VGlSEsvOKD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":524}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
