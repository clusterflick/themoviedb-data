The artistic itinerary and life of Giacomo Quarenghi, born in 1744 in Capiatone of Rota Imagna (Bergamo), a fistful of houses linked to the outside world by a narrow mule track. He was summoned to Russia, to the court of the Tsars, by Catherine II, a great admirer of Quarenghi. In St. Petersburg between the end of the 1700s and the start of the 1800s, a great number of palaces designed by him are built. He is a lonely man, despite the fevour of one of the most scintillating courts in Europe which surrounds him.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1994-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giacomo Quarenghi, Architetto a Pietroburgo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Cima","original_name":"Alberto Cima","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69935c7d11430905432af52a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Cima","original_name":"Alberto Cima","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69935c8576fc6c7ae26f70b6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Cima","original_name":"Alberto Cima","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69935c8e111535bdd9fa38c0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Cima","original_name":"Alberto Cima","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69935c967f884b8666fa3a71","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
