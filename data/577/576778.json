Starring as the photographer, football great Joe Namath narrates the unconventional tales of three couples: Judd Hirsch and Melinda Dillon as a twosome who have married and divorced multiple times and who are on the verge of repeating their mistake; an anxious newlywed who prefers the \"freedom\" that living together allows; and Jack Albertson as an aging comedian who wants to marry his much younger secretary despite the disapproval of his son.","popularity":2.2505,"poster_path":"/nRaTLVLyJKdSSZXo8fei0pK5vko.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":898,"logo_path":"/pBh5kde6mhGEMglYLwCdFnqK5zh.png","name":"Lorimar
