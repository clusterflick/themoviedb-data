She is shocked: only an addicted shadow of the former icon seems to be left. She decides to halt the obvious catastrophic decline of the once “most handsome man in the world”. As a consequence, this one-time god of the screen is suddenly sitting on my mother’s sofa in Nordsehl in Lower Saxony. And he stays put - for several months. While he trustingly rolls out his whole life before us, the dividing lines between film team, world star and family intermingle. This is a film about ageing, rising and falling - and about the fact that it is sometimes possible to regain an element of dignity in life.","popularity":0.2948,"poster_path":"/u958XyXoElNzOYogmWFLLaJop1f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33286,"logo_path":"/kT41nlPY9XUq5lq1QK6IAMhmT7n.png","name":"Kobalt
