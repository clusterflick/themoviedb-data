Closely following the compositions of Ray's original film, director Ann Oren presents printed frames from online videos in a stack directly below the cameraâ€”adding a single frame to the stack every few seconds. The unhurried process of stacking the images by hand slows the otherwise speedy consumption of pornographic media in a nod to Ray's preoccupation with the female body as sculpture.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vbc4oPixLerQYoNZEs5AhUiv49I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deux femmes (for Man Ray)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1834145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Oren","original_name":"Ann Oren","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c44f87e9251410e1f4d3ef2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6567912","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":993,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vbc4oPixLerQYoNZEs5AhUiv49I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":702}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2017-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
