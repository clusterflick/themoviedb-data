Since they last saw each other, Billy has gotten married. Homer is lamenting still being single and thinks that he will never find a woman who will want to be Mrs. Brown. Billy gets one of his old girlfriends, Peggy, a telephone operator, reluctantly to set Homer up with one of her friends. She chooses Jennie, a homebody of a woman who generally spends her evenings playing checkers with her father. Billy and Peggy accompany Homer and Jennie on their date, acting as their chaperons. Billy is able to maneuver Homer and Jennie into getting married that evening. Back at the hotel, a combination of changed hotel rooms, Jennie's angry father, Billy's jealous wife, and a confused hotel detective leads to misunderstandings and complications for all concerned.","popularity":0.6263,"poster_path":"/uxW2KLN85k81JOQasqeqDhSN3CM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mack Sennett Comedies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Unlucky Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Bevan","original_name":"Billy Bevan","popularity":0.2282,"profile_path":"/5yAbj9GLj7RfcMEFo3A20eOAIGU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Billy Trotter","credit_id":"5c43e7340e0a266d66d2531e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":945877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dot Farley","original_name":"Dot Farley","popularity":0.1282,"profile_path":"/sMOaVJca2FnFIRUs6L8zIuXAZnV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Trotter","credit_id":"5c43e7439251412bffdd0f98","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Dent","original_name":"Vernon Dent","popularity":0.1824,"profile_path":"/hIZai6jeEnoomMjlJm2bhHSQ15O.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Homer Brown","credit_id":"5c43e758c3a3681a0c23a70d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carole Lombard","original_name":"Carole Lombard","popularity":0.437,"profile_path":"/bPKG7DlExGyyl76A4OcGhO84P2L.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Peggy - Telephone Operator","credit_id":"5c43e763c3a3681a1123bb29","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":538924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmelita Geraghty","original_name":"Carmelita Geraghty","popularity":0.3482,"profile_path":"/f6TPMAjcb5dLcruNHXGFFpSHWhf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jenny - Homer's Girlfriend","credit_id":"5c43e770c3a3681a0323b0a6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William McCall","original_name":"William McCall","popularity":0.0824,"profile_path":"/iaOFaVebAeypz4cWNQYdjVHweAw.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hotel Manager","credit_id":"5c43e77ec3a36819fd23a7a5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Clyde","original_name":"Andy Clyde","popularity":0.2349,"profile_path":"/a2HSCnMfIpLnLCNr6r4gWM8zR6K.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Homer's Father-in-Law","credit_id":"5c43e78dc3a36819fd23a7c8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bud Jamison","original_name":"Bud Jamison","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":"/AiiqQpcsDraQqYxkKwwKHmCU0QE.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Hotel Detective","credit_id":"5c43e79c0e0a266d63d2414b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1092715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sunshine Hart","original_name":"Sunshine Hart","popularity":0.1175,"profile_path":"/nXNob9tq50z7yJCXvgbjpaaCxTx.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Hotel Manager's Wife","credit_id":"5c43e7ad0e0a266d6bd2579c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Art Rowlands","original_name":"Art Rowlands","popularity":0.1484,"profile_path":"/2ZV9ekvn4TbD1Jeauj8nAiVlICo.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Hotel Clerk","credit_id":"5c43e7bb0e0a266d66d25387","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":144023,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nicholas T.
