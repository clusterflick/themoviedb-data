Through purely abstract, moving images, the corresponding emotional states are conveyed: calm, love, joy, surprise, fear, anger/hate, and death/rebirth leading again to calm. The cycles continue until the stars burn out and there is nothing left. Minotaur was created stereoscopically in IMAXÂ® Sandde (Stereoscopic ANimation Drawing Device) , the world's first freehand stereoscopic 3D animation software.","popularity":0.1483,"poster_path":"/4h0eyYYMd7bysq1NG8oRm8eGxNn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minotaur","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035396,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Munro Ferguson","original_name":"Munro Ferguson","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c423a1f9251416b02b33e80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1674035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric San","original_name":"Eric San","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4b3f431684f70035700eb8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":46434,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marcy Page","original_name":"Marcy Page","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4b3f6beec4f30037d1e4ee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12458710","wikidata_id":"Q61968385","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rB7tDr99130IqpcIvy8n1D0MgBk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/di8IyDetdThF5jYK77Z5chBXKbv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4h0eyYYMd7bysq1NG8oRm8eGxNn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
