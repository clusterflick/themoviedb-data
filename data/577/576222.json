Miller, who died last year at 93, sat months before his passing for his final interview. He reminisced about living off rabbit stew and sleeping in a teardrop trailer in his endless pursuit of the perfect ski run and he explained in great detail the challenges - both personal and professional - he faced over the course of his career.","popularity":0.2095,"poster_path":"/6xZBg1vTTK7DP1syRAEvqto3m4O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warren Miller Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ski Bum: The Warren Miller Story","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Warren Miller","original_name":"Warren Miller","popularity":0.2734,"profile_path":"/apsffolz1ltiYEJBDkQYMLHgKOb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c42c39bc3a3687e94efea42","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Creadon","original_name":"Patrick Creadon","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":"/iQUrgMt8OaUpkFFuMBGasWqxNwp.jpg","credit_id":"5eb9c9f77d2bc1001d00dd35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9454068","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6xZBg1vTTK7DP1syRAEvqto3m4O.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1707},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":887,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nq7S6zF0v4cfadY7OY45mXHkED.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":591},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eL8XaG6xfwsq1EM06JdmRaBxjMx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Slamdance 2019","release_date":"2019-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
