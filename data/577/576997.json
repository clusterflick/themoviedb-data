Law enforcement agents can not deal independently with the investigation of this case. News of these acts quickly spread across the country - the arrival of the royal family in Moscow is in danger. It was then that a detective investigator Erast Petrovich Fandorin, who achieved certain professional successes in his business at such a young age, takes over the investigation. The provincial secretary of Aniasiy Tulips, for whom this business is a chance to prove himself in a favorable light, is taken to help Erast. The detectives are born an incredible and seemingly incredible version - Jack the Ripper visited Moscow, as bloody kisses were found on the girls' necks. The Ripper is also a personal threat to Fandorin, as the maniac is approaching his lover","popularity":0.2288,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21179,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinoslovo","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Decorator","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Dekorator","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Decorador","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":562730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danila Kozlovsky","original_name":"Данила Козловский","popularity":0.714,"profile_path":"/2lkPpwhMztEsDJ314Oifems0lrt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Erast Fandorin","credit_id":"5c46d4dc92514105c14d4f79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizaveta Boyarskaya","original_name":"Елизавета Боярская","popularity":0.6495,"profile_path":"/kqBXuDEeUfMqD8p0HkL1YcvZEM2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c46d4e49251415e344fccc2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Verzhbitskiy","original_name":"Виктор Вержбицкий","popularity":0.2684,"profile_path":"/yhPCWI6HHyHvTshfDNyuPloABet.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c46d4edc3a3684782854e70","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2117072,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kirill Zhurenkov","original_name":"Кирилл Журенков","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/5zIUD31Swuy9NMuD6xKDK2vxSno.jpg","credit_id":"5c46d5bcc3a368477a857d00","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265106,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Boris Akunin","original_name":"Борис Акунин","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":"/d3lXbnsas1twEaYByofNnzbhhG2.jpg","credit_id":"5c46d6190e0a264962c96dbb","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1761823,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Petr Anurov","original_name":"Пётр Ануров","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/s8HSX6At6ltVXrTSoOH8bZIQYw.jpg","credit_id":"5c46d5059251410e225073c7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2223631,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nadezhda Vorobyova","original_name":"Надежда Воробьева","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c46d5330e0a26495ac94748","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anton Bormatov","original_name":"Антон Борматов","popularity":0.0601,"profile_path":"/ctqIsZeZPPf3ljqo6NC4hKcRQvp.jpg","credit_id":"5c46d4f70e0a26494fc93e90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
