Worth, Texas soon becomes much more than they bargained for. Frustrated by the rising consumer-driven culture, out-of-work pals Douglass St. Clair Smith and Steve Wilcox decide to turn their conservative southern ideology on its head and invent a new religion all their own. Spurred on by the overreach of religion and zealous televangelists of the day, the pair concoct religious monikers (Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drummond), a newly minted prophet (J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs), and devise a crusade to expose the conspiracy of normalcy by using humor as the ultimate weapon.","popularity":1.0829,"poster_path":"/oZ83hw0ZilSTMzQuIblOmOEW9Vx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":254615,"logo_path":null,"name":"Production For Use","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J.R. “Bob” Dobbs and The Church of the SubGenius","video":false,"vote_average":5.333,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":978088,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Douglass Smith","original_name":"Douglass Smith","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Reverend Ivan Stang","credit_id":"5c8d6fd59251410ffc9f8cda","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2266528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Wilcox","original_name":"Steve Wilcox","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Philo Drummond","credit_id":"5c8d700ac3a368611c49bfc3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Offerman","original_name":"Nick Offerman","popularity":1.5458,"profile_path":"/zhmWZEJkzqgkIbSqZmFtUm0AwUV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c8d6f4ac3a368611f49d5e0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":564,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Linklater","original_name":"Richard Linklater","popularity":0.6824,"profile_path":"/xSctxeZQzQbZoaxIvcDeHlDjbiN.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c8d6f5b0e0a2612ed542e8e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penn Jillette","original_name":"Penn Jillette","popularity":0.7932,"profile_path":"/lxMpWaVKyeqZCxENRo1wu13iSTS.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c8d6f6d0e0a261304542f2a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald V.
