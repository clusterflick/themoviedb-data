Four years later, she became the object of scientific research that formed the bedrock of European ideas about BFS. She died the next year, but even after her death, Sara remained an object of imperialist scientific investigation. In the name of Science, her sexual organs and brain were preserved and displayed in the Musee de l'Homme in Paris until as recently as 1985. Using historical drawings, cartoons, legal documents, and interviews with noted cultural historians and anthropologists, this documentary deconstructs the social, political, scientific, and philosophical assumptions that transformed one young woman into a representation of savage sexuality and racial inferiority.","popularity":0.3436,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11244,"logo_path":"/gCHH1xt3dKjlm9NuMPF9ekpPWD6.png","name":"France 3","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":254715,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mail & Guardian Television","origin_country":""},{"id":19664,"logo_path":null,"name":"South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)","origin_country":""},{"id":93186,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dominant 7","origin_country":""},{"id":311,"logo_path":"/TNGvZ8zOklntjPP3EcsHtrR8Rc.png","name":"PROCIREP","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":851,"logo_path":"/kieSA3GFVysJcAUXNRer06u6e5x.png","name":"MEDIA Programme of the European Union","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1998-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life and Times of Sara Baartman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Life and Times of Sara Baartman: The Hottentot Venus","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zola Maseko","original_name":"Zola Maseko","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67bf80c9c5de842b4ba231c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2182290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Brown","original_name":"Adrian Brown","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67bf80d5c93271491f358a07","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5271587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hlengiwe Farasani","original_name":"Hlengiwe Farasani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67bf80eeb6c7e3425ca236a9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zola Maseko","original_name":"Zola Maseko","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6143667b85da1200629fa67b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5271585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Docin-Julien","original_name":"Christian Docin-Julien","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bf805ec029139b0e3586e9","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50081,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giulio Biccari","original_name":"Giulio Biccari","popularity":0.1258,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bf8076c5de842b4ba231a7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2011454,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karen Boswall","original_name":"Karen Boswall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bf808914a4396cafc8c0f0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2913287,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robin Harris","original_name":"Robin Harris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bf809ac029139b0e3586f8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171042,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lise Beaulieu","original_name":"Lise Beaulieu","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bf80afb6c7e3425ca2368c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1854736,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pops Mohamed","original_name":"Pops Mohamed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bf811614a4396cafc8c14e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0290726","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10983,"name":"anthropology"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":197758,"name":"female sexuality"},{"id":207928,"name":"19th century"},{"id":237188,"name":"ethnography"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"},{"id":242164,"name":"scientific research"},{"id":274542,"name":"1800s"},{"id":291081,"name":"black woman"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"},{"id":321490,"name":"historical documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
