When Sherwin dies shortly thereafter, he leaves his daughter Betty in the care of John Kenwood and his sister, Constance, who allows Betty to believe she has an income, sending her to boarding school while they surreptitiously go to work to support her. Upon her return home Fleming pursues her but she rejects him, and he tells her the mine is worthless. However, a dream leads her to believe otherwise and after much travail she discovers the truth as well as Fleming’s duplicity. John declares his long-hidden love for her, and they are wed.","popularity":0.2864,"poster_path":"/5kZ24LqcQBBxJOOLgBJ77i3039V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29749,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jesse L.
