Growing up on the streets he is taken under the wing of safecracker James Carleton, who arranges for the kid to have a decent home and a good education. In time Sonny becomes a football hero at college, meeting and falling in love with Mary Kayne. When a nasty detective reveals to the girl that her sweetheart is the \"foster son\" of a notorious crook, Mary declares that she doesn't care and intends to love the hero to the end of her days. But there's still one obstacle to overcome when it turns out that Grey's own father may well be the no-good slug who gave the boy his permanent birthmark.","popularity":0.144,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":245853,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sun Motion Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heartless Husbands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John T.
