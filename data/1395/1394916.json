Soon, Lee wins the affections of Coralie Grayson, whom Max had long wished to marry. On the night before Coralie and Lee's wedding, Max discovers his brother's crime, but for Coralie's sake arranges to repay the stolen money. Max is too late, however, because Lee has stolen again. Coralie learns of her husband's true nature after the wedding. On their honeymoon cruise, they accidentally meet Max, who is traveling on the same boat. As the days pass, Lee becomes more depraved until, in a jealous pique, he shoots Max. Max, wounded, crawls to his brother's room, and Lee, confronted by his victim, dies of shock, thus freeing Max and Coralie to begin a new life together.
