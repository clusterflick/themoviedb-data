This creative documentary intertwines Canadian history, indigeneity, colonial legacies, feminisms, and sport. Shot over the period of several years (2009-2015), Kwanxwala-Thunder constructs a portrait of Alert Bay through soccer. The film's impressionistic approach takes us through the incorporation of soccer into Kwakwaka'wakw culture despite its colonial arrival on the island while highlighting multiple generations of female soccer players.","popularity":0.1101,"poster_path":"/vNgCIyBbWBHLYtnUxOo2xdRpIEw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kwanxwala - Thunder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5087570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Shamash","original_name":"Sarah Shamash","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6748776b2ed39a3af171e3f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5087570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Shamash","original_name":"Sarah Shamash","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67487773d43b4d11cd4bdaf9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5087570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Shamash","original_name":"Sarah Shamash","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6748777f2ed39a3af171e3ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5087570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Shamash","original_name":"Sarah Shamash","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6748778ad43b4d11cd4bdb03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inaamulhaq","original_name":"Inaamulhaq","popularity":0.2019,"profile_path":"/uDxMy901mwdamRdNnQft36Q8Xi.jpg","credit_id":"6748779e1d0b5b3fb833fc9a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1985215,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Russell Wallace","original_name":"Russell Wallace","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674877aa8bb84ab808cf98cd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/doXTYPXib5W5FhJrlaw2jGU6JQI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vNgCIyBbWBHLYtnUxOo2xdRpIEw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":712}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
