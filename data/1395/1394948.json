John fritters away his time playing the horses rather than paying attention to his job on Wall Street. He pays dearly for this when the market goes wrong, and he is wiped out. Coincidentally an old friend, Sir Harry, arrives bringing the news of a vast fortune left Betty and she is now Lady Betty. Betty keeps the news a secret from John, who has taken up with a Mrs. Airlie. But as John comes to believe Betty has become involved with Sir Harry, his jealousy is awoken, and he acts rashly until explanations all around straighten everything out.","popularity":0.1692,"poster_path":"/iPvUecKTazsVMfGtkjRRXSAi5eT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29749,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jesse L.
