The goal: to cross a large swath of Quebec to work towards reconciliation between peoples.  In this choral film, which is as much a physical ordeal as a spiritual and psychological one, the participants take on the mission of raising public awareness of the issues dear to their communities. Through the challenges posed by the weather and the long daily journeys that put the group to the test, a powerful bond is forged between the participants, who face enormous adversity.  A journey on the land of ancestors that reveals the strength of togetherness.","popularity":0.3821,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":104613,"logo_path":"/oQFsGgUZK1C5Lk5FXtQevYKHqSu.png","name":"Terre Innue","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3500 km de sentiers partagés","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1979715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim O'Bomsawin","original_name":"Kim O'Bomsawin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1XpngtObJiZv0rM08bBU3HkiSOx.jpg","credit_id":"6748843c1d0b5b3fb833fde2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2299429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Gros-Louis","original_name":"Brad Gros-Louis","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/xaj0aj9ZyjV8ukfmm6RqUc0iI2W.jpg","credit_id":"674884431d0b5b3fb833fde5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1979715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim O'Bomsawin","original_name":"Kim O'Bomsawin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1XpngtObJiZv0rM08bBU3HkiSOx.jpg","credit_id":"6748845194215dcd6d6bb510","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426122,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrea Henriquez","original_name":"Andrea Henriquez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67489dd11d0b5b3fb834004b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2228372,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hugo Gendron","original_name":"Hugo Gendron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67489de4446b8badda2f373c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5087726,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Louis-Philippe Michaud","original_name":"Louis-Philippe Michaud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67489dfe2aa5b7bd14e54789","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2859453,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandre Bacon","original_name":"Alexandre Bacon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4JgXBMtuwjPij3duy54u6jzKJll.jpg","credit_id":"67489e0d446b8badda2f376d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1979715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim O'Bomsawin","original_name":"Kim O'Bomsawin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1XpngtObJiZv0rM08bBU3HkiSOx.jpg","credit_id":"67489e185434388e1a58ac10","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florent Vollant","original_name":"Florent Vollant","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/4CxdkPjopLwSwUzRvsy2OidLrwk.jpg","credit_id":"67489e22446b8badda2f3774","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r7BMIVB4hBhBEuMcGDrWAm06Bu3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":1963,"name":"expedition"},{"id":163976,"name":"reconciliation"},{"id":207771,"name":"snowmobile"},{"id":224325,"name":"rallying"},{"id":343024,"name":"non-indigenous"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
