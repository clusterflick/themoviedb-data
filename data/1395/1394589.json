The uncanny atmosphere of summer noon in Ermoupolis. The film is a fusion of fiction and documentary, essay and performance. It develops the theme of Grandiva but also records the process of teaching film to young performers during the Summer Academy of the National Theatre of Greece. The narrative units of the film are simultaneously exercises on film acting, as well as live performances that took place in the urban space of Ermoupolis, on the Greek island of Syros, in the summer of 2006.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noon Hour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoinetta Angelidi","original_name":"Antouanetta Angelidi","popularity":0.1235,"profile_path":"/k1QensA4ZlxSvY33Sx5JZozt9rZ.jpg","credit_id":"6747a895494ca553b2373434","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1365802,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rea Wallden","original_name":"Rea Wallden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747a8a9c8ad1f24e4eb0789","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1365802,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rea Wallden","original_name":"Rea Wallden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747a8c0494ca553b237344b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoinetta Angelidi","original_name":"Antouanetta Angelidi","popularity":0.1235,"profile_path":"/k1QensA4ZlxSvY33Sx5JZozt9rZ.jpg","credit_id":"6747a8e9c8ad1f24e4eb07af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1365802,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rea Wallden","original_name":"Rea Wallden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747a8f4c85a4506b12ef66f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
