The film reflects the dramatic change from the perspective of those who have to shoulder the task of \"national and alliance defense\" in a very concrete and personal way in their everyday lives, at their location, in their unit.","popularity":0.2174,"poster_path":"/2EqIdLNNnKHFttoijftA29n6VMD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turning Point Up Close -
