Mountains Not for Profit, a short documentary by Teton Gravity Research in collaboration with the Indy Pass, dives into the stories of four non-profit ski areas that have flipped the script on corporate-driven snow culture. Shames Mountain (BC), Whaleback (NH), Black Mountain of Maine, and Antelope Butte (WY) are proof that passion, grit, and community can keep the soul of skiing alive. These mountains thrive on volunteer effort, donations, and the sheer joy of carving turns. This is grassroots skiing at its finestâ€”where people and purpose drive the powder days.","popularity":0.1437,"poster_path":"/bAscD8YSUlgWpKff4l9z8OTv3VG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11117,"logo_path":"/vkZJsXBKKfHZVLMDxuMktZXNmyA.png","name":"Teton Gravity Research","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The resurgent story of community - empowered by ski and snowboard areas","title":"Mountains Not For Profit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Dybvig","original_name":"Evan Dybvig","popularity":0.0824,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self / Co-Owner, Whaleback Mountain","credit_id":"6747f443a65145f558daf373","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5087002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaylene Tomez","original_name":"Kaylene Tomez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self / Owner, Unbound Apparel & Gear","credit_id":"6747f54f0790bffd777695f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5087004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Zeerip","original_name":"Brad Zeerip","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self / Shames Mountain Local","credit_id":"6747f60510946c29c6029d15","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5087008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Bell","original_name":"Cameron Bell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self / Ski School Director, Shames Mountain","credit_id":"6747f7352aa5b7bd14e5339e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908233,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Drew Holt","original_name":"Drew Holt","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747f2102f43b150b9b08286","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908233,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Drew Holt","original_name":"Drew Holt","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747f21b379b03a9f1d05721","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219977,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Boucher","original_name":"Andrew Boucher","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747f22f2ed39a3af171d333","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5086988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Mogensen","original_name":"Eric Mogensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747f2592f43b150b9b082a9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3363842,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Doug Fish","original_name":"Doug Fish","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747f2682ed39a3af171d352","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74455,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Jones","original_name":"Steve Jones","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747f27e379b03a9f1d0575d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2161484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Todd Jones","original_name":"Todd Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747f29a2aa5b7bd14e53312","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908233,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Drew Holt","original_name":"Drew Holt","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747f2a72aa5b7bd14e53317","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2961846,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jon Riley","original_name":"Jon Riley","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747f2c08bb84ab808cf8c0d","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gx5vtMKqVWpEwotIvxOpcEcCbpl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bAscD8YSUlgWpKff4l9z8OTv3VG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MOUNTAINS NOT FOR PROFIT - OFFICIAL FILM","key":"1VbO4ZXTM4o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":true,"published_at":"2024-11-26T18:00:53.000Z","id":"6747f3082a5622b105717090"}]}}}
