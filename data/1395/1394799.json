La reinvención de la Pampa","overview":"The architecture of Argentinian architect Francisco Salamone has been compared to the film sets of Metropolis: eccentric and with a heightened sense of drama. Salamone's activities under his country's fascist regimes has cast a shadow on his vast body of work, but the unique architecture of this colourfull Argentinian architect is gradually being rediscovered. A fascinating road movie through the vast pampas of Argentina.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7ibuz0S1lhVZcUQlWhMmRiilGvJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mundo Salamone.
