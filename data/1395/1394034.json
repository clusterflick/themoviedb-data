In January 2020, New York-based, interdisciplinary performing artist Eiko Otake arrived in Beijing to visit Wen Hui, a Chinese choreographer and filmmaker. Eight years apart, Eiko grew up in postwar Japan and Wen, during the Cultural Revolution in China. They planned to visit each other for a month to converse and collaborate. The surge of COVID-19 abruptly cut off Eiko’s visit and the pandemic made Wen’s visit to the USA impossible, but not the collaboration. Looking back on the video diaries they shot without a script, Eiko and Wen continued their dialogue on Zoom, sharing past works that form a deeper understanding of their circumstantial differences and characteristic similarities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Rule is Our Rule","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2279028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wen Hui","original_name":"Wen Hui","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67463a20da767aae3040b1f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3445347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiko Otake","original_name":"Eiko Otake","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67463a2ada767aae3040b203","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2279028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wen Hui","original_name":"Wen Hui","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67463a46da767aae3040b223","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3445347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiko Otake","original_name":"Eiko Otake","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67463a4e95c55a2027178ae9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
