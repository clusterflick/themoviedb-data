The film focuses on the poem's original inspiration, a 19th century Japanese woodblock print entitled People on a Bridge by Hiroshige Utagawa. Six figures are caught in the middle of an old wooden bridge during a sudden rainstorm. As the people run to seek shelter, the drama of this moment in time is captured in the poetry as both frozen and infinitely fluid.","popularity":0.2415,"poster_path":"/41GD8BSUqEHvwWce6cQbpQWWZop.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An experimental film based on a poem by Wisława Szymborska.","title":"People on the Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5086130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rylan Pozniak Daniels","original_name":"Rylan Pozniak Daniels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Clock Eyes","credit_id":"6747694e66b9a4f93c84e032","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":156310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beata Pozniak","original_name":"Beata Pozniak","popularity":0.1251,"profile_path":"/nQjhHQYYSfuCAtzrkqbpxIPLDBb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Poet","credit_id":"6747695d66b9a4f93c84e03a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":156310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beata Pozniak","original_name":"Beata Pozniak","popularity":0.1251,"profile_path":"/nQjhHQYYSfuCAtzrkqbpxIPLDBb.jpg","credit_id":"6747686ed2818121221dc37c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":156310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beata Pozniak","original_name":"Beata Pozniak","popularity":0.1251,"profile_path":"/nQjhHQYYSfuCAtzrkqbpxIPLDBb.jpg","credit_id":"6747688266b9a4f93c84dfc4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3361115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wisława Szymborska","original_name":"Wisława Szymborska","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674768fd95c55a202717b054","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3133665,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andreas Kossak","original_name":"Andreas Kossak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747698166b9a4f93c84e056","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3021820","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2237,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/41GD8BSUqEHvwWce6cQbpQWWZop.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1491}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
