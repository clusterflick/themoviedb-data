The sound of footsteps ascending the stairs and the murmur of a small crowd fill the air, but the stairs are empty. This \"phantom sound\" creates an atmosphere of mystery and absence, reflecting the invisibility and silence forced by censorship. The subtle sound of the projection machine mixes with some voices that tell of the many creative ways that the film society found to circumvent censorship during the PIDE era. Among the many cinephile memories there are reports of the cultural resistance of the film club.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6AvRSYKjEGYhY7x1Mva8NJlhgCH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2024-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Porta de Expressão","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Expression Door","type":"English"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5087578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulo Cunha","original_name":"Paulo Cunha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Paulo Cunha","credit_id":"674878b68454c6ca363658a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5117313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Mesquita","original_name":"Carlos Mesquita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Carlos Mesquita","credit_id":"675c765e73e957a01a87be8a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5117316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomás Taveira","original_name":"Tomás Taveira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cztFHiEleLxpe0ZxGWc13mV0E5X.jpg","credit_id":"675c76a8018dc8e7bbd16433","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5117317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diogo Coutinho","original_name":"Diogo Coutinho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675c76bb69a10f54a55a1945","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5117319,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bruno Santos","original_name":"Bruno Santos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675c76d49046f73f3af190b2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5117316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomás Taveira","original_name":"Tomás Taveira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cztFHiEleLxpe0ZxGWc13mV0E5X.jpg","credit_id":"675c770873e957a01a87bf26","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5117317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diogo Coutinho","original_name":"Diogo Coutinho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675c7718018dc8e7bbd16494","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5117319,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bruno Santos","original_name":"Bruno Santos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675c77369046f73f3af190b7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5117316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomás Taveira","original_name":"Tomás Taveira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cztFHiEleLxpe0ZxGWc13mV0E5X.jpg","credit_id":"675c774d69a10f54a55a197c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5117316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomás Taveira","original_name":"Tomás Taveira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cztFHiEleLxpe0ZxGWc13mV0E5X.jpg","credit_id":"675c777ee269c682230fdd72","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":765,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/65NokiKz2Pal3xNqHjQMo4kf82S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1360}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/6AvRSYKjEGYhY7x1Mva8NJlhgCH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Revoluções Curtas","release_date":"2024-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
