Blackberry painting","overview":"Inde Est is the title of the artistic contribution presented by cinema critic and situationist theorist Enrico Ghezzi at the ancient Church of San Ludovico in Venice for the third Internet Pavilion: The Unconnected (2013). Inspired by the Latin phrase fugit hora, hoc quod loquor inde est [time flees, and what I am saying already belongs to it] from Persius’s fifth Satire, Ghezzi’s durational performance consisted in a 8-hour mute speech that evoked the out-of-sync effect typical of his monologues for Fuori Orario [after hours], a radical overnight broadcast on avant-garde cinema airing on the Italian national TV since 1988. Miltos Manetas celebrates this cult figure of Italian television, filming him within the space of the Internet Pavilion. His portrait takes the form of a BlackBerry Painting, a simultaneous act of recording and painting that has accompanied Manetas’s practice since his early use of smartphones.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inde Est.
