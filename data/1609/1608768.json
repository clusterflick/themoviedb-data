The video centers on a metanarrative that weaves together different spatial and temporal planes and various linguistic elements: materials drawn from the historical archive of Istituto Luce–Italy’s state-owned film company–and from the artist’s own private archive, recounted and interpreted by two voices and two intelligences. One artificial and one emotional. Cinema Impero is a black box, a device that encompasses cinematic, theatrical, and algorithmic languages. The work was originally presented as part a performance conceived for one viewer at a time. Placed at the center of historical macro-narrative, the individual spectator was confronted with a space of warm proximity to the artist, an intimate space of otherness shared between narrator and listener.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinema Impero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
