Name: Heavy Weapons Guy  Role: Defense  Weapons: Chain Gun / Shotgun / Giant Fists  Like a hibernating bear, the Heavy appears to be a gentle giant. Also like a bear, confusing his deliberate, sleepy demeanor with gentleness will get you ripped limb from limb. Though he speaks simply and moves with an economy of energy that's often confused with napping, the Heavy isn't dumb, he's not your big friend, and he generally wishes you'd just shut up before he has to make you shut up.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/c81Zli05KPWGMWRMJRcyN44jtLu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":285094,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Valve Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Team Fortress 2","title":"Meet the Heavy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5465626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Walker","original_name":"Robin Walker","popularity":0.223,"profile_path":"/dYs83VTLJrVo1iuN0tQ7ypoDfi2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Director","credit_id":"69588d5eaee9f647a474fe1e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5465629,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erik Wolpaw","original_name":"Erik Wolpaw","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/7aYmX8n8JJhJKfEcnj7kdhOhpD3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Writer","credit_id":"69588d953251db027ac37cc7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":184330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Schwartz","original_name":"Gary Schwartz","popularity":0.6186,"profile_path":"/gNB9tZ7UDLWJFHWHLSqx8hPS9h3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Heavy","credit_id":"69588dc25e7068066cd7978d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5465626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Walker","original_name":"Robin Walker","popularity":0.223,"profile_path":"/dYs83VTLJrVo1iuN0tQ7ypoDfi2.jpg","credit_id":"69588e1b644be6ca7dd797ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5465629,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erik Wolpaw","original_name":"Erik Wolpaw","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/7aYmX8n8JJhJKfEcnj7kdhOhpD3.jpg","credit_id":"69588e2b90b1567a4bc39665","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5465636,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mike Morasky","original_name":"Mike Morasky","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695893bde232373c0dc39980","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.783,"height":1328,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jLjPK55To6VtRheOKrfAM1gShey.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2368}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c81Zli05KPWGMWRMJRcyN44jtLu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/58rEgCoeBj3ZTr4iQjW0viVyRz9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":325376,"name":"origin"},{"id":364668,"name":"short films"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
