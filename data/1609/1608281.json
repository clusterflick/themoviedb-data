Though their sons-Pratap, Manohar, and Sharad-are well settled and caring, Bhau and Mai struggle to adjust to city life, longing for their village home and fields. Meanwhile, Kundan and Tara, siblings displaced by floods in Uttar Pradesh, arrive in Mumbai seeking work. After much hardship, Kundan finds employment at Pratap's catering business. During Ganeshotsav, Bhau and Mai return to their village, and Kundan and Tara accompany them to assist. In the absence of their city-settled children, the siblings fill an emotional void, forming a deep bond with the couple.  When Kundan and Tara must return to their own village to claim flood compensation, Bhau and Mai are left alone once more. Bhau later passes away, and aging forces Mai to move permanently to Mumbai. The village home and fields fall silent.","popularity":0.1214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2026-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Gaman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5912051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manoj Naiksatam","original_name":"Manoj Naiksatam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6957905fe109b30a803bd6ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pune International Film Festival","release_date":"2026-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
