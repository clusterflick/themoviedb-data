He works at a warehouse that sponsors his visa while he pursues his passion for art in the face of family demands for him to return home while Rin patiently weathers overbearing colleagues and her own family’s expectations over her settling down. Through these two characters, on the verge of parting due to the demands of others, the film explores the limits of personal freedom and desire.
