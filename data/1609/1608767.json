Speaking about Youth Youth Youth, the artist explains: “When I was 10 years old, my father told me that his best friend as a young man had committed suicide wearing a suit, so that his parents would not have to pay for the funeral services to dress the body. From that day on, my idea of dressing up changed forever. I’ve had these images in my head for a long time and they eventually became a little film on loop. My intention was to create spokesperson images for everyone and make my loves and friends immortal”.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Youth Youth Youth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
