Drawing inspiration from the hypnotic spiral movements that have long defined Apollonio’s practice—particularly her lacquered wood pieces, Fusione Circolare (2016) and Fusione Circolare Doppia (2019)—the video depicts a spinning vinyl record that embodies the dialogue between the two artists. The image captures the rhythmic expansion and contraction of black and white lines. Meanwhile, a fluorescent yellow turntable stylus, labelled Nightclub, traces the record groove from start to finish.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endings: Nightclub","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
