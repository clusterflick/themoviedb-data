What begins in urgency and desire slowly fractures. Time intrudes. Ambition shifts. Affection turns conditional. What once felt infinite begins to bruise and break. Seven years later, beneath the shadow of Mount Fuji, they meet again. Japan is quieter. The air is thinner.  They are no longer who they were. Carrying different lives, different scars, they stand face to face with a past that never truly left them.  Can love survive its own history or does it merely haunt those who try to return to it? Toh, Ti Ani Fuji is an intimate, visually driven meditation on love, memory and the fragile, devastating hope of second chances.","popularity":0.15,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2026-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Toh Ti Ani Fuji","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085906,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mohit Takalkar","original_name":"Mohit Takalkar","popularity":0.2262,"profile_path":"/yVTTQPU8SURdRupsbQiZnVXZaKS.jpg","credit_id":"69578e23daa832d5c5d7ad86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pune International Film Festival","release_date":"2026-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
