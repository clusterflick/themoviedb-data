The film shows little more than the sky’s luminance changing, guided by the lights that, in the buildings being gazed at, turn on and off as time goes by. This image portrays Burj Khalifa–a decoy built to attract everyone from everywhere. Invernomuto’s film, EMPIRE 2020, is a remake of Andy Warhol’s 1965 film EMPIRE. Warhol, with the help of John Palmer, Jonas Mekas and others, framed the top of the Empire State Building, from another building, and filmed it uninterruptedly, for six and a half hours. Both Warhol and now the Italian duo eventually slowed down their footage so the films would get to their final length of eight hours and five minutes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":485,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Empire 2020","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
