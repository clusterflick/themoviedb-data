The video unfolds as an uninterrupted loop depicting a descent and subsequent ascent through the entrails of a celestial body, tracing a potential space–time journey between the Earth and the subterranean passages of another planet.  In Never Ground, authentic ecosystems are seamlessly integrated with meticulously constructed studio settings, evoking the special effects techniques employed in pre-digital science fiction cinema—such as the use of miniatures sets and props.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Never Ground","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
