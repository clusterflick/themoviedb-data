Filmed after Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me and directed by David Lynch, they feature a sequential story in four parts with Dale Cooper as the main character. Angelo Badalamenti's music was used in the ads, specifically the title theme, \"Dance of the Dream Man,\" and \"Audrey's Dance.\" Despite being aimed at a Japanese audience, most of the dialogue is in English, with the exception of a few Japanese lines by the characters Ken (Taka Higuchi) and Asami.  Originally a second series of four were planned, but the Georgie Coffee company, unhappy with the first series, canceled them.  They were later released in the 2007 DVD box set, Twin Peaks: Definitive Gold Box Edition.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"short; commercials","title":"Georgia Coffee commercials","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
