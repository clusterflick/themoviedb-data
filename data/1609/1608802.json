Central scene, in which he convinces a woman to come with him, takes place in a Finnish rockabilly club. The Hitchcockian pacing, as the man endeavours to make his train, supplies nice momentum, and wrap-up provides a satisfying revelation as to what’s actually afoot.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9QbJ6FgqAjRBIBwFn6nupNG84Lw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":706,"logo_path":"/sFx1ev5v65J38r3JyHkkHtXrOrI.png","name":"Sputnik","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":168350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Road
