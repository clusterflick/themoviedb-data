Within weeks, Taylor is riding Riley's horses to a string of victories. Success and the limelight go right to the jockey's head. Big-time gambler Tom Drake hires a blonde sexpot to seduce Tod and introduce him to the roulette wheel. Showing off, he starts playing for stakes way over his head. With Drake holding a huge note that Tod can't possibly pay off, he delivers an ultimatum â€” lose the big race tomorrow or a police detective will be waiting at the finish line to arrest him for passing bad checks.","popularity":0.6092,"poster_path":"/xHutGZDgqMwFwKCcgkoMN92Rx9K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tiffany
