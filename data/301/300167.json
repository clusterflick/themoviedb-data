The texture of flesh, the ambiguity of longing and the colors of psychedelic apotheosis all merge into a languorous ecstasy which Lloyd Williams is adept in translating into the medium of film. All the varieties of film technique: slow motion, multiple-exposure, fast motion, camera in full flight and frozen image, he uses for the revelation of his intense fantasy, whether from dreams or from real-life or from hallucinated contemplation. His work shows that the dreamer is, indeed, awakening into a whole new world of erotic fantasy, muted with desire. If hard core films shock you, the films of Lloyd Williams will caress you.\" –Charles Boultenhouse","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/xcZbqDrIKRzwuuBZ3M3ZkAeXCEW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rainbow's Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":72403,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Suzanne Ciani","original_name":"Suzanne Ciani","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":"/obxXVE0BIGMchXjTWWFrkemgDxd.jpg","credit_id":"545359f10e0a2648c2000ec9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lloyd Michael Williams","original_name":"Lloyd Michael Williams","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/cgYRyP0msdqIl9kqioTi26ggGOE.jpg","credit_id":"59632709c3a3680dec0c5116","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0363010","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":902,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xcZbqDrIKRzwuuBZ3M3ZkAeXCEW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":652}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
