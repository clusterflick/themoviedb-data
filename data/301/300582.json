Alan plays with the camera and enjoys the friendship of filmmaker Losier, while also loving, fighting and living with his family (Liz Lamere, his wife and collaborator, and their son Dante, young replica of Alan). Traces of joy, eccentricity, illumination but also deep fatigue and slow Suicide. The rock-n-roll Alan is still very alive, funny and rebellious.","popularity":0.0809,"poster_path":"/n0ARVG4UWMCFYeJMO0Dqw9LX9SF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alan Vega: Just a Million Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Vega","original_name":"Alan Vega","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/5JM3K3wqAE1o22QMVWwqXSBkUQP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5456eab20e0a2648c2008668","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1038015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Losier","original_name":"Marie Losier","popularity":0.2863,"profile_path":"/4dwd7fUTjHyPZJ9eDZmxVfrdUlI.jpg","credit_id":"5456ea9d0e0a261ad100199a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4022250","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n0ARVG4UWMCFYeJMO0Dqw9LX9SF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
