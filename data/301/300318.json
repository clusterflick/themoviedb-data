It is a witty spoof about a ghost and the 'haunted' mansion where a rich American family start to live. In this story, the family are not annoyed by the presence of the ghost; no, it is the ghost who is annoyed by the family who just refuse to be terrified. After all, why should we be scared by an old man wearing rusty coat of mail, whose best trick is to walk in the middle of night making big noises?","popularity":1.7843,"poster_path":"/3GPu2q3qbyTAQboSPl1CN2dswt0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40601,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tetra
