Smith) seems like a golden opportunity at first glance: an opportunity that quickly spirals into something much more harrowing.  Desperate to breathe new life into a failing movie he's producing, Wes approaches Ron for assistance with his dying film. Ron agrees in exchange for Wes's help with a little known project of his own.  While attempting to honor his end of their deal, Wes discovers that Ron is really a depraved cop with sinister motives. Both men are willing to do whatever it takes to win a game of cat and mouse that leads to Wes's ever increasing struggle to protect his family.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1482179","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
