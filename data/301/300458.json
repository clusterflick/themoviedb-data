For the past 30 years he has been living on his own in snow caves in the Norwegian mountains. Always on the move, using a pair of old wooden skis, he goes from one snow cave to the next in search of shelter from extreme blizzards and bitingly cold wind. A true expert in outdoor survival techniques, this wilderness man refuses to be reigned in by modern society. Instead he has chosen a way of life that flies in the face of conformist consumer culture and the materialistic modern world. Sverre's life is a tale about the quest for total freedom as well as the price one pays in seeking it.","popularity":0.0802,"poster_path":"/up6sobCY4SoiLGINIlHYcgzu3ep.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Snow Cave Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1958024","wikidata_id":"Q17504883","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/up6sobCY4SoiLGINIlHYcgzu3ep.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1120}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
