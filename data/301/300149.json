His demands are met with a positive rebuff, and when he becomes insistent be is forcibly ejected by Galora. As he leaves the tenement he vows to get even, and lies in wait until Galora has gone out on business. Climbing to the fifth floor, on which the Galoras live, he watches his chance, which comes when Mrs. Galora goes for an instant to visit a neighbor on the same floor. Darting into the apartment and raising the window he perceives the awful result of a drop to the ground, five stories below, and so evolves a plan that is dastardly in the extreme. Taking the infant child from the cradle, and placing it in a basket he lets it out with a short rope, the end of which he secures by letting the sash down on it, so that to raise the window would precipitate the baby to destruction.","popularity":0.2939,"poster_path":"/fmk6STw5AqckvLaLgT3aVWm3Pe1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1909-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cord of Life","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Inslee","original_name":"Charles Inslee","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":"/adYzNqmBzmfGkFppoc8eHn2EHk5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Galora","credit_id":"5453132f0e0a2648c2000590","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Leonard","original_name":"Marion Leonard","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/ftSUgK4P92cPUOMGl3LLeFbdBan.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Galora's Wife","credit_id":"5453133cc3a3681480000597","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Gebhardt","original_name":"George Gebhardt","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/yUsuLBxrWP6wO152fkS8ssHTmIg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Antonine","credit_id":"54531348c3a368148d00059c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Arvidson","original_name":"Linda Arvidson","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/pxNBQP2W90PyV69sjH3CRvXL2O4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"In Tenement","credit_id":"54531354c3a368148000059c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1171949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Bernard","original_name":"Dorothy Bernard","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/Aw51i2Azw2IICVyS8zpZE0VqFf6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5453135fc3a3681473000585","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":128163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara T.
