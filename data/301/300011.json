Of course that's easy for these three veterans of comedy since their first language is English. Filmed at the El Portal Theater the 3 Non Juans talk about the joys and perils of living in a Spanish speaking culture without speaking a word of Spanish and making a living doing it in a not so brown world, all stereo types welcome. This show is definitely for the Spanish Impaired...IT'S IN ENGLISH PEOPLE!","popularity":0.2707,"poster_path":"/z7XwaWTIAaX6w6lIutjI3QqSKWx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 Non Juans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Alazraqui","original_name":"Carlos Alazraqui","popularity":1.4408,"profile_path":"/d2hufnjlfsZiY7N9NLZ6b7FE1IZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6344281ecdf2e6007ad1eb80","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Madrigal","original_name":"Al Madrigal","popularity":0.4909,"profile_path":"/p4vN80EGGlzLb5J7G8Ss3n9K2pc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6344284fb7a154007cc7061f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny A.
