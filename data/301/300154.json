Learning of the impending peril, Helen dashes to a water tower under which the train must pass, climbs out on the spout, leaps onto the roof of one of the cars, and warns the engineer in time. Helen's heroism wins her another offer of marriage, this time from Wadsworth, the freight engineer, but once again she opts for next weeks hazards instead.","popularity":0.165,"poster_path":"/nC2aTVDLoHG1JBHevxn6HmSssbY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalem Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Leap from the Water Tower","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Hazards of Helen (#9): The Leap from the Water Tower","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1072383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Holmes","original_name":"Helen Holmes","popularity":0.1313,"profile_path":"/nautzlUkBuQv5VJLL6ZjdKwNpy4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Helen","credit_id":"545322de0e0a2648cf000781","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo D.
