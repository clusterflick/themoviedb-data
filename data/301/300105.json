This is a film about historic events that shape history. It is a film about courage and fear; ignorance and knowledge; propaganda and rhetoric. Through original footage, archived footage, and interviews with people such as Howard Zinn, Michael Parenti, and Michael Ruppert, Liberty Bound explores the state of the union and its ostensible move toward fascism. We talk with people who have been interrogated by the Secret Service and threatened with arrest for doing such benign things as sending an email, turning around during a Bush speech, and having a philosophical discussion on a train.","popularity":0.1899,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liberty Bound","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Parenti","original_name":"Michael Parenti","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":"/10VJ0mSCftaO9NGVhrOneLra9j9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"60c4012ce24e3a006f03c825","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Zinn","original_name":"Howard Zinn","popularity":0.121,"profile_path":"/8ahVDi6PuHH4bfadaHWYOzpYGHU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"6140abf79450fe008ec79032","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Ruppert","original_name":"Michael Ruppert","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"6140ae23aaf8970062bde70b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3121985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Rose","original_name":"Christine Rose","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/k2xabqvt2QllUMcm3L5GyxD0ReQ.jpg","credit_id":"60c400d6aaf89700415d86c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0407945","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
