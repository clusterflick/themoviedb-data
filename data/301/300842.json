As is the case with the former American Idol co-host who left the Idol series after just the first season. \"I just thought they where mean to the contestants... well I did.\" We think he made the right choice because Brian is one of the funniest comedians working today proving hands down and once and for all that comedy is a skill earned. Brian takes us through his life post Idol in a humorous and self-deprecating way that is both hilarious and endearing.","popularity":0.1312,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brian Dunkleman: American Dunkleman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Dunkleman","original_name":"Brian Dunkleman","popularity":0.178,"profile_path":"/yfJlYaGRvGia3ilNn6EspIBNQ0f.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664154b15619989fb7e535a1","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2153216","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
