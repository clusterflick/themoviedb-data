An encounter with Jason, his bully from high school, triggers a painful and disturbing past: an abusive, alcoholic father; his mother who committed suicide; and Todd, his older brother who's up for parole. Inspired by the goth drag queen Eve who performs at Midnight Cabaret, Adam decides to change overnight from geek to chic. He then is befriended by a few troublemakers who introduce him to a wild lifestyle of drugs and crime, sending him into a downward spiral and an unexpected journey in finding who he truly is.","popularity":0.0696,"poster_path":"/4vSTZxp3VqBi5YkcgoUVnYpgyC3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midnight Cabaret","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3446821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Hilton","original_name":"Brandon Hilton","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"621c71ea1f98d10043329aca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3446822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elexius Kelly","original_name":"Elexius Kelly","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"621c71f027d9cc006c7f0e44","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3446823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Yon","original_name":"Arthur Yon","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"621c71f71bf876001cdd4454","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1344782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Mac","original_name":"Jason Mac","popularity":0.1509,"profile_path":"/kdYOxra9VQKeAQzVYvJniZSbu8d.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"621c71fe0328b900438cde29","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3446824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Younts","original_name":"Justin Younts","popularity":0.0364,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"621c720529c6260042adc74c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3446825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Finch","original_name":"Will Finch","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"621c7216c616ac007357c267","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3446826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Cleys","original_name":"Kevin Cleys","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"621c722f0792e10066e501f0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2236634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donna R.
