A Wolf kills one of the sheep owned by two poor brothers who then start hunting the animal. They run, jump and sneak through the lonely snow-covered countryside. Biting cold, danger and toil everywhere. People do not live in this winterly realm, they survive; sometimes by mere chance: While they are away hunting the wolf, the two brothers evade the deportation of their entire village by Soviet authorities, accompanied by many casualties. Again, they follow a trail - only instead of a wolf’s trail, they now follow one of footsteps and blood. The hostile mountains and dangerous nature, which seem to hold no love for men, suddenly appear in a different light: It is man himself who holds the least love for his fellow human beings.","popularity":0.3101,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Chechnya","title":"February","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380267,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruslan Magomadov","original_name":"Ruslan Magomadov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54544e9e0e0a2648c5002e6a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380267,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruslan Magomadov","original_name":"Ruslan Magomadov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54544d23c3a3682be90007d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12645786","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1450,"name":"shepherd"},{"id":33688,"name":"hunting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
