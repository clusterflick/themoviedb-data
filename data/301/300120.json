Disillusioned by the hyper-reality of the media world, he joins Robert de Niro evening classes, but also falls under the pastoral influence of Johnny Morris. From the opening images of night-time, car-ridden streets accompanied by languorous sax on the soundtrack, through to the sub-Chandleresque voice-over narration, Taxi Driver II strikes you with its clever knowingness. But it's more than just a clever nod in the direction of contemporary film noir, just as it's more than an incestuous joke at the expense of the London based media world: it's a telling comment on the contemporary media culture of postmodernism.","popularity":0.2406,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":9210,"logo_path":"/ruUf9qymJ1gKLmerDKO8pgq1CYM.png","name":"Film Four International","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taxi Driver Two","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5222851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Aris","original_name":"Nathan Aris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67a11e70beb8ffee8526377b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5222852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roderick Coyne","original_name":"Roderick Coyne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67a11e77beb8ffee8526378b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5222855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Edwards","original_name":"Richard Edwards","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67a11e7ebeb8ffee852637a1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1229046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominic Hawksley","original_name":"Dominic Hawksley","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67a11e852505cac8e002e8d2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Morris","original_name":"Johnny Morris","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67a11e91beb8ffee852637a8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5222857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve O'Dowell","original_name":"Steve O'Dowell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67a11e997ebb0614ff269bff","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Packham","original_name":"Neil Packham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67a11ea3a45287b7fde2b4d9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5222858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Teare","original_name":"Nick Teare","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67a11eaabeb8ffee852637bb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5222859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baz Van Dam","original_name":"Baz Van Dam","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67a11eb1a45287b7fde2b4e7","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Barber","original_name":"George Barber","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5452e0360e0a265f2b0006d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Barber","original_name":"George Barber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a11ed8ed829ebc56e2b573","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Barber","original_name":"George Barber","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a11ede35d30975b602ec9e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5222860,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maria C.
