Due to the circumstances of the time and his lack of prospects, the young Bimbo has become a hoodlum who keeps his head above water with petty crime. One night he robs the writer Percy, but is picked up by the police shortly afterwards in a drunken state. As he has Percy's wallet with him, the police think he is the robber and take him to his address. Percy can hardly believe his eyes when he sees the robber again. But instead of handing him over to the police, he takes Bimbo under his wing and tries to make a better person out of him - not an easy task.","popularity":0.3116,"poster_path":"/q4M7nMBAY17p7R0vmg8aEqabZXg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orlando-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1951-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mein
