It was produced in response to President Nixon’s famous November, 1969 speech when he contrasted the unlawful and vocal anti-war protesters to the respectful “silent majority” who were in favor of remaining in Vietnam to fight communism. This film explores the thoughts and opinions of the “silent majority” represented by the folks living in the Garfield Ridge neighborhood on the southwest side of Chicago.","popularity":0.1281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"8 Flags for 99¢","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315768,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chuck Olin","original_name":"Chuck Olin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Interviewer","credit_id":"545813b0c3a36839ac000438","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315768,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chuck Olin","original_name":"Chuck Olin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5458136a0e0a2611550004b6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315768,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chuck Olin","original_name":"Chuck Olin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5458137ec3a36839ac00042e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0478491","wikidata_id":"Q122929118","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":520,"name":"chicago, illinois"},{"id":2957,"name":"vietnam war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
