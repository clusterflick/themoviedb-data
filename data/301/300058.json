For the thousands of fans who travel to the Isle of Man each year it is a pilgrimage to the shrine of motorcycling. This documentary captures the spirit and character that surrounds the festival through the eyes of those involved in it. Through director Andy Stickland’s candid approach, the real TT is seen on film for perhaps the first time. It reveals the emotions, fears and thrills throughout the fortnight that go hand-in-hand with the excitement of the racing. It offers an all-access pass to the pit lane tensions, and gives an angle to the TT that is seldom, if ever, seen by the spectator.","popularity":0.076,"poster_path":"/c2M8hSOU0JdkmXFkbiaNnyqYsTj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Feature-length documentary on the 2003 Isle of Man TT motorcycle race, including interviews with the riders, officials and spectators and behind-the-scenes footage.","title":"TT: A Film Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5193823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Strickland","original_name":"Andrew Strickland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678f76d32ef5be0b9c5b395d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5193825,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aisling Ridoutt","original_name":"Aisling Ridoutt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678f76efe1af20590faab511","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v71395p7QZeevHdZ1ZcLrDbjs45.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1423}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1038,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c2M8hSOU0JdkmXFkbiaNnyqYsTj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":692}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":345552,"name":"isle of man tt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TT - A Film Documentary","key":"pkPaoZBG-k8","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2009-09-10T13:21:42.000Z","id":"678f77952ef5be0b9c5b399a"}]}}}
