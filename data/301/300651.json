However, a few interruptions, including thinking for a moment that he sees a woman's body in his bed, having his car key not work, and thinking he hears his mother calling, delay his departure from home by almost a minute. When tragedy strikes close by, John revisits the morning's events. A phone call from his brother in Chicago confirms how odd this morning is. Did John experience telepathy or was it all coincidence? If radio waves can carry a communication, why not a mother's love?","popularity":0.4859,"poster_path":"/8PqCfPJ0KBfq5EtvSbn03jABStA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Do You Think?","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72063,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carey Wilson","original_name":"Carey Wilson","popularity":0.1307,"profile_path":"/pXnGTnHIJTFpHjGPFzFvmLBwoOD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5457b0bec3a36814730096c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Henry","original_name":"William Henry","popularity":0.3477,"profile_path":"/xus92cAGkL1QP5rtscEsF6htU61.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John Dough","credit_id":"5457b148c3a368642e002538","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":939702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Martel","original_name":"Jeanne Martel","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":"/5R0q2VAxBdYJPk9s6zZCFzHT9yj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Woman (uncredited)","credit_id":"617bef49387651008c0ed03f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109854,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jack Chertok","original_name":"Jack Chertok","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5457b03d0e0a2652780032e2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Tourneur","original_name":"Jacques Tourneur","popularity":0.2937,"profile_path":"/o3Du8pFBlQ22JXGTVw9IB9yKVuC.jpg","credit_id":"5457af9ec3a368209f001cdb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0191649","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8PqCfPJ0KBfq5EtvSbn03jABStA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208280,"name":"accident victim"},{"id":238129,"name":"mental telepathy"},{"id":243452,"name":"mother child bond"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
