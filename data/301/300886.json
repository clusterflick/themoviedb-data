And because the young couple are serious about each other, the parents must become acquainted. That the Ohnsorg family lives in a proper castle on the outskirts of Berlin is only a problem for Uwe because Maja is facing an entirely different one: Papa Ohnsorg turns out to be her secret lover Stefan.

However, Uwe’s broken down car bestows the Ohnsorg and the Rath family with a weekend together, during which more than one bomb will be dropped.","popularity":0.2752,"poster_path":"/9m9GLaV5T0j3N1RoEPJDtAvMP06.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16208,"logo_path":null,"name":"SUESSSAUERFILM","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family Fever","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Kaufmann","original_name":"Deborah Kaufmann","popularity":0.2956,"profile_path":"/uysGC2y3XPXZwriRyQHzRNWLNTK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Birgit Ohnsorg","credit_id":"56fd91d3c3a36865040000fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1331847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathrin Waligura","original_name":"Kathrin Waligura","popularity":0.1712,"profile_path":"/xivIJpdA27bvsG85FrHby0WkoVw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maja Roth","credit_id":"56fd91ec9251417bca000104","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jörg Witte","original_name":"Jörg Witte","popularity":0.1582,"profile_path":"/8K4FAZlY18UsYE8V17k0mb9hCUg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Stefan Ohnsorg","credit_id":"56fd91fec3a3686501000105","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Trabner","original_name":"Peter Trabner","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":"/rXKWKrId0bmx3hfBO3alTQ0vTI7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Uwe Roth","credit_id":"57a6f88e925141783c0025a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anais Urban","original_name":"Anais Urban","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Alina Roth","credit_id":"57a6f8c7925141411a000d45","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Amazigh Sid","original_name":"Jan Amazigh Sid","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Nico Ohnsorg","credit_id":"57a6f8da925141411a000d4f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381844,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Fink","original_name":"Daniel Fink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5459589e0e0a26116500266c","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nico Sommer","original_name":"Nico Sommer","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5459585c0e0a26115b002606","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381845,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Eugen Gritschneder","original_name":"Eugen Gritschneder","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"545958ecc3a36839ac0022eb","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nico Sommer","original_name":"Nico Sommer","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54a25a59c3a3680b2700c9fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381845,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Eugen Gritschneder","original_name":"Eugen Gritschneder","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a6f84f9251415f870000ad","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3424758","wikidata_id":"Q18020115","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/9m9GLaV5T0j3N1RoEPJDtAvMP06.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.73,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/g29z6xGlB1qkMdctZQ4sg1VdJwz.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1460}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
