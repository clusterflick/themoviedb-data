Andrei Serban's extravagant, highly baroque staging presents the four exotic love stories vibrantly. In 'Le Turc généreux' Osman sets free his captive, Emilie, whom he loves, so that she may be reunited with her former lover, Valère; 'Les Incas de Pérou' is all about the rivalry of the Inca Huascar and the Spaniard Don Carlos, both in pursuit of Princess Phani; 'Les Fleurs' offers a Persian love intrigue, as the Sultana Fatime tries to detect whether her husband Tacmas has his eye on the lovely Atalide; and 'Les Sauvages' takes us to North America, where a Spaniard and a Frenchman compete for the love of Zima, daughter of a native chief, who prefers one of her own people.\" — from the DVD cover","popularity":0.5764,"poster_path":"/3sz5SPtueF9fcxqYgxv9dgMHTPe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":79626,"logo_path":"/evt7rNSFXOHCMyDb3Pj1CqjASvE.png","name":"Les Arts Florissants","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":190,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Indes Galantes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les Indes Galantes (2004) Opéra National de Paris","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle de Niese","original_name":"Danielle de Niese","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/zQna8AK2jSpbAxcDaU9YsNl96Ga.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Prologue: Hébé","credit_id":"55a701269251411e110008ad","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":58818,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"João Fernandes","original_name":"João Fernandes","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/qjn3vF9Q70xuulkfhMgSHmnGgI.jpg","cast_id":32,"character":"Prologue: Bellone","credit_id":"596c1f0a9251413b3d0093f5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valérie Gabail","original_name":"Valérie Gabail","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Prologue: L'Amour","credit_id":"5699206492514125460042d8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Cavallier","original_name":"Nicolas Cavallier","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"1ère entrée -
