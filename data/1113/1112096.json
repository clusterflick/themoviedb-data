The book has caused international frenzy amongst the media and the public. Opinion is now more divided than ever on whether Prince Harry should retain his royal titles. Though Harry and Meghan fled the royal family for a second chance at the private life they always wanted, the world refused to let them go quietly. Despite their escape, the media's continued attention cased a barrage of headlines, flaring up rumour after scandalous rumour about the couple and the royal family. In order to set the record straight, they decided to tell their own side of the story, giving a tell-all series of interviews, podcasts and Netflix documentary series. But eclipsing all of the revelations shared previously, in January 2023 Harry released his controversial and much-anticipated autobiography, Spare.","popularity":0.2093,"poster_path":"/m1AYjIZNmPXKPpvz2q20pesg43d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prince Harry: Being the Spare","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932219,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Aabech","original_name":"Brian Aabech","popularity":0.1926,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64368053aede5900b6c177fd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26447156","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cGGB10k0MfMtxLX9pYuxroTvXV7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m1AYjIZNmPXKPpvz2q20pesg43d.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4qi9618AMRE9jgqEAro34cGSqNq.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/htzLXC6dNi1zKNLk15ijMkVsjSu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
