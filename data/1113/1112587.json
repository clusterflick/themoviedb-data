From the 1950s to the 1980s, René Desmaison achieved a large number of \"firsts\". A specialist in normal routes (west face of Les Drus, Pilier du Freyney, Shroud...), he experienced a tragedy at the Grandes Jorasses, where his exceptional resistance allowed him to survive against all logic. He is the first to claim the practice of the mountain as a high level sport. A man of contrasts, his apparent strength hides great shyness and an unalterable enthusiasm despite the years. Beyond mountaineering, it is the spirit of adventure that has always inhabited him. A whole life devoted to mountaineering.","popularity":0.3656,"poster_path":"/cPKiKiCPZiUmpCGiumnmfuKABuv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22123,"logo_path":"/zPTy6QDAlCKGeAALZoFEL3QAlut.png","name":"TF1","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":173548,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Soleil","origin_country":""},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Conquérants De l'Impossible : Portrait De René Desmaison","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3723782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Desmaison","original_name":"René Desmaison","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/zvPD0Z5V54sVzpn2FaXe912IXIR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6437fb8481a7fc007872cbe3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":112001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone Desmaison","original_name":"Simone Desmaison","popularity":0.0472,"profile_path":"/sXP5Zl8Vy0c5BqedOH3ZA0P7JIV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6438142a4a52f80077b8e64c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2906737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Couzy","original_name":"Jean Couzy","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/oGE4IjoXUh8bmvYTUCiRKlDhDJ8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6437fff54a52f800f4f74998","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3723748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Hemming","original_name":"Gary Hemming","popularity":0.1346,"profile_path":"/u5mvVID49V9cvD7vVoI2n5vK5n7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6437ffd4ab684901033614b9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4008461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Gousseault","original_name":"Serge Gousseault","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ssDuBrFltagODdO3VDs0noKlwo.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6437ffff1d53860077a45911","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3266057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Choquet","original_name":"Bernard Choquet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6437fc644a52f800d5e351dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dKkC3zePSaKHnWyMhfmnJN8vsSd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/27TLS3GPxgX3p3GNf2UeZdz2K1E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1923,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cPKiKiCPZiUmpCGiumnmfuKABuv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":486,"name":"himalaya mountain range"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":160177,"name":"mountaineering"},{"id":215368,"name":"chamonix"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":266669,"name":"alpes"},{"id":307583,"name":"goat climber"},{"id":316006,"name":"alpinism legend"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
