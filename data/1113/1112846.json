Ansari shares, “Expressing her thoughts on discrimination and inequality, Forough described Iranian women’s untold suffering. In a letter dated January 2, 1956, Forough wrote, ‘My wish is for Iranian women to be free and equal to men. I am fully aware that my sisters in this country suffer from men’s injustices, and I use half of my art to articulate their pain and anguish.’ Forough’s poetry symbolizes a woman imprisoned by ancient traditions and seeking the light.”  Ansari’s film, Another Birth, is titled after  Farrokhzad writing, Another Birth, published in 1963.","popularity":0.0459,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Birth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4009471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rose Ansari","original_name":"Rose Ansari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643894e0c2679601268f90a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
