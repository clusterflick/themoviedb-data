Lu Ang’s middle-class family struggles with a lack of communication, while Yu Ming’s single father resorts to violence to “teach” him. Both boys share a sense of loneliness, which deepens when they save a transfer student, Zheng Wanhe, from campus violence. The three form a bond and join the school chorus. However, their families face major crises: looming divorces, grandparents falling victim to scams, and personal trauma. As they navigate these challenges, Lu Ang and Yu Ming gain a new understanding of life, friendship, and identity. The film addresses significant social issues such as bullying, child abuse, and the emotional toll of growing up in a society fraught with pressure, offering a poignant exploration of adolescence in modern China.","popularity":0.0516,"poster_path":"/oItCv4WzbsTiQyCKRS8ncgAeFen.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2023-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Teenager's Diary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2957552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Bin","original_name":"李斌","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c0b821c029139b0e35b932","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1619,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oItCv4WzbsTiQyCKRS8ncgAeFen.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Children's Film Festival Bangladesh","release_date":"2021-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
