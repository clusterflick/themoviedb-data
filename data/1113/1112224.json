Reluctantly persuaded into a friends-night-out at one of their old New York City haunts, Nathan finds himself a stranger in a world where “swiping culture” dominates meaningful connection. When his friends well-intentioned frivolity stirs up visions of what once was, Nathan is caught between the desire to move on and the pervading sense he’s been left behind.","popularity":0.6184,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":197686,"logo_path":null,"name":"MT Shorts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This moment is all that we have","title":"Still Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3281011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathaniel Stampley","original_name":"Nathaniel Stampley","popularity":0.1056,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Nathan","credit_id":"6436edb51f748b00d5ef6f47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2878196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lana Gordon","original_name":"Lana Gordon","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Samantha","credit_id":"6436edc3fd4f8000955498ef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3683077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Dawson","original_name":"Michelle Dawson","popularity":0.0451,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Ellen","credit_id":"6436ee681f748b00f4489d63","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4007236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Harris","original_name":"David Harris","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Mitchell","credit_id":"6436ef7daede5900b6c1a120","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4007238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Rodriguez","original_name":"Nicholas Rodriguez","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Josh","credit_id":"6436f00f1f748b00b6a3d8ac","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lance Roberts","original_name":"Lance Roberts","popularity":0.1852,"profile_path":"/hCqhIj2FTIOiykJAvnBicyt4umZ.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Derek","credit_id":"6436f01e1f748b0077154810","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1027220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Roy","original_name":"Natalie Roy","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/iQZkciScwg5O0vJS6CTcZr48BFv.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Nicole","credit_id":"6436f04dfd4f800077d3aeca","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arlene A.
