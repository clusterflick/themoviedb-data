The academic and political discussion of women's liberation and feminism (as part of the sexual revolution of the 1970s) draws inspiration from 'The Scum Manifesto' by Valerie Solanas and juxtaposes these passage with country music from the same era; notably 'The Pill' by Loretta Lynn, 'Just Because I'm A Woman' by Dolly Parton and, most centrally, 'Stand By Your Man' by Tammy Wynette.","popularity":0.4526,"poster_path":"/w8rpOumlaDZU6mbYsPoe6TfrKSE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Davo Hardy
