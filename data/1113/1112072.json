The journey, which seems to be directed from the beyond by the dead, becomes a double adventure: a comic adventure, in which the ashes take all the center stage; and a dramatic adventure, that of the friends' reunion with a former love of their youth, their former gym coach. The reunion will cause a decisive transformation in each of them and will serve to close old wounds and to overcome personal conflicts.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/lS3KTlwOY0GBJeDCK6ut0gnMO8S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1.000 maneres de menjar-se un ou","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafa Montesinos","original_name":"Rafa Montesinos","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64366708945d3600bca25743","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2493418","wikidata_id":"Q111677379","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vQLJCc8WZPqdpuwCv258iBuyyYm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/lS3KTlwOY0GBJeDCK6ut0gnMO8S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
