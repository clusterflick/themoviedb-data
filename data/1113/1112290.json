Musical composition being guided by the principle of montage and editing centralized in the amplification and systematization of the gesture, QUIPROCÓ has at its core the thread that traverses both the making of  both cinema and music: the space of memory formed through the succession and juxtaposition of things in time.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/rO2o3w9f7V0c0qjNG5SqobSdwUd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197698,"logo_path":null,"name":"F(r)esta Festival de Improvisação e
