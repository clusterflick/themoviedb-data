The band bridged the gap from country music to rock and pop, and although their live shows had their share of comedy and the band were renowned for their raunchy sense of humour, they were also noted for their first class musicianship and vocals. This film features a live performance at the Musikladen Studios in Germany.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/y3lYJePrNGkHqXaquu8k8ZeuqY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dr Hook And The Medicine Show: Musikladen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y3lYJePrNGkHqXaquu8k8ZeuqY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
