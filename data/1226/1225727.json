It depicts how human and nonhuman life come together to revive their surroundings. It imagines a new home, a home built on humility, resourcefulness, and imagination. A home strong enough to weather the storm, to rise from the flood, to endure the heat. This might be a hotter, wetter, more organic city cohabited by all species. Hope is the linchpin of resurgence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Refuge for Resurgence, Window View","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4461498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Superflux","original_name":"Superflux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659498fb5907de077d63a30f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
