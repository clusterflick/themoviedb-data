Coming from 5 completely different backgrounds in the U.S. and Canada, the climbers each have a unique personality, perspective, and approach to climbing. The film celebrates those differences and show that there’s no one way to “be a climber.”  With full-time jobs as a software engineer, nurse, marketing manager, dog trainer, and healthcare policy analyst, these women are not pro climbers, but they’ve dedicated their lives to getting after it outside and climbing hard boulder problems whenever they can. This film isn’t just about showcasing rad climbs, but first and foremost to show the world that women are stronger together than we are divided. But of course there will be plenty of impressive sending going on too!","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/qFbcQT4CJ6ctrV6pIUjasSDSRQ5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":217485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Potato Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girls Gone Hueco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4463022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Midori Buechli","original_name":"Midori Buechli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6595e1bb326ec1063806c176","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4463030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Beauchemin","original_name":"Zoe Beauchemin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6595e1ddd7a70a12ff693bb6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4463032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sera Gearhart","original_name":"Sera Gearhart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6595e1eaa698cf78c343a069","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4463034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Barlaug","original_name":"Amanda Barlaug","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6595e1f70e64af31638c19f5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4463238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenn DeBellis","original_name":"Jenn DeBellis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"659611ee869e75708e066e01","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4462669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Long Truong","original_name":"Long Truong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6595a71dd7a70a11c7698fcd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4462706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Ellison","original_name":"Julie Ellison","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6595b082d7a70a11c76994f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4463022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Midori Buechli","original_name":"Midori Buechli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6595e1b1326ec17df606c18b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4462669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Long Truong","original_name":"Long Truong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6595e3af0e64af47428c1911","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4462669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Long Truong","original_name":"Long Truong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6595e3c1ea37e008264bc011","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4463370,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jessica Best","original_name":"Jessica Best","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659634eb0e64af04548c1989","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30487304","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iUlpHXr7tDzhbKUCj3UtQziZTws.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qFbcQT4CJ6ctrV6pIUjasSDSRQ5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Girls Gone Hueco Trailer","key":"gScdMmw9KRs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-08-15T13:20:41.000Z","id":"6595e3e8ef9d723ebf12aed9"}]}}}
