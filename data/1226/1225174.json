This series of performances from the prestigious \"Montreux Jazz Festival\" now makes a part of this legacy available on DVD for the first time.  Mary Lou Williams is considered by many to be jazz's greatest female musician. As an arranger and performer she worked with all the great jazzmen of the twentieth century. In this historic performance from 1978 the spiritual dimension of her music and life is powerfully evident in such classics as The Lord Is Heavy and Offertory Meditation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gHJVZSLtiO0aTzKp9vQyhUeIxFE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Norman Granz’ Jazz in Montreaux presents Mary Lou Williams ’78","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gHJVZSLtiO0aTzKp9vQyhUeIxFE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
