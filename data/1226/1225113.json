It contains harrowing scenes of starving children but also puts the horrors into a geopolitical context. This is Pilger’s first documentary to highlight his theme of expendability, whereby countries with no oil, strategic value or military power are considered unimportant to the superpowers. Bangladesh, he points out, is not one of the United States’s “client states” on a priority list to receive its surplus food.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/k5Z9jF3XRNZvs5v5xvz62I6wLF5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Unfashionable Tragedy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Pilger","original_name":"John Pilger","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/jgV0P0JOkDAKLaOBEuaoRdlhFp2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6592cdeba58902732d95fecb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Ingram","original_name":"John Ingram","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6592cdd6e640d60211d5a3e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Ingram","original_name":"John Ingram","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6592cde2ce4ddc6cd37eb326","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4671052","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k5Z9jF3XRNZvs5v5xvz62I6wLF5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
