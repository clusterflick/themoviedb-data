Like an uncontrollable and inexplicable loop, anxiety often entails short but repeated episodes of intense fear. This feeling of terror comes as a series of unexpected attacks that enslaves the mind of the one who is going through it. My Bathtub is Linked to the Sea attempts to visualize and express this sense of circular entrapment. Through the protagonistâ€™s monologue and her journey of deteriorating perceptions, the work explores the dark state that haunts those who are under the spell of psychological disorders.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"My Bathtub is Linked to the Sea is a short experimental work that deals with the idea and experience of anxiety.","title":"My Bathtub Is Linked To The Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4411779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ty Lok Yi Scarlett","original_name":"Ty Lok Yi Scarlett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65950164326ec12c9506c1b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
