In the 1964 General Election, a swing to the Conservative Party in Labour’s Smethwick constituency and Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech on immigration four years later put attitudes towards ethnic minorities on the political and social agenda. In One British Family, made in 1974, John Pilger focuses on Gus and Julie Gill, who arrived in Britain from Trinidad in 1961. They now had three children and their own house on Tyneside, where they were the only black family in the street. “They take less from the social services than the equivalent white families,” says Pilger. “They’re not on any council’s housing lists and they’ve never been out of work.”","popularity":0.1146,"poster_path":"/1RmoSYtUnJ5OHM7LHqheH7BxyGw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One British Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Pilger","original_name":"John Pilger","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/jgV0P0JOkDAKLaOBEuaoRdlhFp2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6593f133ebb99d5e17a030b3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187603,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Denton","original_name":"Charles Denton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6592cd05e640d60140d5ee77","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Ingram","original_name":"John Ingram","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6592ccf9e004a66d6317e205","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4671050","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1RmoSYtUnJ5OHM7LHqheH7BxyGw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
