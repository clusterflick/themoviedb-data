During the course of it David Hockney makes two drawings of one of his favourite subjects, Celia Birtwell. The caricaturist and illustrator Ralph Steadman is seen at work in his studio, as well as drawing some of the regulars in his local pub. And the American Jim Dine, well-known first in the 60â€™ as a pop artist, completes this trio of contemporary artists, all of them preoccupied by drawing and talking freely, not only about their own approach, but about the work of other artists they admire. The film also includes unique archive film and photographs of Matisse and Giacometti, as well as quotations from the notebooks and letters of major European artists from Leonardo da Vinci to Degas and Van Gogh.","popularity":0.102,"poster_path":"/7b4TUM4GUXxOiws7k4sa5nOon9h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seeing Through Drawing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hockney","original_name":"David Hockney","popularity":0.1373,"profile_path":"/mUPzSASAKnpR9FjkUXz7LcOfKv5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6592f9f46aa8e061abebe3e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Steadman","original_name":"Ralph Steadman","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6592fa7951a64e020af53c37","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2253882,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Goldsmith","original_name":"Michael Goldsmith","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6592fa97069f0e5c172110ee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1405980","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7b4TUM4GUXxOiws7k4sa5nOon9h.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/79RqzcTXv10fjhyMWtwEJ9ROrcT.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
