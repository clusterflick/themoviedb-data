The foundation aimed to supply humanitarian aid to the Palestinians in Palestine and countries hosting Palestinian refugees, it later became the largest charity association in the US to distribute humanitarian aid to Palestinians. After 9/11, the former US President George W. Bush issued a decision to shut down the Holy Land Foundation and freeze its assets. In 2007 the Holy Land Foundation trials began, where five of its members were charged with funding terrorism and sending money to Hamas, a blacklisted political group in the US. A second trial for the Holy Land Foundation members took place in 2008, which issued the convictions of five members of the Foundation and their sentencing of 65 years imprisonment.","popularity":0.5409,"poster_path":"/1M2xixhb8hmlzhrNBF5u3w97GpZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62165,"logo_path":"/9i15HMPXjW657H4BnrMkeQcbktL.png","name":"Al Jazeera","origin_country":"QA"},{"id":110711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Al Jazeera America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching for Freedom: The Holy Land Foundation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4461329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Platt","original_name":"Richard Platt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65947a2aea3949098d1b515c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammed Omari","original_name":"Mohammed Omari","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659479f7211ce50bc6291cad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7433872","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1214,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1M2xixhb8hmlzhrNBF5u3w97GpZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":537,"name":"palestine"},{"id":11038,"name":"trial"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"باحثون عن الحرية - مؤسسة الأرض المقدسة 1","key":"1xfuivrkMHQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-05-24T10:59:44.000Z","id":"65947af0211ce515f3291cfe"}]}}}
