The film shows a cross-section of a community: young, old, modern, traditional - all with something in common, the desire to live and work in a dignified way, through hand-worked crafts. People in the film are both fragile and powerful in their raw honesty against the backdrop of increasingly precarious conditions of labor. \"Inherited Crafts\" carries a self-reflective style, being made by Osman Yuseinov, himself a craftsman, a master jeweler, working and living in Stolipinovo.","popularity":0.0594,"poster_path":"/2r7pnMgOJJOfMjI09OUB4xd6i9z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2021-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inherited Crafts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Успадковані ремесла","type":"festival title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4461213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Osman Yuseinov","original_name":"Osman Yuseinov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65946632028f147823c5ccc4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4461215,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikola Venkov","original_name":"Nikola Venkov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65946670e004a66e2317a213","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30766114","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"duvarkolektiv","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2r7pnMgOJJOfMjI09OUB4xd6i9z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Stolipinovo, public screening","release_date":"2021-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sofia, public screening","release_date":"2021-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Plovdiv, public screening","release_date":"2021-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Bulgarian edition","release_date":"2023-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Inherited Crafts - Trailer","key":"4paJShhq0Zw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-03T10:37:31.000Z","id":"659465b3a5890273969600b8"}]}}}
