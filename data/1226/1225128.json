In Pyramid Lake Is Dying, he reports on the demise in the culture of native Americans and the stealing of their resources. Pyramid Lake, in Nevada, home to the Paiute peoples and once described as “one of the few remaining unspoiled natural wonders in the American West”, is drying up and its fisheries and wildlife disappearing  due to changes to the local ecology made by white settlers. In addition to their natural resources, the Paiute peoples' culture and lifestyle are also under threat.","popularity":0.0881,"poster_path":"/c8cHYA7VkJkeYN332f9cQmE57A2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pyramid Lake Is Dying","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Pilger","original_name":"John Pilger","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/jgV0P0JOkDAKLaOBEuaoRdlhFp2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6593f15da58902739695f7db","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Marquand","original_name":"Richard Marquand","popularity":0.1949,"profile_path":"/eEalDQpLsXJqejPDQ3MWGe95UHT.jpg","credit_id":"6592d379a589027259965a8e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2529972,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Creasey","original_name":"Richard Creasey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6592d38a028f147694c66eb4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Marquand","original_name":"Richard Marquand","popularity":0.1949,"profile_path":"/eEalDQpLsXJqejPDQ3MWGe95UHT.jpg","credit_id":"6592d36b1dcb776b19460387","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4671076","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c8cHYA7VkJkeYN332f9cQmE57A2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
