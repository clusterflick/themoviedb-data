Ambrogio, from the Brera art gallery to the library Ambrosiana, custodian of Leonardo's priceless Atlantic Codex. A journey into art that takes the viewer to the presence of Vinci's Last Supper but also among the \"Seven Heavenly Palaces\", the gigantic installation by Anselm Kiefer kept in the Pirelli Hangar Bicocca, or among the futurists of the Museo del Novecento. A journey into the history of the city, former capital of the Roman Empire, proud medieval municipality and one of the most splendid lordships with the Viscontis and the Sforzas. This route does not lack the most representative places of Milanese life today, such as the Central Station, the Gallery, the Navigli and the skyscrapers that have redesigned the skyline in recent decades.","popularity":0.2667,"poster_path":"/1VO68sf7vD3Pto0DBsMsxmX1COU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stanotte a Milano","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1609468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Angela","original_name":"Alberto Angela","popularity":0.0952,"profile_path":"/x1i7TeFIpF2dI2SeFCBLPMwaI6Z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"6593a02ea5890271199750c3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1609523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriele Cipollitti","original_name":"Gabriele Cipollitti","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6593a040ebb99d5e17a0089b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yusauanjDMjpg4PdG39IOgkWwqd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1VO68sf7vD3Pto0DBsMsxmX1COU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Rai 1","release_date":"2022-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
