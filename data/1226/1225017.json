Even fewer know that there is an elite group of runners who brave dozens of bull runs each year, risking their life to run inches away from the sharp horns of the 1000+ pound ferocious animals they revere. Chasing Red is a character-driven documentary following 4 runners across the eight bull runs of a single fiesta in Pamplona. Braving through injury and looming risk of death, they embark on an endeavor that will shape their lives forever.","popularity":0.3517,"poster_path":"/7FJKBLsuXRYgqN9pA1V9g5mayBj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":217255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Margin
