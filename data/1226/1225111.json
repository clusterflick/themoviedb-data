John Pilger subsequently interviewed Wallace on the campaign trail during two general elections.During the second, in 1972, Wallace was shot in an assassination attempt, leaving him paralysed and in a wheelchair. In The Most Powerful Politician in America, made in 1974, Pilger looks at the likelihood that a reinvented Wallace will run for the White House two years later, manipulating contemporary American passions and exploiting his influence in the powerful “Dixie” states controlled by the Democratic Party.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/aE8VbxWNVk1Oq08KaRhwWI31Hf3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Most Powerful Politician in America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Pilger","original_name":"John Pilger","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/jgV0P0JOkDAKLaOBEuaoRdlhFp2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6592cbfbe640d602e2d5729f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187603,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Denton","original_name":"Charles Denton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6592cbe7e640d67ee0d65af0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187603,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Denton","original_name":"Charles Denton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6592cbf151a64e020af52614","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4671046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aE8VbxWNVk1Oq08KaRhwWI31Hf3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
