But suddenly Malte shows up at his home, his best friend from his youth, whom he hasn't seen in over 30 years. While Malte apparently wants to seamlessly continue the old friendship, Patrick remains distant at first and reproaches the unexpected visitor for his disappearance from the small town and out of his life at the time. He wonders what Malte wants from him and why he's back now of all times. Over the course of a day and night they spend at Patrick's parents' house, the scene of their youth, it turns out that Malte hasn't turned up again by accident. Things are said that were previously unsaid. The next morning, both men see their lives in a completely new light and nothing is the same anymore.","popularity":0.1956,"poster_path":"/ffEWhAw6VdMJ9WoJw03owMS4Nrp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9291,"logo_path":"/g6GYZXQrjB86Z5ocVliUZF1i3Tz.png","name":"HR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freunde","video":false,"vote_average":5.667,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Immer
