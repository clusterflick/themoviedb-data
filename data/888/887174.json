The name is a reference to the primordial ritual within Candomblé, Bori, a ritual in Yoruba that means “to feed the head”. Videodança is a tribute to the Ori entity, with which we celebrate all the contribution of knowledge generated from the cultural manifestations of blacks. “Bori” is a table of food provided by African matrices, their stories, bodies, religiosities, symbolic universes, philosophies, music and dances. Food for the eyes, ears, memories, for the past and for the present.","popularity":0.0498,"poster_path":"/wPrMBVMuRAbSE8oAnoOzjYM1vNa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bori","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3276936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luiz Anastácio","original_name":"Luiz Anastácio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616f19ac13a3200044e15ff4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3276936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luiz Anastácio","original_name":"Luiz Anastácio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61941cfc6c0b360028c2cf56","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312423,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ian Muntoreanu","original_name":"Ian Muntoreanu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61941d186c1e04006196955f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3276936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luiz Anastácio","original_name":"Luiz Anastácio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61941d0376eecf002a6619d8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3276936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luiz Anastácio","original_name":"Luiz Anastácio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61941d7c0f2fbd0092ecdf25","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3276936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luiz Anastácio","original_name":"Luiz Anastácio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61941d85d4d5090020609615","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312423,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ian Muntoreanu","original_name":"Ian Muntoreanu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61941d7221c4ca009230883a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"grupoewe","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dU2tcAI3YZAjgUoVO0cL6mf2mHe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":905,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wPrMBVMuRAbSE8oAnoOzjYM1vNa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":607}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"29º Festival Mix Brasil","release_date":"2021-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer Bori","key":"DcTGL9aMd0g","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-10-07T14:20:40.000Z","id":"61941c761dbc880027a4146d"}]}}}
