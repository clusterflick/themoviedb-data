It is their secret wish that their grandson Kim-kwong (Yam Kim-fai) would marry an ill-tempered woman—it would be, Kau and Lee think, poetic justice for Tang to have a taste of her own medicine.  But to their disappointment, the granddaughter-in-law Yu-chu (Law Yim-hing) turns out to be meek and understanding.  Kau and his wife therefore tricks Yu-chu into starting a quarrel with Tang.  Rich in intricate details of everyday life, the film depicts a witty battle between vivid characters, and is a comedic portrayal of the relationship between mother and daughter-in-law through three generations.","popularity":0.7981,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tao Yuen Motion Picture Development
