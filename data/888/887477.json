The film contains the first ever scenes of water-boarding showing the rebel being tortured supervised by a British intelligence officer. A dramatic search through the streets of London follows, culminating in a tense life or death confrontation. The film became a cause-célèbre in England, was critically acclaimed and discussed in the Houses of Parliament.","popularity":0.4561,"poster_path":"/yPJNxk54iviW49K4Ev2wmyrOXli.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114701,"logo_path":null,"name":"Onyx Films
