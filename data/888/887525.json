In 2017, he chronicled this journey in 20-minute performance poem 'Rock, Star, North.', which premiered at the Scottish Storytelling Centre in Edinburgh. Now, in 2021, this poem achieves its *final form*: a filmpoem - or 'machinipoem', if you will - composed entirely of shots from the game, alongside an all-new reading and updated text. Calum invites you to join him in the vast and extraordinary world of Los Santos and Blaine County, in pursuit of what he calls 'the virtual sublime'.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6ZnXtaZUWlTVE251gjHuGY9ueOa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A poetic travelogue set in the world of Grand Theft Auto V","title":"Rock, Star, North.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Rock, Star, North.
