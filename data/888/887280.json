It is an assemblage of her father’s African collection, photographs made by Ottinger in the 1970s, footage of a theatre play based on Johann Nestroy and a rare artefact: an 8mm film document of Lil Picard’s birthday celebration—an artist who mingled with the Dadaists and Warhol’s Factory alike. It is an exhibition in the form of a film, a dedication to an adventurer father, a secret art museum, a cabinet of wonder: a whole universe on its own.","popularity":0.0923,"poster_path":"/lCNmOB7NjHfg2B59cQwncNh8U7I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Moving","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrike Ottinger","original_name":"Ulrike Ottinger","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/4mhoFrgqnqwJCaqTSSgANClrfAL.jpg","credit_id":"616f48cfba131b00434f7411","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":568127,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bettina Blickwede","original_name":"Bettina Blickwede","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65916e14651fcf5f138e3317","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrike Ottinger","original_name":"Ulrike Ottinger","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/4mhoFrgqnqwJCaqTSSgANClrfAL.jpg","credit_id":"65916e35028f1476eac5a6dc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrike Ottinger","original_name":"Ulrike Ottinger","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/4mhoFrgqnqwJCaqTSSgANClrfAL.jpg","credit_id":"66ac889970bde47920a158fb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lCNmOB7NjHfg2B59cQwncNh8U7I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
