Vijay is quite popular as the only Public Prosecutor to have succeeded in bringing down the crime rate, resulting in the highest number of convictions. He also gets to prosecute Abbas Mohamed Riyaz for killing Inspector Bhagwat and Sukhdev Walia, a former gangster. Abbas is tried, found guilty, and sentenced to be hanged. Then Vijay's girlfriend, Sapna, finds evidence that it was someone else who was responsible for these killings. Vijay agrees to represent Abbas, find the real culprit(s), and ensure that the sentence is overturned. Before that could happen, Vijay is himself arrested for killing a woman by the name of Neena, thus making Abbas' hanging a certainty.","popularity":0.3833,"poster_path":"/6lvNKoJjFLvYEN7YRm5RdXDFofo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phaansi Ke Baad","video":false,"vote_average":9.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shatrughan Sinha","original_name":"Shatrughan Sinha","popularity":0.4567,"profile_path":"/qPjI1TdA2cYAcvSOUveCSYGOHmy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Public Prosecutor Vijay Kumar","credit_id":"61711f55abdec00029aad27f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hema Malini","original_name":"Hema Malini","popularity":0.5432,"profile_path":"/dfNRjtvbxisRSBDhCoUMuEFyY3V.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sapna","credit_id":"61711f6e176a94005f93e2f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shakti Kapoor","original_name":"Shakti Kapoor","popularity":0.417,"profile_path":"/fhVKy38jwGJyp82ptGPo0Y5Ca3k.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Abbas Mohamed Riyaz","credit_id":"61711fcd1d019100679f8273","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amrish Puri","original_name":"Amrish Puri","popularity":1.5076,"profile_path":"/uhMGFS7tuG71LDv2wk9LfZZ4EG6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Damodar Seth","credit_id":"61711ff4c8f8580094c39ae5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iftekhar","original_name":"Iftekhar","popularity":0.2393,"profile_path":"/xDtJUtXtibzMMh7FXxP9qmyM3gc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mohammed Riaz","credit_id":"63052a14b33903007c488aa9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":618699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jagdeep","original_name":"Jagdeep","popularity":0.3696,"profile_path":"/fDhNk4zi18lp3s69Q1Hu7n6X7wr.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jaggi","credit_id":"63052a232bcf67007f9498b7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Satyendra Kapoor","original_name":"Satyendra Kapoor","popularity":0.203,"profile_path":"/bUCaTNUuNkueIb1zAEiunqLfK5.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sukhdev Walia","credit_id":"63052a314cbe12008485680f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1580118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manik Irani","original_name":"Manik Irani","popularity":0.2833,"profile_path":"/g8QVlAySOtSVVMVGA7JNNvr2v5l.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Montha","credit_id":"63052a40db72c000914193c8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1028479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Urmila Bhatt","original_name":"Urmila Bhatt","popularity":0.1947,"profile_path":"/o8Wmx38BNH9pRLoxd0rH1q6rhWP.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Sapna's Mother","credit_id":"63052a50f925320082a13272","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ajit Khan","original_name":"Ajit Khan","popularity":0.2756,"profile_path":"/n1jzEpNe1zW2h9wwhgjg3N731YH.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"DIG Surendranath","credit_id":"63052a63f48e0d007c8e5eac","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37241,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anu Malik","original_name":"Anu Malik","popularity":0.2822,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617122055c5cc8009329e6d1","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harmesh Malhotra","original_name":"Harmesh Malhotra","popularity":0.2464,"profile_path":"/crogCeKP5KF37RenmSfLHNkPXgg.jpg","credit_id":"617121cfcadb6b0062d0fe58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0237565","wikidata_id":"Q11017581","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gL4Mcm11wRlM7ASQfoOWMWVQuOb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6lvNKoJjFLvYEN7YRm5RdXDFofo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1130}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"Eastern Films","release_date":"1985-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
