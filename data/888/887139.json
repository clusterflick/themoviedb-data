It deals with a couple's break-up. It is both a letter and a reflection, and it concerns giving of one's self, sharing and exchanging. It is also a response to the other person's flight, the absence, the void. The images attempt to replace the fear and silence. A need sublimated in the exacerbation of pleasure conveyed by images and sounds, Lettre à un amant is a masterful conclusion to the series. At the same time, it poses several questions about the dichotomous love-image paradox present in love. This work also refers to an earlier work by Marc Paradis, La Cage, because of its erotic homosexual content and its many electronic applications. Richard Anger's original score was composed to emphasize the dramatic aspect while several processes proper to the video medium serve to peg the images in an aesthetic approach.","popularity":0.3295,"poster_path":"/glHt5SqfT9PsC0PRrf8mySTQWHn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lettre à un amant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3276730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Paradis","original_name":"Marc Paradis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/f1pmMiH7r4HvdggAUwZzUtPl3kU.jpg","credit_id":"616efac5894ed60064656ba4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/glHt5SqfT9PsC0PRrf8mySTQWHn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":14602,"name":"break-up"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":275157,"name":"homosexuality"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
