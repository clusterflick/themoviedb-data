He was in Budapest on a scholarship when we first met. His voice was frank and his eyes fiery. He had a lot to say but he did not want to talk about the war back home. I filmed as I saw, as I perceived him moving in and out of uncertainty's quiet flicker. An unconventional portrait of my friend when he turned 23. His journey from Syria to Hungary, narrated as a blurry anecdote by the fire.","popularity":0.0725,"poster_path":"/xAnKtE6SkBecRzvjuOKMK29WTp8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait of Omar at 23","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4132249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omar Al Mourabet","original_name":"Omar Al Mourabet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6499ba0962f3350127476bb7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4132252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boróka Füredi","original_name":"Boróka Füredi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6499ba2162f33500ad019b47","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2899114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aman Wadhan","original_name":"Aman Wadhan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616f38711089ba0044c7ad6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4132261,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Aman Wadhan","original_name":"Aman Wadhan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6499bad0b3440900e273025e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4132249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omar Al Mourabet","original_name":"Omar Al Mourabet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6499bb1c6f43ec011c635eee","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2899114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aman Wadhan","original_name":"Aman Wadhan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6499bb2e955c6500ac8a2a30","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2899114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aman Wadhan","original_name":"Aman Wadhan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6499baf26f43ec00e27ecbd4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2700,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xAnKtE6SkBecRzvjuOKMK29WTp8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1823}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival international Signes de nuit","release_date":"2022-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2022-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
