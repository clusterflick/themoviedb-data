In Philippine mythology, a \"santelmo\" is a wandering soul of a deceased person who has not found peace yet. Similarly, young men wandering through countryside seek in vain reconciliation with the world in this hypnotic black and white poem that resembles the work of Lav Diaz because of its contemplative pace. The three young men, whose aimless journey is accompanied only by rustling of leaves and grass, chirping of insects, and singing of birds, speak about people for whom they have suffered and whom they plan to take revenge on. Yet, they are prevented from freeing themselves by memories that cannot be killed.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kKwtCZfOzRyQqLb8PflJOyR4ZPT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santelmo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liryc Dela Cruz","original_name":"Liryc Dela Cruz","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/wkpKm4JliU3bdBIlpA0F6Spe39H.jpg","credit_id":"61708b91894ed60042fa73a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kKwtCZfOzRyQqLb8PflJOyR4ZPT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
