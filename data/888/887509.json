In the installation, two images are projected onto a single screen, and the border between the two images becomes an imaginative site for visual and contextual exchange. Scenes of two girls playing a duet on the piano interact with scenes of two women conversing about memory. As the video progresses, subjects disappear into the “no space” gluing the two images together.\" -The Studio Museum in Harlem","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3277752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorna Simpson","original_name":"Lorna Simpson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61700e4ec8f85800434bfc90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
