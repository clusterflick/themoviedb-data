She would later describe her method as “fragments of reality assembled in an unusual manner”.","popularity":0.0634,"poster_path":"/xplFh1DV6lsgjiqse7hfT0MIPjP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlinfever – Wolf Vostell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wolf Vostell","original_name":"Wolf Vostell","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"65915c9f028f147745c58d96","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrike Ottinger","original_name":"Ulrike Ottinger","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/4mhoFrgqnqwJCaqTSSgANClrfAL.jpg","credit_id":"616f4a5f160e730029872e5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrike Ottinger","original_name":"Ulrike Ottinger","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/4mhoFrgqnqwJCaqTSSgANClrfAL.jpg","credit_id":"66ac8abf59bab78db70b4173","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.74,"height":1509,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xplFh1DV6lsgjiqse7hfT0MIPjP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1117}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
