In that brief duration of time which coincided with the global pandemic, he had to move between three completely different housing setups - a subletting situation, the cheapest AirBnB in town and eventually a student house. As much as the film is an intimate glimpse of the filmmaker`s encounters with various people, places and memories while away from home, it also becomes a fleeting document of the various quirks of cohabitation in Belgium when looked at from an outsider’s point of view.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/37X7FccTlkKfFJlLFNRZEqGZlIA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Assamese","iso_639_1":"as","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“I arrived in Ghent in 2019 to do my masters in audio-visual arts.
