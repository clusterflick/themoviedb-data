Each episode profiles the influence of radical Marxists on various segments of American society. With President Trump executing missile strikes in Syria and radical Islamic terrorism being as big a threat as it ever has been, we need to understand how these oppressive regimes and extremist ideologies got started and empowered. Working with Dangerous Documentaries, director Judd Saul and conservative commentator Trevor Loudon have compiled a team of researchers who have uncovered the history of the Soviet Union's meddling in Middle Eastern politics, creating a new enemy for the United States, and learned that Russia's continuing alliance with Islamists is forwarding a radical domestic threat in America today.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/oiHpHSIZNGR4uGR5atZE5ZCfyF7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America Under Siege: Soviet Islam","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6820036","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oncGjAa2I3ETnZJrNZ9fWrDfvNc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oiHpHSIZNGR4uGR5atZE5ZCfyF7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
