He kept his sight memory, though. After many years, he comes back, both in person and in memories to his childhood places, the colours and shapes which he still vividly remembers. Starting from descriptions of rooms and furniture, he delves deeper, into feelings, passions, hopes and frustrations. In a combined visual and tactile film essay on the ability of perceiving the invisible details, looking back at his life, he asks the question, along with the filmmaker Lina Zacher, to what extent one’s identity is created by images. Can one understand oneself and one’s surroundings, finding one’s place in the society without actually seeing where one is?","popularity":0.0587,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Betula Pendula","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Wellner","original_name":"Thomas Wellner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61708ebd6d4c97006538c173","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465435,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lina Zacher","original_name":"Lina Zacher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61708ec5fd7aa400660d215a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2021-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
