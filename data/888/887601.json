Separated by America’s hemispheres, one in Brazil and the other in the U.S, they communicate strictly through video letters during a year. As a rule, each letter is formally and thematically inspired by a woman experimental filmmaker. As life unfolds, they express on film what they want to share with each other: the experience of being a recent immigrant, the expectations of political elections in both countries, their fears and hopes, all while observing the different women around them.","popularity":0.136,"poster_path":"/bKdlULKRDmC6iwjJWthgXJi1nCC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130077,"logo_path":"/e3wIhHj6U5wstsnHJSQb1mgtkkM.png","name":"Vulcana Cinema","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swing and Sway","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2418246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nava Mau","original_name":"Nava Mau","popularity":0.4266,"profile_path":"/u8cS0PxTVnNJQeWItZdcr6JxrBs.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6635a1af99d5c3012c57e8d9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1499697,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paola Wink","original_name":"Paola Wink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628515f61f3e600067bd39e4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1650604,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jessica Luz","original_name":"Jessica Luz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628515e69ca75916457d2da4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1771085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernanda Pessoa","original_name":"Fernanda Pessoa","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/pG0RJtEhHPaBT0AQdSOErCS2sS3.jpg","credit_id":"62967806ca83541353b3be50","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1771085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernanda Pessoa","original_name":"Fernanda Pessoa","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/pG0RJtEhHPaBT0AQdSOErCS2sS3.jpg","credit_id":"6296780d9defda009c1c31e2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1775280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adriana Barbosa","original_name":"Adriana Barbosa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qCxEJnkqX9bvXBHmMrajqaVBrK2.jpg","credit_id":"629677fd7e12f00065351ed1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1775280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adriana Barbosa","original_name":"Adriana Barbosa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qCxEJnkqX9bvXBHmMrajqaVBrK2.jpg","credit_id":"629677f7a44d0900511418bd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1775280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adriana Barbosa","original_name":"Adriana Barbosa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qCxEJnkqX9bvXBHmMrajqaVBrK2.jpg","credit_id":"61704a5f176a940023ad8756","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1771085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernanda Pessoa","original_name":"Fernanda Pessoa","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/pG0RJtEhHPaBT0AQdSOErCS2sS3.jpg","credit_id":"61704a68176a9400853386fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15532686","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2828,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bKdlULKRDmC6iwjJWthgXJi1nCC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1886}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"14","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Montreal International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2022-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOK Leipzig","release_date":"2022-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
