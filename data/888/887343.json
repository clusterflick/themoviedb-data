Recollecting their past home, which now exists only in old VHS tapes, Luka and Željko take a trip down memory lane, while also setting out on a path to discovering what the future holds for them. As they connect the dots of their family tree, a mash-up of very different characters is introduced, including a book-van librarian, an old farmer, a John Malkovich double from Croatia, and people from all over the world whose last name is Malković. But, digging up one’s family history always carries a certain risk – will father and son lose their relationship while trying to improve it?","popularity":0.0502,"poster_path":"/mYMZVPe57ZEappzBidzEPFPpLdA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Being Related to John Malkovich","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3277292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luka Mavretić","original_name":"Luka Mavretić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616f7c4cdf86a80023e646ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3277292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luka Mavretić","original_name":"Luka Mavretić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cc090b61c548935d104d09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4904782,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Valentina Mavretić","original_name":"Valentina Mavretić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cc091b2e76dab3ef0ec6e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1601581,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anita Juka","original_name":"Anita Juka","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cc093b2bb266ce3ed08852","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mYMZVPe57ZEappzBidzEPFPpLdA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":571}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
