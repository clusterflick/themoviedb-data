Baltic German engineer Gunnar Haase, initially a refugee, arrived in Finnish Lapland in 1945 to repair the destruction left by the Germans. Antti’s father Hannu continued grandfather Gunnar’s mission to bring electricity to Lapland – the powerlines finally reaching the very last Lapland home on the 23th July,1987. Rural electrification was an enormous undertaking; it brought modern life and equality to people still living in the harsh nature. And while the undertaking took a heavy toll, it also illuminated the way forward. The Illuminators is an inspiring story about courage and social progress as well as sons following in their father’s footsteps.","popularity":0.0767,"poster_path":"/tgjK6VMtlEmMLqJpZrSulxqRjiy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33385,"logo_path":"/mwYzhJn7rRNr6cb695jJET72EoT.png","name":"Illume","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2017-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of a Baltic German refugee who became Lapland’s father of light","title":"The Illuminators","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antti Haase","original_name":"Antti Haase","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"616fd6f9160e7300618668a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3277569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gunnar Haase","original_name":"Gunnar Haase","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"616fd70f160e7300618668ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3277570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannu Haase","original_name":"Hannu Haase","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"616fd71ad4b9d9008a7abec5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antti Haase","original_name":"Antti Haase","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616fd3a3160e730043252fbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antti Haase","original_name":"Antti Haase","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616fd3b6894ed600232dde52","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8736048","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Valontuojat","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"fi","file_path":"/vEKJ5685Aig4fVSXBXYT008s4El.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tgjK6VMtlEmMLqJpZrSulxqRjiy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"S","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"Sodankylän elokuvajuhlat","release_date":"2017-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"S","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"Rovaniemi (Arktikumin Polarium-sali)","release_date":"2017-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"S","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"Yle TV1","release_date":"2019-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
