In the summer of 1957, four-year-old Gaby came from West Berlin to Sandefjord, where she was to spend the summer with an unknown family. Gaby was one of around 70,000 German children sent to Norway and Sweden in the post-war period, as part of an attempt to create reconciliation in a continent that was still strongly affected by the worst war in human history. But even if the intention was good, the stays in Norway were not exclusively positive for the German children.","popularity":0.0711,"poster_path":"/xlmmY85xtwO32jvn09Bfbv63M6P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162864,"logo_path":null,"name":"Puffin Film","origin_country":""},{"id":172088,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bry film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They came from distress and poverty to reconcile in Europe.","title":"Sommerbarna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3276424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linn Helene Løken","original_name":"Linn Helene Løken","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"623a459e4f3a4c005cba787f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3476395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabrielle Husby Eiken","original_name":"Gabrielle Husby Eiken","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"623a45acac617c005d6b6c6f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3476414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Collinet","original_name":"Barbara Collinet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"623a48c14f3a4c005cba8157","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3476415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helga Ernst Eichhorn","original_name":"Helga Ernst Eichhorn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"623a48dda34911005dc01578","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3276424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linn Helene Løken","original_name":"Linn Helene Løken","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623a45c784448e005cd9f84d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986315,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hanne Hukkelberg","original_name":"Hanne Hukkelberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623a4934945c20004a683c7f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2937976,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Linn Heidi Slåttøy","original_name":"Linn Heidi Slåttøy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623a491dac617c005d6b78e4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3276424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linn Helene Løken","original_name":"Linn Helene Løken","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616eb5ace004a60086f383c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2695273,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Frida Marie Flatland","original_name":"Frida Marie Flatland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616eb655ba131b0029a670e4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3276427,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guro Sollie Hansebakken","original_name":"Guro Sollie Hansebakken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616eb5d9bf09d100445ace98","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3276431,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christer Sev","original_name":"Christer Sev","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616eb615160e73004322ec1a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xlmmY85xtwO32jvn09Bfbv63M6P.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1058,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5n0by17Y73DPwhmXH4bwMwR6ccL.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":704}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"no","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
