At the beginning, we see in detail a small wolf cub that some people found abandoned in a forest and are now taking to a rescue station by car. Then pure observational methods are used to develop the light-hearted story of two such wolves during their forced stay in captivity until such time that they are returned to the wild. The structure of the film is based only on the changing times of day and yearly seasons. Everything else is open to the viewer’s interpretation of animal behavior, chiefly during the wolves’ interaction with other representatives of their own species and in both familiar and unknown surroundings.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7tXTfXjRPUQ5gxb0l2kIaGAvIL6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Connection","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2302368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Dalpian","original_name":"Andrea Dalpian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61709798cadb6b008aec0bc5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7tXTfXjRPUQ5gxb0l2kIaGAvIL6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"70.
