Each channel not only reflects the other but also correlates to it: one woman's exit signals the other's entrance, thus making each image dependent upon the other. While the women's homes, dress, and technological access reveal a century's worth of creature-comfort advances, the two scenes emphasize the continuities of their moments over what might be the expected narrative of racial progress in the hundred years following the end of slavery.\" -Thomas J.
