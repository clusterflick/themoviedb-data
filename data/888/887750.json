An opportunity to talk about the freedom, loneliness and hope of women who, although incarcerated, keep their dreams alive.\"  Adopting the semi-open prison regime, a penitentiary in São Paulo allows inmates to work outside. According to the psychologists of the establishment - who during the film talk about the scientific level and the practical results of their work - this system is seen and developed as a fair achievement of the inmates and not as a privilege, gradually ensuring their social reintegration.
