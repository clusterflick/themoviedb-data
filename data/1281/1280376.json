He asks his son, Trevor, a small-town lawyer, to join as secretary. Trevor suspects foul play, warns his father, and returns to his practice after a disagreement. Lester, one of the promoters, woos and abandons his stenographer, Brenda Wray. When rumors surface about the mine’s instability, the promoters attempt to place blame on Lawlor. Knowing he holds documents to clear his name, they bribe his servant to steal them. Brenda, seeking justice from Lester, overhears the plan and informs Trevor. Lawlor’s servant, Thompson, is caught, confesses, and clears Lawlor’s name, leading to the arrest of Harris, Brennen, and Lester.","popularity":0.2528,"poster_path":"/1lB8vEO249oipmH0TuEDa4h0muH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Spider's Web","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Costello","original_name":"Maurice Costello","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/92Q6cg7efdgMrmNbGNXBoF2hrpB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Trevor Lawlor - A Young Attorney","credit_id":"662b5096b513a8011e3f051d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Eldridge","original_name":"Charles Eldridge","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/wOUeM12wbwojgDwAzG7srl6qnuh.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Graham Lawlor - Trevor's Father","credit_id":"662b50ab501cf2011cb38b14","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van Dyke Brooke","original_name":"Van Dyke Brooke","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/srLqffFE7o3SrBJPFwf9zLRb5g8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Harris - A Swindler","credit_id":"662b50be175051011d78cfe7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1358772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earle Williams","original_name":"Earle Williams","popularity":0.109,"profile_path":"/h8NOjETlZvKzVeRp5uAalEoPOu3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lester - A Swindler","credit_id":"662b51345c071b011d5e8c28","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Wilson","original_name":"Hal Wilson","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/o6v1TNGi5YqDeayaAB3UshIb8xF.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Brennan - A Swindler","credit_id":"662b51436e0d72011e1f9316","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leah Baird","original_name":"Leah Baird","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/sa3dtkd3jbAZ9KHOSrxtGWGF8HK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Brenda Wray - Lester's Stenographer","credit_id":"662b51536e0d72011e1f9325","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zena Keefe","original_name":"Zena Keefe","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":"/x5XhNYSr3r7YtU0ycVLC5N1HvQ8.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"662b5160e8d0b4011e1154f7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1391868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Shea","original_name":"William Shea","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/Ag5IBOVM6UhMnSjsSMoZWLGb80V.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"662b516cc1ffbd011c6c0923","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van Dyke Brooke","original_name":"Van Dyke Brooke","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/srLqffFE7o3SrBJPFwf9zLRb5g8.jpg","credit_id":"662b5060e8d0b4011e115472","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Costello","original_name":"Maurice Costello","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/92Q6cg7efdgMrmNbGNXBoF2hrpB.jpg","credit_id":"662b5072501cf2011cb38af8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0222386","wikidata_id":"Q17499924","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":902,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5VQhwvogePmx3zgTtI5zZG1Y6Uj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1603}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1755,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1lB8vEO249oipmH0TuEDa4h0muH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1170}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1912-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
