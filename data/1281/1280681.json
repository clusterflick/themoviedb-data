They live with the shore, speaking through their instruments and microphones about the traditions they cherish and the love of their homeland. Their music provides a space for the film to explore, encompassing both the historical depth and cultural characteristics of the local civilization, and paying homage to the people, the sea, and the land that exists here. Here, music not only flows with sheer beauty and passion, but is also the language that unites people.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":"/xWeNtTmy29H9m7BHbRQOunmtLCE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Una Comunión","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":231968,"logo_path":null,"name":"B.H.D.
