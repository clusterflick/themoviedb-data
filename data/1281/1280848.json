However, this line of thought leaves her paralyzed in a state of indifference to everything. She acts out of routine more than impulse. Her coffee goes cold sitting in front of her, her toast burns. There is only one vision of peace, one space of silence - the end. Even when a friend calls her out Anna cannot focus on the interaction instead the noise of the cafe, the brightness of the day more and more assert her belief that the only way out is to leave. Sitting alone at home with a final parting retort to the world via social media a surprise phone call from her mother could be the only thing that pulls her from the gloom.","popularity":0.1728,"poster_path":"/i962oVml6YjYh5FB8dS4hmp0mNX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Candid Broads Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A short film about loneliness and melancholy.","title":"Poles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3257653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oriane Pick","original_name":"Oriane Pick","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"662c6a29511d090121c49b02","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2337335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Leong","original_name":"Jennifer Leong","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kim","credit_id":"662c70c2a199a6012b71f095","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":107242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Faulkner","original_name":"Sally Faulkner","popularity":0.1242,"profile_path":"/kZcqmDXFzw6zQcH6bwqvSdHUEzR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mum","credit_id":"662c6a8460c751012964397d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3257653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oriane Pick","original_name":"Oriane Pick","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662c70fd24f2ce01262a14bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677742,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stephen J.
