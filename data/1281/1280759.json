The American media had led an outpouring of shock and grief in the United States at the death of the heroic president. All the western leaders then travelled to Cairo to say goodbye to the man who had courageously changed the course of history.  But then they found that practically no Egyptians turned up to the funeral. And the western politicians and the American TV reporters couldn't understand why.  The documentary tries to find the answer.","popularity":0.4426,"poster_path":"/A13HD9ilkrJeGttem0u5F68hKq4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why
