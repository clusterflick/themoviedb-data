Twenty frames were sampled from each minute of Ince's 40-minute film. The software takes each sampled minute and dynamically extends it to one hour, choosing its own rescaling and translation movements that dynamically reframe the images.  The band of data along the bottom of the frame indicates the actual local time-of-viewing the software-driven display (but not this recorded documentation). The band of data also displays the most recent inter-title from Thomas Ince's narrative film. The inter-titles change as the software proceeds through the 40-hour generative display of frames from the 1912 film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/la8s6OKGloQXKHqSeXQaHhysz5X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recording of ODE applied to The Invaders, Hour 18: Sky Star Overhears the Plan to Resist the Invaders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2816767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Lattanzi","original_name":"Barbara Lattanzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/77CdlZCkzTs2ZmJpZzCNNqTnMbx.jpg","credit_id":"662bebcd6c19ea01251e04af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/la8s6OKGloQXKHqSeXQaHhysz5X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Recording of ODE applied to The Invaders,  Hour 18:  Sky Star Overhears the Plan to Resist the Invaders","key":"263673948","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-04-07T20:19:39.000Z","id":"662beb4e1065d30124b301c9"}]}}}
