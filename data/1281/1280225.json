Nevertheless, as I traversed the path of my upbringing, I found myself harboring reservations about the names bestowed upon me. These names elicited within me a complex blend of emotions, from identity quandaries to bewilderment, from moments of regret to wellsprings of joy. At certain junctures along my life's journey, I even contemplated relinquishing my original name in favor of a new one. However, a profound realization dawned upon me: my name serves as the indelible thread that binds me to my past, shaping the person I was and the person I have become. Names are not merely labels but precious gifts, each one bearing a unique significance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Please Call Me...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4674929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rui Wang","original_name":"Rui Wang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662ab895b54002011e03d8ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
