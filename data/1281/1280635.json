No part of the process is overlooked: plants are ground into a range of colorful dyes, sheep are sheared and their wool spun into yarn, which is then plunged into enormous dye baths, plans for the next intricate pattern are diligently designed, rhythmic weaving turns string into mat, and a beautiful artifact takes shape before our eyes. In this pure visual treat, stunning cinematography and an ambient soundscape come together to celebrate handmade work in an age of mass-production.","popularity":0.0984,"poster_path":"/vNXwpqFfUpgZRfVP9oJDiSEtDYQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Poot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3221189,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Elham Asadi","original_name":"Elham Asadi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662be309a806730122574971","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3221189,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Elham Asadi","original_name":"Elham Asadi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662be31a1f02750125eb364f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1930131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iman Tahsin","original_name":"Iman Tahsin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662be32820e6a50125924422","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4676821,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kamyar Minoukadeh","original_name":"Kamyar Minoukadeh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662be343d4fe0401284fcde9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xUDfZofSI2ztZbrOIfeY8FQv2V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1052,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vNXwpqFfUpgZRfVP9oJDiSEtDYQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Amsterdam International Documentary Films Festival","release_date":"2009-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
