They are stories born from the tumultuous dynamics of their migrations and the restless coexistence of their cultures in contact. They tell with their own voice the small great conflict of living crossing those borders in everyday life. The subtle and permanent tension between nationality and identity, in an audiovisual essay on daily life on the Argentine-Brazilian border. A wide river -the Uruguay- that runs between the two countries does not stop a long history of common experiences, despite official efforts to establish national differences at the border. There, language becomes emblematic every time a local - no matter which side of the border - speaks “portuñol”, a hybrid variety of Spanish and Portuguese.","popularity":0.0623,"poster_path":"/4MjG6B1uZ7OLYOxPN6aYB0xznmI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6458,"logo_path":"/eT4oMUK7ODM0vvZue8yq3Ojwqf8.png","name":"INCAA","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2002-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Mixture of Life","title":"Mixtura de Vida","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4675380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Osmar Bornes","original_name":"Osmar Bornes","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"el mismo","credit_id":"662b0096501cf2011eb359d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4675381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariano De Lima","original_name":"Mariano De Lima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"narrador","credit_id":"662b00eb95ce24011f60c256","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3683371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Zanotti","original_name":"Ana Zanotti","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662aff50323eba011f3edb64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3683371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Zanotti","original_name":"Ana Zanotti","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662aff6ef9183a011f30d4f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2712634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Rodas","original_name":"Daniel Rodas","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662afff3b54002011b03fe91","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4675379,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Humberto Carrizo","original_name":"Humberto Carrizo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662b0033b54002011e03fa9c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3683371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Zanotti","original_name":"Ana Zanotti","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662b011b9ac535011e8ef7d4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4675385,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hugo Dartois","original_name":"Hugo Dartois","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662b014b95ce24012060c55d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.746,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/4MjG6B1uZ7OLYOxPN6aYB0xznmI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":746}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ATP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"9° Festival Latinoamericano Video Rosario, Argentina","release_date":"2002-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
