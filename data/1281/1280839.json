Varnishing Day meant there were no more changes, the work was complete. Now the word has come to mean \"the opening of an art exhibition\" or a \"private viewing\"...here, vernissage is a glimpse into the creative lives of American artists (World War Two veterans) who came to study and work in Paris, the art capital of the world.  World War Two Veterans studied art in Paris during the 1950's. They formed Gallery Eight, which became the showcase for the artwork. Carmen D'Avino filmed these artists in Paris in 1950 for his silent documentary 'Vernissage.'  Transferred to video, and enhanced with a classical soundtrack and introduction notes in 2002.  Featuring Jonah Kinigstein, Sidney Geist, Oscar Chelimsky, Norman Rubington, John Anderson, Shinkicki Tajiri, and Herbert Katzman.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1950-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vernissage of American Artists","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4680630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinkichi Tajiri","original_name":"Shinkichi Tajiri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"662e750b60c751012664e624","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1126628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmen D'Avino","original_name":"Carmen D'Avino","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662c639169d28001294247aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
