Her grandfather, Henry Lee Jackson, a former Marine and Air Force master sergeant, sets the backdrop with his storied career and recognition with the Congressional Gold Medal. Despite initial reservations, the protagonist finds her calling in the military, embarking on a journey that takes her from ROTC in college to challenging assignments abroad, including a pivotal role in Afghanistan and enriching experiences in South Korea. Along the way, she confronts the complexities of advancing in a field still grappling with issues of race and gender, reflecting on the progress made since her grandfather's time and the work that remains. Through her story, we explore themes of duty, courage, and the ongoing struggle for equality, all while honoring the family's enduring commitment to serving their country.","popularity":0.2882,"poster_path":"/7j54JaAwYnwsMfI2PMxUqo6YUkC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A young woman defies her own expectations to continue her family's storied military legacy, facing challenges of race and gender while honoring the past and shaping her own path in service to her country.","title":"Generations of Service: The LaShaunda Jackson Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"LaShaunda Jackson","original_name":"LaShaunda Jackson","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"LaShaunda Jackson","credit_id":"662c27a595665801281e1a17","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665340,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexis Cabrera","original_name":"Alexis Cabrera","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662c25a995665801231e1939","department":"Crew","job":"Digital Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
