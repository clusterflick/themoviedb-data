Adhering to the original Orthodox Christian dogma and rituals introduced to ancient Rus (present-day Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia) by the Greeks of Byzantium, the Old Believers see themselves as the last Christians left on the face of the Earth. Here in North America, for the first time in their history, they are threatened not by persecution, but by economic bounty and the western notion of personal freedom. Shot over the four seasons, the film is both a beautiful rendering of timeless rituals and a fascinating exploration of the Old Believers' turbulent history.","popularity":0.0792,"poster_path":"/nLui6lkHLmj6hZJPrl6wLCFJKJu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Old Believers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":947450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Paskievich","original_name":"John Paskievich","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662c040a2c6b7b012755ac91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223830","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nLui6lkHLmj6hZJPrl6wLCFJKJu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
