An anthem that has become a part of ourselves and of music history. My Way is one of the most covered songs in the world, from Sid Vicious to Tom Jones, from Nina Simone to Pavarotti. Yet many people are unaware that it was conceived in France, by the pool of Claude François' private hotel, in the summer of 1967, and that a succession of chance encounters and sleepless nights guided it across the Atlantic to the man who was to make it a legend. Like a biopic, this documentary recounts the birth of a myth and how a song entered the pantheon of pop culture.","popularity":1.7165,"poster_path":"/8PZTdb1gj8b6BVo54yvITotF56z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90667,"logo_path":null,"name":"High Sea Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One Song.
