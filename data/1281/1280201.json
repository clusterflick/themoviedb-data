But this is no new golden age. The eternal struggle for resources remains, pitting the water-starved Empire of Mars against our species’ home planet. The Second Great War has raged for decades. Kai’s father has fallen in battle, his mother gone missing on a mission to Saturn. Now 18 years old, Kai is determined to do his part (and find his mother), and follows in his father’s footsteps to the Mecha Corps Academy. Though brilliant in theoretical matters, Kai is physically weak, and hides the asthma that would disqualify him. With the support of his squad—overachiever Waye, easygoing Ean, neurotic Ren, and the sympathetic if incomprehensible brute Rock—Kai earns his place at the controls of his own mecha, which he names Little Dragon. So begins the deep bond between Kai and his robot, which will need to be strong as steel if either will survive the incredible challenges ahead.","popularity":0.2447,"poster_path":"/iUnHR9ZnqaeQAwlXnCs7TvFj7pj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2024-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Never alone, never give up","title":"Heavens: The Boy and His Robot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Mechaverse: Shonen to Robotto","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4822282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rich Ho","original_name":"Rich Ho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668e880c51b4c7bd8af0e66d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28501176","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iUnHR9ZnqaeQAwlXnCs7TvFj7pj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1728},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9YviILpRe3xxeVgsFLT875mrJsX.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fantasia International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fantasporto","release_date":"2025-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
