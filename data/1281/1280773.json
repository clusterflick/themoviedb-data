Though her movements were visible to the spectators, Jonas did not allow them to see the fragmented image reflected in the mirror.  As the artist recalls, “Mirror Check was inspired by the situation in the late 1960s and early ‘70s of the women’s movement and the idea of a woman reversing the gaze and claiming her body as her own.”  First performed as part of Mirror Piece II (1970), the work was subsequently documented on its own and created into its own film.
