Ninety Six in the 1700s was a land of hope and opportunity, of conflict and revenge, a land of frontier justice. This was the site of violent struggles between Cherokee and settlers and among settlers themselves - those loyal to the King pitted against \"Patriots\" for freedom.â€‚Ninety Six played a significant role in the struggle for American independence from British rule. It was the site of the first southern land battle of the Revolutionary War in 1775, and the scene of the longest field siege in 1781.","popularity":0.2768,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":173057,"logo_path":null,"name":"Great Divide Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ninety Six: Crossroads of a Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trace Adkins","original_name":"Trace Adkins","popularity":0.5705,"profile_path":"/9MMbYFI0WL2rp5iQG9DeYL0Pgvl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"662aeb0eb54002011b03e06f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4662015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Koopman III","original_name":"John Koopman III","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Andrew Pickens","credit_id":"662b26e7b513a8011e3ef095","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Pagano","original_name":"John Pagano","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"John Cruger","credit_id":"662b271fe8d0b4011e113aa9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4675533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Treese","original_name":"Ken Treese","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nathanael Greene","credit_id":"662b2749c1ffbd011e6bfba6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4675536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Wellborn","original_name":"Christopher Wellborn","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Andrew Willamson","credit_id":"662b277595ce24011f60d85f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Wissinger","original_name":"Charles Wissinger","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Thaddeus Kosciusko","credit_id":"662b2793175051011c78bff3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4675537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warren Privott","original_name":"Warren Privott","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Henry Haldane","credit_id":"662b27aa3d7454011ed21597","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7924922","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
