The short film examines the landscape of Palestinian activism in Seattle particularly as it is in dialogue with the corporate environment which is oftentimes guilty of the very crimes so many of the Seattle people protest. Additionally, we examine the complex relationships of pro-Palestinian employees at pro-Israel companies and the internal affairs of such Seattle based companies in regards to Palestine so as to better understand Seattle's both direct and indirect involvement in Israel.","popularity":0.0724,"poster_path":"/gjCPW55BLh2qPLsJNwxT7N3tOMR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No Tech For Apartheid!","title":"From The River To The Sea To The Puget Sound","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maddy","original_name":"Maddy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"662ca59b60c7510123644e19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marwan","original_name":"Marwan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"662ca5a9511d090124c4b3f8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Abbas Kadhim","original_name":"Ali Abbas Kadhim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662ca4be24f2ce01202a3a38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677994,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mohamed Ahmed Khalfalla","original_name":"Mohamed Ahmed Khalfalla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662ca4e68a88b2012acdc532","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Abbas Kadhim","original_name":"Ali Abbas Kadhim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662ca4d0c3aa3f0129fcab53","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/shb1weaBGeLxiIWEt86AhoZRvxy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/gjCPW55BLh2qPLsJNwxT7N3tOMR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"From The River To The Sea Trailer","key":"939898345","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-04-27T07:14:30.000Z","id":"662ca659a806730128e82345"}]}}}
