The camera slowly zooms in on him, assuming his position and action, so that the viewer, too, experiences dizziness. The video is largely silent; the only sound effects are chirping birds, suggesting salvation, and rumbling aircraft, evoking imminent danger. The piece ends exactly where it commenced, avoiding any clear pronouncement regarding the boyâ€™s motivation or his fate.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/knfhEc2GE0vgiAKMfxmh9PMX798.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4674902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lida Abdul","original_name":"Lida Abdul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662ab5dd95ce24011e60a3a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":875,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/knfhEc2GE0vgiAKMfxmh9PMX798.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":583}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
