One among them transforms into the beautiful human Odette and he is immediately enamoured. But Odette is bound by a spell which keeps her captive as a swan during the day. Can Siegfried free her?  Tchaikovsky’s sensational score combines with the evocative imagination of choreographer Liam Scarlett and designer John Macfarlane to heighten the dramatic pathos of Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov’s quintessential ballet classic. Opening in Spring and returning in Summer, Swan Lake remains to this day one of the best-loved works in the classical ballet canon.","popularity":0.0729,"poster_path":"/q5FdAeQzcqEWKVpcSTzUqaC5OKT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":210,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live in Cinemas: Swan Lake","title":"Swan Lake - Live from the Royal Ballet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Ball","original_name":"Matthew Ball","popularity":0.2883,"profile_path":"/k2uWLdUrMzAylzoT8XffJnnLjNN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Prince","credit_id":"662a7843d18b24009ede2421","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasmine Naghdi","original_name":"Yasmine Naghdi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/u52cswFHnSIc5x9IFgUrvJmHdnm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Swan","credit_id":"662a784dde11e5009a70fea8","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iDoU9sFge2xMqRWvxsUndTsS9Jl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q5FdAeQzcqEWKVpcSTzUqaC5OKT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":524}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Royal Ballet: Swan Lake cinema trailer","key":"ITU241Ypino","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-04-09T15:47:49.000Z","id":"662a78a5de11e5009a70fec4"}]}}}
