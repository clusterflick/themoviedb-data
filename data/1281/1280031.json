Backpacking gave me the time and space to think—for hours and days and months—about what I wanted for myself and who I wanted to be. There is a saying: the trail provides. Here it is, providing me with the lesson that it was never about the destination, it was always about the journey. The PCT is a place of utter wonderment, sheer emotions, and a chaos that makes me feel like time itself has broken open.  Thank you to my family, friends, the PCTA and all the trail angels who have supported me along this adventure.
