In 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Lisbon’s largest sports centre is repurposed into an emergency shelter for people experiencing homelessness. Guided by Teresa, the project’s director, a temporary and self-organised community emerges, restoring a culture of care and mutual support. In a society on the edge of collapse, the residents find a voice and a sense of belonging. The film follows the journey of Tiago and Plácido, two committed friends, as they navigate the everyday turmoil in the hope of a new beginning.","popularity":0.2747,"poster_path":"/hFCFKdKq4q426GT5JBLPg17KZ7Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2024-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Placido N/A","original_name":"Placido N/A","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"662c0277a1c59d012d282b79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Maria Bispo","original_name":"Teresa Maria Bispo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"662c02812c6b7b012455ab9b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiago N/A","original_name":"Tiago N/A","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"662c02864a2226012258cb4b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zsófia Paczolay","original_name":"Zsófia Paczolay","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662c02c066362701274640a9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zsófia Paczolay","original_name":"Zsófia Paczolay","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662c02b6cb5c8e012861a4a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dorian Rivière","original_name":"Dorian Rivière","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662c02ce62e86f0126910668","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dorian Rivière","original_name":"Dorian Rivière","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662c02d3663627012d463ff9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiago Hespanha","original_name":"Tiago Hespanha","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662c02df62e86f01239107bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32490148","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/hFCFKdKq4q426GT5JBLPg17KZ7Q.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Doclisboa","release_date":"2024-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
