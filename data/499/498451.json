The performance centred on an unedited tape made by Jamal al-Sati, a fighter for Lebanon’s National Resistance Front. This shows three ‘takes’ of his martyr testimony rather than the approved version that was aired on Lebanese television. The three ‘takes’ allowed Mroué and Khoury to question the status of suicide videos and martyr posters, and to examine the ideological circumstances surrounding their production and place within the visual culture and political history of Lebanon.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/djTzi74XCTFtLrCdKqzU9dbX78N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Three Posters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rabih Mroué","original_name":"Rabih Mroué","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5b968cc3a368680d0222b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1279,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/djTzi74XCTFtLrCdKqzU9dbX78N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
