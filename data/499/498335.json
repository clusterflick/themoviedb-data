It is important to note that intersex conditions sometimes involve \"ambiguous genitalia\" but that intersexuality is not always evident from an external examination. Intersexuality may be caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia, mixed gonadal dysgenesis, androgen insensitivity syndrome (complete or partial), 5-alpha reductase deficiency, and many others. The traditonal standard of care held that normal gender identity could be assigned through genital plastic surgery and by limiting information given to parents and patient. Many patients were subjected to multiple surgeries.  This film outlines the problems with many current practices and provides guidelines for a new standard of care that is more advanced scientifically and ethically.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ocq0pRNdRCKl3tMxTjwalmpGAMk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Total Patient Care: The Child with an Intersex Condition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"First Do No Harm","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1959613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phyllis Ward","original_name":"Phyllis Ward","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5aef789251413f65017a22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0431685","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ocq0pRNdRCKl3tMxTjwalmpGAMk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
