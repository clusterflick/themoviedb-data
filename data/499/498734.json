Her work renders it in its subjective aspect by documenting the realities and narratives of migration, offering an alternative mapping based on the personal testimony of clandestine migrations. Mapping Journeys is a series of documentary works telling eight stories. Each presents a static shot of a map of the territory concerned, on which the traveller's hand sketches his or her journey. The accompanying voice has no face, as clandestinity requires: testimony to the invisibility of those at home nowhere and to the loss of identity this brings.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mapping journey n°4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1797176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bouchra Khalili","original_name":"Bouchra Khalili","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/zI1iAch9ohq3Bk257Iq5TrsWJlZ.jpg","credit_id":"5a5cf79dc3a36842c10000f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
