She has seen it all done it all but a black hole of emptiness engulfs her entire being. She tries to commit suicide but ends up alive and caught in a strange but beautiful journey, which oscillates between reality and fantasy. On this wonderland trip she meets different characters, who enhance her outlook, give variety to her experience and make this external exploration trip a journey of self-discovery. First she meets a living man who believes he is dead due to suffering from Cotard delusion, then a religious man who is sure about the superiority of his way, and an outlaw claiming to know the real truth. With the living man claiming to be dead she experiences a spectrum of previously unknown emotions and feelings. She puts her existence on stake to make this man alive again and discover new horizons.","popularity":0.594,"poster_path":"/88jZjv0yJc9wQpFuX2NiMRmVEbz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When illusions become reality","title":"The Dead End","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saidah Jules","original_name":"Saidah Jules","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Maya","credit_id":"65bb92c5c144dd0149fd9ed3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aditya Om","original_name":"Aditya Om","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Manu","credit_id":"65bb92da7646fd0163bd78bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zachary Coffin","original_name":"Zachary Coffin","popularity":0.3188,"profile_path":"/w49pHQwUJji8UFarpkuIiZRKVde.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Outlaw","credit_id":"65bb92ebcffeed0259aca58f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4512296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Narmadeshwar Dubey","original_name":"Narmadeshwar Dubey","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Monk","credit_id":"65bb9306d7cd060148532820","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4512297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shielly Shukla","original_name":"Shielly Shukla","popularity":0.1859,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Caretaker","credit_id":"65bb931611c0660162cfc2ef","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saidah Jules","original_name":"Saidah Jules","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb933811c0660162cfc2fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4152997,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Shrikant Asati","original_name":"Shrikant Asati","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb93d27646fd0184be1326","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aditya Om","original_name":"Aditya Om","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb92961fd36f017d72f809","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4512303,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mohammed Shaikh","original_name":"Mohammed Shaikh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb93a0459ad601616b97e8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1838997,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jamie Salisbury","original_name":"Jamie Salisbury","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb93c37646fd0184be131b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aditya Om","original_name":"Aditya Om","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb9287d7cd06017b53e916","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5175604","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/p7VkHMIubnwe2wSbCKS0UgZrqbl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/88jZjv0yJc9wQpFuX2NiMRmVEbz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.691,"height":768,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3ebYczOtw01tFjEfobnuf6ItLDD.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":236,"name":"suicide"},{"id":4662,"name":"illusion"},{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"},{"id":189092,"name":"journey"},{"id":198500,"name":"sickness"},{"id":287029,"name":"reality"},{"id":293198,"name":"fantasy"},{"id":328084,"name":"cotard delusion"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
