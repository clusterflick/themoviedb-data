For a time only their voices are heard, until they try to have some light, and open the door. The Woman takes an almost maternal role, they share a sandwich and a cigarette, discuss the contents of the closet, and then The Woman wonders if there is any sexual attraction between them. The Man is too shy for that, or to leave the closet.","popularity":0.1754,"poster_path":"/gTH4yhXf5MYIh3NR366U6IM5H0O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Closet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nico","original_name":"Nico","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/6VyjDb5du0kN0XshCn0l1nO4uRF.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"The Woman","credit_id":"5a5abbc89251413f65015146","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1959487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Borscheidt","original_name":"Randy Borscheidt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The Man","credit_id":"5a5abbdbc3a368680d01535f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Warhol","original_name":"Andy Warhol","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/4FwsJKGOpYcYwFqxFKnbl5bFx3Y.jpg","credit_id":"5a5abc000e0a265706013563","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Warhol","original_name":"Andy Warhol","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/4FwsJKGOpYcYwFqxFKnbl5bFx3Y.jpg","credit_id":"5a5abbf99251413f77016059","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Warhol","original_name":"Andy Warhol","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/4FwsJKGOpYcYwFqxFKnbl5bFx3Y.jpg","credit_id":"5ace3646c3a36834de09d99f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0375664","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gTH4yhXf5MYIh3NR366U6IM5H0O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
