After the closure of a major municipal landfill site in 2015, thousands of tons of rubbish clogged the streets of Beirut. This led to public outcry, protests and accusations of government corruption. Since the 1990s, in the years following the end of the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut has been rapidly reshaped by property developers. Using strategically placed rubbish dumps, the surrounding land is devalued and left open for redevelopment. The aftermath of this process is the subject of the film, a portrait of a contested urban environment that connects the crisis with the city’s property boom.","popularity":0.0504,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falling Is Not Collapsing, Falling Is Extending","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1427190,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marwa Arsanios","original_name":"Marwa Arsanios","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/pxYoHAp9TrWi86ocUDtl0AOB2Bs.jpg","credit_id":"5a5a1a1dc3a36867d600b4b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1762833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karam Ghossein","original_name":"Karam Ghossein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eaada7ccc9683001eb13dae","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1756382,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rana Eid","original_name":"Rana Eid","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eaadab9e4c9eb001de3883b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1817083,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vartan Avakian","original_name":"Vartan Avakian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eaada9b07291c0025ed3042","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2619776,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katrin Ebersohn","original_name":"Katrin Ebersohn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eaadad6514c4a001f8dbb0c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2619776,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katrin Ebersohn","original_name":"Katrin Ebersohn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eaadae0945d36001e861e53","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
