Grikevicius's film is Tomas Petreikis, the chief engineer of the machine factory in Kaunas F. Dzeržinskis.

After work, Tom is an entertaining dancer, teacher and contest judge. \"Construction and dancing? No, they don't not have any relation,\" T. Petreikis answers the question posed by the journalist.
