The filmmaker has described “Time and Dreams” as a personal journey back to his Alabama home, where he contrasts two societies: the nostalgia some residents have for past values versus the deferred dreams of those who are well past waiting for their time to fully participate in the promise of their own dreams. Through vignettes and personal testimonies, the film portrays Greene County, Alabama, as its people move toward understanding and cooperation in a time of social change.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/nkbs2URkWIMs2iPljbaemtZHYOs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time and Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mort Jordan","original_name":"Mort Jordan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a594005c3a3686c22003378","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7784178","wikidata_id":"Q60197037","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nkbs2URkWIMs2iPljbaemtZHYOs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
