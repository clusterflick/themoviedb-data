They canoe east from Calgary towards the Prairies (the geography of Farley's Born Naked and Owls in the Family) and then traverse the same paths that Mowat took more than 60 years earlier in Never Cry Wolf and People of the Deer. Their epic 5,000 km journey—trekking, sailing, portaging and paddling—ends in the Maritimes, at Mowat's Nova Scotia summer home.","popularity":0.097,"poster_path":"/1HcNPJcpW1u3BZoe6dCt0CkfrMO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding Farley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056741,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leanne Allison","original_name":"Leanne Allison","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a5c410592514132320053e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karsten Heuer","original_name":"Karsten Heuer","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a5c411ec3a3686d7c004dae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386827,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Farley Mowat","original_name":"Farley Mowat","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61de6ad56743fa0068d69ddc","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056741,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leanne Allison","original_name":"Leanne Allison","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5c41410e0a260da3005873","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056741,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leanne Allison","original_name":"Leanne Allison","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5c41730e0a260d970056be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056741,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leanne Allison","original_name":"Leanne Allison","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5c41800e0a260d9a0057d7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karsten Heuer","original_name":"Karsten Heuer","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5c41960e0a260d9d00559c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1632073,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Michael Mann","original_name":"Michael Mann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5c41c60e0a260d9d0055d2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143101,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tracey Friesen","original_name":"Tracey Friesen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5c41d6c3a3686d7c004e37","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029850,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dennis Burke","original_name":"Dennis Burke","popularity":0.0786,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5c41f20e0a260da0005681","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1960314,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raphael Choi","original_name":"Raphael Choi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5c41ffc3a3686d7c004e59","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029849,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Janice Brown","original_name":"Janice Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5c420d0e0a260d9700574b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029850,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dennis Burke","original_name":"Dennis Burke","popularity":0.0786,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5c421d925141323b005491","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143101,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tracey Friesen","original_name":"Tracey Friesen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5c4229c3a3686d77005035","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1519307","wikidata_id":"Q5449938","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1HcNPJcpW1u3BZoe6dCt0CkfrMO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
