The camp, military style of Pakistans rescue teams, with their marching and theatrical disaster exercises are a world away from the relaxed beachside work of the Hawaiians who stop for ice-cream at every turn.  On the other side of the globe, above the romantic canals of Venice, ambulance doctors and nurses watch a generation of old Venetians quietly die as tourists pass below.  Meanwhile, Mexican paramedics put their mind off the terror of the countrys drug war with their on-station games and madcap antics.","popularity":0.4054,"poster_path":"/nTcaSCUJlArfrbuxrGySDOLAjBn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2012-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Around the world by Ambulance","title":"Paramedico","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961574,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alison Croft","original_name":"Alison Croft","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5ebea4c3a36838400021cf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961575,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"AJ True","original_name":"AJ True","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5ebf030e0a264d400023b3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1023318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Gilmour","original_name":"Benjamin Gilmour","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/fxwMVxFnk6k4U07wi2uLDF7gQFA.jpg","credit_id":"5b0e796c0e0a2671b4003a03","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1023318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Gilmour","original_name":"Benjamin Gilmour","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/fxwMVxFnk6k4U07wi2uLDF7gQFA.jpg","credit_id":"5b0e797592514153b70040d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1023318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Gilmour","original_name":"Benjamin Gilmour","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/fxwMVxFnk6k4U07wi2uLDF7gQFA.jpg","credit_id":"5b0e7987c3a36828780027c0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2324296","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.654,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nTcaSCUJlArfrbuxrGySDOLAjBn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":654}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1546,"name":"ambulance"},{"id":41603,"name":"paramedic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"MA15+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
