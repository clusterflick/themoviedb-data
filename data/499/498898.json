At a time when women barely left their parlour rooms, Marianne North's globetrotting exploits defied convention as she travelled alone at the height of the British Empire. From Borneo and Brazil to Japan, South Africa, Australia and India, she fearlessly navigated the world twice over in her pursuit of capturing every living plant on canvas.  Actress Emilia Fox tells the story of how this Victorian rebel changed the face of botanical research, propelling her to the top of a male-dominated world of science and exploration, gaining the admiration of Charles Darwin and even Queen Victoria. Retracing Marianne's footsteps and her passion for the natural world, Emilia revisits the awe-inspiring locations of some of her greatest experiences.","popularity":0.2143,"poster_path":"/mktFYTJeRIM3ZGXvZPyygI7TYRy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kew's Forgotten Queen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilia Fox","original_name":"Emilia Fox","popularity":1.3238,"profile_path":"/lZpNRsHAOW8m0f7bRfgUDmRRjo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself - Presenter","credit_id":"5ceaf76dc3a3681c4e21cb74","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irene Antoniades","original_name":"Irene Antoniades","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ceaf6f392514175e8bbe8be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mktFYTJeRIM3ZGXvZPyygI7TYRy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
