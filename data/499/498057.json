BUT IT SEEMS THAT 21ST CENTURY LIVING HAS BROUGHT ON ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES THAT COULD STRESS OUT EVEN THE MELLOWEST OF PEOPLE.  THE GOOD NEWS: Christians throughout the ages have struggled with stress, from Psalmists to Jeremiah to John Bunyan to Charles Spurgeon. You are not alone.  THE BETTER NEWS: There is a Biblical cure. Jesus is fully aware that we struggle with anxiety and He graciously preached a sermon just for the anxious Christian.  THE BEST NEWS: God will give you the power to overcome your anxiety. God has given us His Holy Spirit precisely for this struggle.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wretched Worldview - Anxiety","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1490340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Todd Friel","original_name":"Todd Friel","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/72IHNUhKXGSGqGjE1NzXQSoZFEO.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Host","credit_id":"5a593499c3a3686c16003250","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
