She struggles to reconnect with her husband on a sexual and emotional accord and begins to realise the distance between herself and her child as her daughter hides pivotal moments of puberty that a mother should be there to support. In the middle of moving out of their Service Family Accommodation, Jodie escapes to her one place of solace, a hotel where she resides to be free and remember the past. It is there she notices and becomes obsessed with a couple, an abusive older man and a young prostitute who he humiliates and debases. Following them back to their room, Jodie enters into the situation and it is through an extreme act of violence, lust and in her eyes 'protection' she has a revelation concerning what she has experienced and what has been haunting her deep within her cognisance.","popularity":0.2511,"poster_path":"/bP6QnUiMmrgrAEYOXngPyArTxdG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soldier Bee","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shauna Macdonald","original_name":"Shauna Macdonald","popularity":0.3936,"profile_path":"/37npPeVbx8ZZ0e54gs9JrrxAxoA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jodie","credit_id":"658dc158a3361259e4593cf9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Laird","original_name":"Jamie Laird","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/n4AkKUCW6JvvAevITgCQq1whAAf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Graham","credit_id":"658dc164fe6c186b0da6c086","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Newton","original_name":"George Newton","popularity":0.1951,"profile_path":"/5uuxFcMFRxo9dr9bDSz4cesjVwd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lars","credit_id":"658dc1752afb255f1d0ce8a4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4452389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katrina Ann Foster","original_name":"Katrina Ann Foster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Irena","credit_id":"658dc18420e6a557058b47e2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1960518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Hardy","original_name":"Alex Hardy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5cc9b70e0a261553000481","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4835318","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":993,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bP6QnUiMmrgrAEYOXngPyArTxdG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":702}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
