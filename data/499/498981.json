It has also been used in Utopia, Malani's first multiple-screen installation, wherein this film is projected adjacent to the film Utopia, shot after the artist moved to a basic apartment building in a suburb of Bombay. This format allowed her to juxtapose the idealism of the sixties with the later dystopia of urbanism in the seventies.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hraZfWIAQlx9owJsMWfYFa0EGl7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream Houses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1961088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nalini Malani","original_name":"Nalini Malani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5de3c7c3a3686a7c0090d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hraZfWIAQlx9owJsMWfYFa0EGl7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
