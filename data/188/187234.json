Under the name of his jail buddy Henry, he moves in with his pen pal - who has never seen him - and is always watched suspiciously by their roommate. Nik began writing in prison and now seeks contact with the literary culture, even though he feels disgusted by the pompous fuss of this society. He is not without talent and works on a novel in which he minutely describes the abduction of an industrialist. Henry gets shot at the prison breakout and visits Nik to get help from him. He likes his novel plot and wants to put it into action.","popularity":0.3714,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":7011,"logo_path":null,"name":"Planet Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":403,"logo_path":"/h2nyRbglJy4d6TN6UDycqpdsLpr.png","name":"Neue Bioskop Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slow Attack","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Zacher","original_name":"Rolf Zacher","popularity":0.1966,"profile_path":"/l27WA0N4p3LIhJbR13tvUCwCwL7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Henry Kirscher","credit_id":"52fe4d139251416c7512f155","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burkhard Driest","original_name":"Burkhard Driest","popularity":0.1858,"profile_path":"/k2flWgifoErLajv2mSqAhMblVEG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nick Dellmann","credit_id":"52fe4d139251416c7512f159","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katja Rupé","original_name":"Katja Rupé","popularity":0.1357,"profile_path":"/4UK2dssWxYRd4I6yeZT15FgaKrF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Eva","credit_id":"52fe4d139251416c7512f15d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carla Egerer","original_name":"Carla Egerer","popularity":0.1002,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Leila","credit_id":"52fe4d139251416c7512f161","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Raab","original_name":"Kurt Raab","popularity":0.2078,"profile_path":"/wVtzUW8bi4Xmupsjoms369qjIKG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maria Franz Beekenbrandt","credit_id":"52fe4d139251416c7512f165","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eckehard Ahrens","original_name":"Eckehard Ahrens","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Donald","credit_id":"52fe4d139251416c7512f169","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Buschmann","original_name":"Joey Buschmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Janni","credit_id":"52fe4d139251416c7512f16d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veit Relin","original_name":"Veit Relin","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Dorsil","credit_id":"52fe4d139251416c7512f171","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marquard Bohm","original_name":"Marquard Bohm","popularity":0.2646,"profile_path":"/iaoq5Hv8eBvWOwl2evapI8zahjO.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"John","credit_id":"52fe4d139251416c7512f175","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hark Bohm","original_name":"Hark Bohm","popularity":0.354,"profile_path":"/qbK0MB6h73iuqXJ4e8ttaKdHB1C.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"TV-Moderator","credit_id":"52fe4d139251416c7512f179","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irm Hermann","original_name":"Irm Hermann","popularity":0.1783,"profile_path":"/4NzeDGGAqq0Aw8QpqTuOAu7DkeN.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Apothekerin","credit_id":"56ce38c6c3a3681e360000bd","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horst Hesslein","original_name":"Horst Hesslein","popularity":0.1139,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"2.
