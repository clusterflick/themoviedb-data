The unusual nature of their liaison is signalled by the fact that Dietmar is bisexual and is completely unable to remain faithful to Luzi. Dietmar also has his own, personal dialect of German. Luzi, on the other hand, is coziness personified. No matter, in this film they get married at the Memorial Church in Berlin. Infuriated at his playing around, Luzi briefly splits up with him, but when her dog dies of poisoning, he is there to comfort her.","popularity":0.2053,"poster_path":"/oz8EdKVAZdWm6j6PVl0nbscobGm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1439,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rosa von Praunheim
