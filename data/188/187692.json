Despite being without his regular cohorts Ku Lung and Ti Lung here, Chu shows his master stroke as he delves into the dastardly ways of evil warlords in China back in the 1910’s. Drama and action both take centre-stage as Tsung Hua and Ching Li fall prey to a lecherous general (Stanley Feng Tsui-fan) who rapes and forces the latter to become his concubine. With the help of two street performers (the deft and agile Chen Kuan-tai and Shih Szu) he once helped, Tsung hatches a plot to save his beloved – with deadly consequences.","popularity":0.5104,"poster_path":"/uMTWx2W7VNejgtbrtRIFXQl0ftW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5798,"logo_path":"/tmuI9BGXgpWLmokhlxpnG3IGNQB.png","name":"Shaw Brothers","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1975-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lover's Destiny","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Fung Shui-Fan","original_name":"馮淬帆","popularity":0.8428,"profile_path":"/oURJiuRSTcykch6KGHCxd2qNOkS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Generalissimo Zhang","credit_id":"56e0840bc3a3682495000007","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsung Hua","original_name":"Tsung Hua","popularity":0.2311,"profile_path":"/6sODRJWVn8UV9uxIPrhP9shELNG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Fan Jia-Shu","credit_id":"56e083d0c3a3687480004fba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ching Li","original_name":"Ching Li","popularity":0.3684,"profile_path":"/iswKNCFOVh9EtUOhWOhMBwQ5vem.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Chen Feng-Shian","credit_id":"56e083dac3a3687492004f30","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chen Kuan-Tai","original_name":"陳觀泰","popularity":0.7412,"profile_path":"/3YdfSpsrj7pjtmN1GwSS8WNL3QT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Guan Shao-Feng","credit_id":"56e083e5c3a3687480004fc0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shih Szu","original_name":"Shih Szu","popularity":0.5155,"profile_path":"/pWLfISn69LCzG33tFic6yR93dbL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Guan Xiu-Zhu","credit_id":"56e083f39251413988000001","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1178497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Ching","original_name":"Li Ching","popularity":0.2546,"profile_path":"/3noA853TiFHpdFclFDWDTQNX8iq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"He Li-Shia","credit_id":"56e083ffc3a3682495000003","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wang Hsieh","original_name":"Wang Hsieh","popularity":0.3524,"profile_path":"/4DZpNUWJ2wqQczhevahwmkMa216.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Div.
