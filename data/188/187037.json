His employer is Sergio, a former stuntman and self-styled invalid who is busy with a thousand imaginative jobs just to make some money and who shares a house with his sister Maria, a hotline operator. As the competition in front of the Colosseum becomes increasingly tough, Milan devises a plan to defeat everyone and, using his university studies, builds a real chariot with which to attract as many customers as possible.","popularity":0.3236,"poster_path":"/oFajvWGA0YocyYahvDSfRIC4jUP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Combo
