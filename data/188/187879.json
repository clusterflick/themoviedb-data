He settled in the West Village, where he mixed with artists who later became the Abstract Expressionists, encouraged New York’s emerging filmmakers such as Francis Lee, taught with Hans Richter, and assisted Ian Hugo on Bells of Atlantis. Color Cry was based on a development of the “rayogram” or “shadow cast” process, using fabrics as stencils, with the images synchronized to a haunting blues song by Sonny Terry, which Lye imagined to be the anguished cry of a runaway slave. —Harvard Film Archive","popularity":0.2202,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Color Cry","video":false,"vote_average":5.611,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"カラー・クライ","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","title":"Barvni krik","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonny Terry","original_name":"Sonny Terry","popularity":0.1095,"profile_path":"/92tdFBiOkTwsCCLyOj7Qx3NTRtZ.jpg","credit_id":"6255f38966ae4d12ddc15ad1","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonny Terry","original_name":"Sonny Terry","popularity":0.1095,"profile_path":"/92tdFBiOkTwsCCLyOj7Qx3NTRtZ.jpg","credit_id":"6255f3808d2f8d009db927f4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Len Lye","original_name":"Len Lye","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/rGNL1Bzvje4x7wWxtapS3en2NVO.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d289251416c75131ec5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0044507","wikidata_id":"Q69624334","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":213891,"name":"abstract"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285318,"name":"paint on film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"The San Francisco Museum of Art","release_date":"1952-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
