He leaves the floor of the pampas and climbs into the mountains looking for prey. In a nest he discovers a flying burro. He captures it and, after several close calls, tames the creature, and he takes it back to town where he enters the burro, with himself on its back, in a horse race. If they win, it means a prize of 1,000 pesos. Can the burro get its act together long enough to fly in a straight line and win? It's the stuff of legends.","popularity":0.1139,"poster_path":"/x5k6o1gG5pkOCh7fQeZ5NT0QPyK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flying Gauchito","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":566738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Shields","original_name":"Fred Shields","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/qPPgNgjClaEDvRoxtFMan2vuUu9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"663cfa707601152fab0e9976","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22066,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Eric Larson","original_name":"Eric Larson","popularity":0.2355,"profile_path":"/gNrUDEgF3qgspHxLNGR01byJZGx.jpg","credit_id":"565a0428c3a3680ac1000a43","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63646,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Frank Thomas","original_name":"Frank Thomas","popularity":0.1342,"profile_path":"/ex3jyUogtwMt2zQgzmh3cwEz8ds.jpg","credit_id":"565a1ad092514161c1000d5b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11427,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bill Roberts","original_name":"Bill Roberts","popularity":0.1744,"profile_path":"/fB85xGVxw4wMt86THRzeWTOOYst.jpg","credit_id":"66e8b55bb2917eb1800a873d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0037710","wikidata_id":"Q3203547","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x5k6o1gG5pkOCh7fQeZ5NT0QPyK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.644,"height":868,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zLptr3XhjxizxWwjicfTXEKeobY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":559},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4qYdCbTI8u1jZ4wtGL7Q0Wnva8V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1945-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
