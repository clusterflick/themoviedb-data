After Tina falls asleep, she dreams about a camping trip with Barney and the rest of the Backyard Gang. Barney takes the gang through different fun experiences from pitching tents to having a snack. In the mist of things, a storm comes around and Tina gets lost in the woods. Thanks to Barney's advice earlier of \"Stay where you are, hug a tree and blow your whistle,\" everyone finds Tina and they continue onto more campfire fun. They even explore a cave where a bear lives. Back at the campfire, songs are sung around it and everyone learns how to make S'mores. After the trip is over, Tina wakes up and realizes it was all just a dream - and a magical one at that.","popularity":0.4838,"poster_path":"/4PlydlaN6Uq8fnBdXch6mrvClC1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barney's Campfire Sing-Along","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Eppes","original_name":"Brian Eppes","popularity":0.1238,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"5c667b4e0e0a26562799d726","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leah Gloria","original_name":"Leah Gloria","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Luci","credit_id":"5c667b5f0e0a26562799d731","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rickey Carter","original_name":"Rickey Carter","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Derek","credit_id":"5c667b810e0a267de69dccbc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob West","original_name":"Bob West","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Barney (voice)","credit_id":"67e97d5e2cca6fc8fbc6c5d9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1938839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Zucha","original_name":"Jessica Zucha","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Tina","credit_id":"67e97d6eaf752a3b24f6f06e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Becky Swonke","original_name":"Becky Swonke","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Amy","credit_id":"67e97d8fa98dc813b0f6e581","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Albert","original_name":"Chris Albert","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jimmy","credit_id":"67e97dd77a75294b76c6ac93","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":120608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Manzano","original_name":"Sonia Manzano","popularity":0.2542,"profile_path":"/A6TS7GLwbC4tVfr686IaNH2DTXe.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Tina's mom","credit_id":"67e97de83fca90d2dff6e6ee","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Moore","original_name":"Richard Moore","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"The Bear (voice)","credit_id":"67e97e042cca6fc8fbc6c626","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470157,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kathy Parker","original_name":"Kathy Parker","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c667bd0925141250a019b49","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dwin Towell","original_name":"Dwin Towell","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c667b9a0e0a262fa199f154","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1825671","wikidata_id":"Q48314250","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4PlydlaN6Uq8fnBdXch6mrvClC1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1990-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
