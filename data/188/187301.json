Shot over six months, this eclectic Indonesian montage delivers a very different take on the archipelago that has kept surfers enchanted for over four decades. Set to a rhapsodic soundtrack and also featuring the best high performance action from Bali, If it’s Loud it’s Cool will lock you in like a long Indo barrel.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If It's Loud It's Cool","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"MA15+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
