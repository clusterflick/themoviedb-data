They marry because that's what you are supposed to do. But something goes wrong on their wedding night. They have no idea what to do with each other. Sexually. Emotionally. The husband meets a man who knows what to do with his sexuality. Suddenly a hand can do something no hand has done before and lips something no lips have ever done. The two men have a secret love affair. But there is a problem: The woman. And she has something up her sleeve. Will she act? Yes, she will. What happens? Nobody knows. Until now.","popularity":0.3514,"poster_path":"/9oAKbLQf5s5OxEvdWmN6pS5wTDO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76,"logo_path":"/nebkQYtQKhZyHJfh5v0oGpNbPzu.png","name":"Zentropa Entertainments","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":118,"logo_path":"/AiBorgNTCS1lT1FdFPYheax9jfF.png","name":"Det Danske Filminstitut","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":2801,"logo_path":"/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png","name":"Film i Väst","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2003-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Now","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mads Mikkelsen","original_name":"Mads Mikkelsen","popularity":6.9558,"profile_path":"/ntwPvV4GKGGHO3I7LcHMwhXfsw9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jakob (young)","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c751324ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erland Josephson","original_name":"Erland Josephson","popularity":0.2757,"profile_path":"/dopG1nAzyT23DMAPyPoUuwbZs4a.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jakob (old)","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c751324f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikael Persbrandt","original_name":"Mikael Persbrandt","popularity":1.0556,"profile_path":"/ppJ6sjgdqzLt5gN5YqqBD1IVxbu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Adam (young)","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c751324f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henning Moritzen","original_name":"Henning Moritzen","popularity":0.1499,"profile_path":"/tAax9obEx0Zdg9SjXeLCzKFqCBz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Adam (old)","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c751324f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1035898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elin Klinga","original_name":"Elin Klinga","popularity":0.1254,"profile_path":"/hQ0MyAqIMvbjdJECDi0QmvGGaPq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c751324fd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Staho","original_name":"Simon Staho","popularity":0.1064,"profile_path":"/jUWIOVyieHQov7lGdDLAU8EiRVA.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c75132503","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Staho","original_name":"Simon Staho","popularity":0.1064,"profile_path":"/jUWIOVyieHQov7lGdDLAU8EiRVA.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c75132509","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1631,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Asmussen","original_name":"Peter Asmussen","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c7513250f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541909,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"István Borbás","original_name":"István Borbás","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c5acc1dbcade017b6fc8e4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0344128","wikidata_id":"Q33555240","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ppWzOj96H1lksKz5mX2Qc3S18i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/by6UUYlo6CI8r2BWiM9txH15PR9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/sSuOIQc7N4OfotAQMoJlHXNfMDI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9oAKbLQf5s5OxEvdWmN6pS5wTDO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"},{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"7","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
