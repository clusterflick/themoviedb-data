They agree with one stipulation: If they write the movie, he has to make it.  It's a comedy, a love story, a psycho-sexual thriller, and a supernatural adventure all in one. Meanwhile, documentary footage of the writing process provides an inside look into the often-hilarious creative process, as well as the group dynamics that make collaboration between friends difficult.","popularity":0.2854,"poster_path":"/jMTJoMWujmGKUhEnjLSL2fCIhPw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A new comedy/drama/documentary/thriller/action movie/buddy picture/heist flick","title":"The Exquisite Corpse Project","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caleb Bark","original_name":"Caleb Bark","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Marc","credit_id":"52fe4d1e9251416c75130919","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megan Raye Manzi","original_name":"Megan Raye Manzi","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Adayit / Meg","credit_id":"52fe4d1e9251416c7513091d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1169459,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Julia Rivas Frey","original_name":"Julia Rivas Frey","popularity":0.1167,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Stephanie","credit_id":"52fe4d1e9251416c75130921","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoff Lee","original_name":"Geoff Lee","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/q5kPC3aSUntLbuRCHf8Jpzt1imq.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mr. Kim","credit_id":"52fe4d1e9251416c75130929","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Sollis","original_name":"Jonathan Sollis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Cop #2","credit_id":"6500ebb9db4ed61033a240de","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1605881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trevor Williams","original_name":"Trevor Williams","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Yustus","credit_id":"6689494304a3686fffd31d42","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Popik","original_name":"Ben Popik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d1e9251416c751308f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169456,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Raphael Bob-Waksberg","original_name":"Raphael Bob-Waksberg","popularity":0.3539,"profile_path":"/2ktN8lJhecCKG77nlDm3dISbnxk.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d1e9251416c75130915","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Conover","original_name":"Adam Conover","popularity":0.2002,"profile_path":"/tbVGWnkNPAgr8dthkRnIA6p7dBG.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d1e9251416c75130909","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169455,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dave Segal","original_name":"Dave Segal","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/n3zICZQJFWaFNqeKD7p4BAfTKVw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d1e9251416c7513090f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169452,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chioke Nassor","original_name":"Chioke Nassor","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d1e9251416c751308fd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169453,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joel Clark","original_name":"Joel Clark","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d1e9251416c75130903","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2093256","wikidata_id":"Q7732874","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":2214,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jMTJoMWujmGKUhEnjLSL2fCIhPw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1497}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Exquisite Corpse Project (2013) - Official Trailer","key":"LJBUQKvGZ0o","published_at":"2012-05-19T19:50:36.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec70ac3a368544800a716"}]}}}
