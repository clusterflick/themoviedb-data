Extensive archival material – much of which has never been seen before – together with extracts from performances and rehearsals, as well as interviews and coverage of various tours and travels, reveal an in-depth portrait of the Théâtre du Soleil, and its artistic and political commitment both in France and internationally, for which it was awarded the International Ibsen Award in September 2009.  Everyone who has seen one of Ariane Mnouchkine’s productions at the Théatre du Soleil in Paris leaves with the feeling of having been part of a tale of enchantment. A tale that is larger than life but at the same time reveals life.","popularity":0.0784,"poster_path":"/6PQUPoXWNkcX3DsyuLrW9CZl3QJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films & Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ariane Mnouchkine - L'aventure du Théâtre du Soleil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Ariane Mnouchkine mit Leib und Seele","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariane Mnouchkine","original_name":"Ariane Mnouchkine","popularity":0.1449,"profile_path":"/eyxBImqpcEzi9NsjmDyalRnLh5i.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e9cad81dff66e001e09b2b3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1496137,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Vilpoux","original_name":"Catherine Vilpoux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b71d733a3760175d3d7d3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2273596,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cathie Dambel","original_name":"Cathie Dambel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b71e254a09800e4102adc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1496137,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Vilpoux","original_name":"Catherine Vilpoux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b71dda5046e00e5b75942","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1290186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marie Balducchi","original_name":"Marie Balducchi","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b71c954a09801728ac00f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296889,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Emmanuelle Collinot","original_name":"Emmanuelle Collinot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b71d133a3760158dae1b0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1496137,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Vilpoux","original_name":"Catherine Vilpoux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9cad78dff66e001e09b2a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2285385","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6PQUPoXWNkcX3DsyuLrW9CZl3QJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
