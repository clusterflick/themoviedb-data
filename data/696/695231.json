From the sourcing and transformation of bamboo in Chiang Mai, to its installation in Singapore, the documentary gives rare insights into the making of the artwork. By tracing Rirkrit's thoughts and portraying his cultural and spiritual environment, it offers broader understanding of his artistic practice. Structured around three meals, from day to night, the film meditates on the differences and similarities between two cities where the work was developed.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/zo9WrNPHpdReer6bi55De1L9Isd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where the Light Shines Through","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2438291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nelson Yeo","original_name":"Nelson Yeo","popularity":0.0792,"profile_path":"/eou9R424iU0u2kNMGf6VfOb0KSX.jpg","credit_id":"5e9d5962dff66e00230a6f4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2438291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nelson Yeo","original_name":"Nelson Yeo","popularity":0.0792,"profile_path":"/eou9R424iU0u2kNMGf6VfOb0KSX.jpg","credit_id":"5e9d5981e22d28001b625290","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2438291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nelson Yeo","original_name":"Nelson Yeo","popularity":0.0792,"profile_path":"/eou9R424iU0u2kNMGf6VfOb0KSX.jpg","credit_id":"5e9d598ef6fd180022e65f51","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zo9WrNPHpdReer6bi55De1L9Isd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"National Gallery Singapore","release_date":"2018-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer | Where the Light Shines Through: A Film by Nelson Yeo","key":"xndrXaePKqg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-08-23T07:17:36.000Z","id":"5e9f14dc1f331900244c7e78"}]}}}
