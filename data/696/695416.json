An international team, made up of some of the best climbers in the world, attempts this ascent. After a long journey in their canoes along the jungle river, their project takes them to live on the wall for a fortnight, in very bad and dangerous conditions. Heavy floods, constant humidity, food rationing, technical difficulties as well as the hardest mental and physical effort seem to place the ascent beyond their possibilities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amazonian Vertigo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
