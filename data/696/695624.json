The main theme is freedom. At the very beginning of the play, Vera Pavlovna utters a text that becomes the manifesto of her life: “I want to be free, I do not want to be indebted to anyone, I do not want anyone to tell me: you must do this for me! I want to do only what I want. And let others do the same; I don’t want to demand anything from anyone, I don’t want to restrict freedom and I want to be free myself. ”","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/ztqQuttdblitbRHMaMJt3mcNSyi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BDT Digital: What To Do?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2609726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Aleksandrova","original_name":"Nina Aleksandrova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Vera Pavlovna","credit_id":"5e9ecdedeec5b5002141831a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2610102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Pavlovich","original_name":"Boris Pavlovich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Author","credit_id":"5e9f1cbce635710024f925e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2610103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Varvara Pavlova","original_name":"Varvara Pavlova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Beauty","credit_id":"5e9f1ce70ed2ab0026e71665","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2217013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitry Lugovkin","original_name":"Dmitry Lugovkin","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/vxdnoYuCbRnuVNzbtTzT6EXUPJE.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dmitry Sergeevich Lopukhov","credit_id":"5e9f1d09eec5b5001a41d1c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2610105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Egor Medvedev","original_name":"Egor Medvedev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Alexander Matveevich Kirsanov","credit_id":"5e9f1d2dc92c5d001cb7e7d1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2110942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irute Vengalite","original_name":"Irute Vengalite","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/r9VCUUPtbNMvvod4Fvt7u3AT7hr.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Marya Alekseevna Rozalskaya, Vera's mother","credit_id":"5e9f1d48d05a030020be894c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1190204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgiy Shtil","original_name":"Георгий Штиль","popularity":0.3633,"profile_path":"/gT7o9B4YN36yJlQCTCuRszFCVwl.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Pavel Konstantinovich Rozalsky, Vera's father","credit_id":"5e9f1d640ed2ab0020e70c1a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395047,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nikolay Chernyshevsky","original_name":"Nikolay Chernyshevsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/erfjUcVJCtkcvHj8TNZXdEvuPHw.jpg","credit_id":"5e9ecdb30ed2ab0020e6c6cc","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2609723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrey Moguchiy","original_name":"Andrey Moguchiy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9ecd6ec92c5d001ab79931","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/ztqQuttdblitbRHMaMJt3mcNSyi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
