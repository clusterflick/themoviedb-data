Using still images, animation, Super-8 and an experimental score composed and performed by the filmmaker, The Drive North subverts the typical coming-of-age tale with social commentary, humor and an understated identity-politics slant. This savvy short demonstrates the skills of the next generation of media makers, seamlessly incorporating an astute sense of self-reflection, rebellion and family relationships.","popularity":0.0883,"poster_path":"/zQ3nkZyWLEQnRyUqEzndZyaO0J5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Drive North","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1538980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rhys Ernst","original_name":"Rhys Ernst","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":"/ijvv58Zhqnr20zDEcAul6ALLFtI.jpg","credit_id":"5e9cffd8680be80020c5948c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2226585","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zQ3nkZyWLEQnRyUqEzndZyaO0J5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
