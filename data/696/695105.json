Much Ojibwa history and philosophy has been related through the rock carvings and paintings which are featured throughout this work. The voices of the Elders are heard in the film, describing the tales of creation and existence that mark the group's iconography. A sense of mystery informs this evocative film as the realization strikes that no individual can expect to penetrate the mythos of the Ojibwa.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rKjNJrPhPbzXGf5bpX5PoUsRbhg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Teaching Rocks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2607822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lloyd Walton","original_name":"Lloyd Walton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9cd0a9680be80026c561a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1776,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rKjNJrPhPbzXGf5bpX5PoUsRbhg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1184}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
