Filmed in 2002, Dancing to Architecture is essential for anyone who wants to gain an impression of what the TINA festival is like. It is rapid, chaotic, anarchic and urgent. It is dramatic, electric, technical, and socially relevant. It is Australiaâ€™s biggest event for communications, new media arts, music and activism.  If you are expecting this film to tell you what This Is Not Art is, then we suggest you stop and go look at their website instead:","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1kPn8b9Ovgf7iTBSK70Yii9732m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dancing to Architecture - A Motion Picture About TINA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Hr8QF8HbrKceMBEza9l8Bj30yR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1kPn8b9Ovgf7iTBSK70Yii9732m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
