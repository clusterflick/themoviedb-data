Shot by drone and 4K camera over 1400 m above sea level, the frames function as a visual journey through the peaks of the Mt and green wooded areas, but the video presents a journey from a twisted perspective. Scenes of spectacular natural scenery, partially colored to evoke the surreal surface of planet Earth and open the door to a World “on the other side of the view”. With this video collage, Zelenika creates a kind of ultimate meditative haven, with ideal conditions for the process of immersing oneself in times of broken privacy, pervasive panopticon and inflation of information.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/rBcBjTuSeG0vlZe8PSjSk4bkH71.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91093,"logo_path":null,"name":"104 Films","origin_country":""},{"id":150942,"logo_path":null,"name":"biggerhouse film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Introversion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2610567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"MOON Martina Zelenika","original_name":"MOON Martina Zelenika","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9f8201162bc3001e02818c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2610572,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marjan Radović","original_name":"Marjan Radović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9f8283db72c00024eea1db","department":"Camera","job":"Drone Pilot"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1075,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rBcBjTuSeG0vlZe8PSjSk4bkH71.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":717}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
