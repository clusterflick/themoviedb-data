This area of the country is sparsely populated and rural, and is mostly defined by agriculture and a rather frugal architecture reminiscent of that of the Hanseatic cities. It's here that an extensive military site was built in the 1930s. It is used as a training area for the German army and also includes a garrison town, in which parts of the military corps reside. The site covers a surface area of 323 square kilometres. It is the third-biggest military area in Germany and the most modern in Europe.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Altmark","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1482665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Wilke","original_name":"Marie Wilke","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666888f6282af652f2d034d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
