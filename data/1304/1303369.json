This eye-opening documentary also reveals the camp’s medieval medical practices—from bleeding to burning—and discovers a butcher who moonlights as the camp surgeon. Sudan’s Secret Side shows how the refugees have created their own village life inside a camp outside of their home country.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Secret Lives of Sudan’s Refugees","title":"Sudan’s Secret Side","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3758278","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
