The sold-out match marked the 76th anniversary of the Nakba and highlighted the ongoing genocide and human rights violations happening every day in occupied Palestine. It was one of the most emotional and important games ever held at Dalymount Park in its long and storied history since 1901, and the event raised over €100,000 for three Palestinian humanitarian organizations.","popularity":0.5842,"poster_path":"/gvLgELcmEt0OtyTnVfMOE983CzL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201546,"logo_path":null,"name":"PushPull Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Saoirse don Phalaistín!","title":"Let It Bring Hope: Bohemians v Palestine","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4768755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mira Natour","original_name":"Mira Natour","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6667d6afdf4e93a9fa6c8960","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4768756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bisan Abuaita","original_name":"Bisan Abuaita","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6667d6dbec6be38defd02f5a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4768762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pia Kassis","original_name":"Pia Kassis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6667d831419b28ec1a1c5185","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4768751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deema Said","original_name":"Deema Said","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6667d5a7224e13490fa6b85f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liam Cunningham","original_name":"Liam Cunningham","popularity":1.0212,"profile_path":"/ljmFT9zYqh4k2bmEcNU6rxoE7fW.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6667d653752063ec0eea03c6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4256419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Róisín El Cherif","original_name":"Róisín El Cherif","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6667dac3e4dcea7e1f1f9636","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4768765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niamh Learmont","original_name":"Niamh Learmont","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6667d938d98414c89d85c57b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4768769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Radie Peat","original_name":"Radie Peat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6667db0c1eceaab87f85bbdf","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2008937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael D.
