Nguyễn identifies “peripheries”—including natural landscapes used as backdrops, uncredited characters and soundtracks from American and Vietnamese movies—that reveal more-than-human perspectives. Offering new ways of looking and listening, 47 Days, Sound-less invites audiences to reflect on the inextricable relationship between a place and its inhabitants.","popularity":0.2537,"poster_path":"/pmu2heoTQ90cciOQGIDS4NUsbiM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Han Nefkens Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":231158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mori Art Museum","origin_country":""},{"id":61360,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hong Kong Arts Centre","origin_country":""},{"id":144618,"logo_path":null,"name":"Singapore Art Museum","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Experimental, Vietnamese, Short","title":"47 Days, Sound-less","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nguyễn Trinh Thi","original_name":"Nguyễn Trinh Thi","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/lVX9qOa3uaw4DFoOIDD5ztwiEZa.jpg","credit_id":"6667ac14964e2976a2a6b12a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pmu2heoTQ90cciOQGIDS4NUsbiM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":155554,"name":"semi-documentary"},{"id":167234,"name":"vietnamese"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
