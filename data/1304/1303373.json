In the arena of power, she might assume a role that she is already very familiar with. In the early years following the fall of the Berlin Wall, Sahra Wagenknecht became the \"most famous face\" of the PDS, the successor party to the SED. Yet, even as the youngest member of the party's executive board, she was considered a \"disruptive factor.\" She is unyielding and swims against the tide. Sahra Wagenknecht does not distance herself from Stalinism, nor from the Berlin Wall, and wishes for a reformed GDR.","popularity":0.436,"poster_path":"/6ae6FHjizGz4sBzNtsSgrnvSZ10.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":32536,"logo_path":"/wpvXQ3OrEblZWofZ5aqURpOWgU8.png","name":"LOOKSfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trotz
