The wealthy and self-absorbed Per Persson is in love with the miller’s beautiful daughter, Grethe, whose heart, however, belongs to the miller’s apprentice. To Persson’s great frustration, Grethe would never dream of choosing wealth over love, so Persson instead – and unsuccessfully – tries to get rid of his rival in all sorts of nefarious ways. As a result of various complications, Pat and Patachon are employed as helping hands at the old mill and become good friends with the miller’s widow, Grethe and the apprentice. The miller’s widow is in financial trouble, and Patachon’s eagerness to help soon gets him and Pat embroiled in an arson case.
