A love that ultimately leads to the migration and distance of lovers, causing their separation. Four monitors are embedded around the audience, displaying images of Persian miniatures and inserts as well as images of an Iranian woman. In the space between the monitors are candles, wine glasses, a place for Persian poetry, and a stage where four female Iranian pop singers before the Islamic Revolution sing songs about love and separation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cjVaCxqGlLWNCnA8wO78wOHW6Q6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The one you wanted to get lost in the dust!","title":"On the Edge of the Galaxy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"AmirHossein Shirali","original_name":"AmirHossein Shirali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66696082bd5a7a1d06a72217","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cjVaCxqGlLWNCnA8wO78wOHW6Q6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
