Held at the Festa do Culto ao Mito do Divino Espírito Santo in Pirenópolis, state of Goiás, in 1968, it was completed in 1969, in Rio de Janeiro. The film is extremely important for the memory of Brazilian popular culture and the state of Goiás, as it is a work of art about this popular festival, and not just a documentary record, as it reflects its cultural character. Today the party is considered Cultural Heritage of Brazil by IPHAN.","popularity":0.0641,"poster_path":"/7bCEzNKxaB58N2f6KeBcznE17Bd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107923,"logo_path":null,"name":"Instituto Nacional de Cinema","origin_country":""},{"id":24739,"logo_path":"/oW8mMl0C5EuIzbFFB2ot1rAGDgB.png","name":"Universidade de Brasília","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pirenópolis – O Divino e as Máscaras","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulo Gil Soares","original_name":"Paulo Gil Soares","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/2UwMsrprScGFNO7qcou3lJbsuOV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66685992775e1ca8133c6826","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3059717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lyonel Lucini","original_name":"Lionel Lucini","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666859ab0930c34694c2ac89","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498673,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Leonardo Bartucci","original_name":"Leonardo Bartucci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666859f93664149dad8af986","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4769253,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olimpio Trindade Serra","original_name":"Olimpio Trindade Serra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666859d232018f91663c685a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1054091,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Graça","original_name":"Alberto Graça","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666859ef0de759906266f8e7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3059717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lyonel Lucini","original_name":"Lionel Lucini","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666859a006cffca70f8af965","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4769251,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Afonso Henriques Guimarães","original_name":"Afonso Henriques Guimarães","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666859bf775dcbb55c8af978","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1062870,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hermano Penna","original_name":"Hermano Penna","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":"/tr0OmBdhkoGMfLPBmoIVBS1lQvx.jpg","credit_id":"666859dd7cbed2fef3bea220","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7bCEzNKxaB58N2f6KeBcznE17Bd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
