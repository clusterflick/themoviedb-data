He works at a reputable firm called FusionMag and is finding it challenging to focus on work or anything else as the death of his wife was so sudden and mysterious. The pressure from having to show up every day, causes him to use toxic ways to cope with his pain. While working, he meets a younger lady named Lisa, who he is supposed to mentor and help her with her writing as she is fighting for a spot in FusionMag as she proves to her mom that she can make a living from writing. Through the time of the mentorship, the two of them, (even though very opposite in personalities), build a very special friendship that helps each other face their conflicts and overcome them . This film will tackle unhealthy ways of dealing with depression, highlight the struggles of first-generation creatives, provide comic relief and also keep audience members on the edge of their seats with drama.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":231224,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeal Films Matrix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lisa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4770198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliet Amoah","original_name":"Juliet Amoah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"6668eb51775e1ca8133c775c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4770200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cesar Cage","original_name":"Cesar Cage","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kwasi (as Dylan Tchedji)","credit_id":"6668eb5d864f4400a11a18bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4770201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Elster","original_name":"Judith Elster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Carmen","credit_id":"6668eb67a1c297c0699c387f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4770202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kingsley Osei-Abrah","original_name":"Kingsley Osei-Abrah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6668eb7da7f75fd5a81c527c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4770202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kingsley Osei-Abrah","original_name":"Kingsley Osei-Abrah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6668eb87ede07937ad1a17a5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4770202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kingsley Osei-Abrah","original_name":"Kingsley Osei-Abrah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6668eb8fe3437cc5e5beab9e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4770202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kingsley Osei-Abrah","original_name":"Kingsley Osei-Abrah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6668eb95c8fe1f88cd8b0aa5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4770202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kingsley Osei-Abrah","original_name":"Kingsley Osei-Abrah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6668eb72e3437cc5e5beab86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4770204,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fiderlixe Yankey","original_name":"Fiderlixe Yankey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6668eba70a4e0068a1d04526","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4770203,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Emmanuel Adum","original_name":"Emmanuel Adum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6668eb9eac5b7726059c3a2c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
