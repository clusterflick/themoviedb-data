Vita spends all her time taking care of her mother at home, while Arthur squanders his money at the city’s most notorious nightclubs. Vita is engaged to the diligent and striving Jacob, who has to step in when Arthur’s debauched life leads him into great debt. A particularly drunken pub crawl ends tragically when Arthur falls into the harbour and drowns. Vita and her mother grieve deeply, and Jacob, who has sacrificed all his savings to cover his brother-in-law’s debt, must travel to Australia to rebuild a fortune for his and Vita’s future. Here, by a stroke of fortune, he comes into contact with a man who will prove to be of great importance to himself, Vita and her mother.
