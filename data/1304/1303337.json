The film explores their history from their student days at St Martin’s in the late sixties to their early success as living sculptures, their postal art and drinking works to their large scale pictures, following the unique creative process of their Fundamental Pictures depicting their own bodily fluids. We see their daily life at home in Fournier Street, around the East End where they perform unique performances for camera with specially painted faces and a relationship between two special artists who know how to combine their charm with extraordinary performance. The producer Gerald Fox presents a portrait of two individuals who revolutionized the art scene in a very special way.","popularity":0.0711,"poster_path":"/clRNrG1jqi9Xj8BsS4blzjN9cWx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fundamental Gilbert and George","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1960831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilbert Proesch","original_name":"Gilbert Proesch","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66688221df146b7b45a6b688","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1651315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Passmore","original_name":"George Passmore","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66688232663197f8b8be9f27","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1128534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerald Fox","original_name":"Gerald Fox","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/1ugSOSHQzVYmEnkryjWooaMYHTQ.jpg","credit_id":"666881cfe71034010fbe962e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/clRNrG1jqi9Xj8BsS4blzjN9cWx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":669}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1997-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
