As she delves into the depths of her solitude, she becomes disoriented, losing herself in the vast expanse of her isolation. The pain permeates not only her physical form but also resonates within the very core of her being, plunging her into an abyss of profound despair.  Her deep-seated resentment towards her mother becomes the catalyst for the unfortunate demise of her most cherished relationship. The sheer magnitude of her emotional turmoil, fueled by this unresolved animosity, acts as a disruptive force, driving a wedge between her and the person who held the key to her heart. Regrettably, the repercussions of this festering anger result in the loss of the one true love she held dear, forever altering the trajectory of her life.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Dance","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
