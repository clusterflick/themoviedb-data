An exploration of a hallucinatory space constructed from visual and aural debris. The figure of the endlessly flowing image is simultaneously a visual leitmotif that speaks to the passage of time as well as a reflection on the nature of images as deformed mirrors of reality. The soundtrack, created by the composer Méryll Ampe, responds to the piece by producing dream spaces out of electronic and acoustic materials on the limit of erasure.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/sDLXg9BaHjTOifCn0fMcI9lJZGY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"YAGÉ","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3216700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Molina Gola","original_name":"Martín Molina Gola","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6667faec902b6e13716c8ab2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sDLXg9BaHjTOifCn0fMcI9lJZGY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
