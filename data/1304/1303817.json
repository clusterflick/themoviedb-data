A large revolver is on the opposite side of the table. The man is evidently an habitual drunkard and is lamenting his fate. He pours out a glass of whiskey, and with a despairing look, starts to drink it. He changes his mind upon seeing the revolver and seizing it places it against his temple, but right here he changes his mind again, and laying the revolver carefully upon the table, drinks the whiskey with a contented smile. He bursts into a fit of laughter and points his finger at the audience.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1902-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Burlesque Suicide","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Burlesque Suicide, No. 1","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin S.
