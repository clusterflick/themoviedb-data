In 1979, Jamie Hill, a spoiled multimillionaire, was kidnapped by the ERP guerrillas and released for a ransom of 4 million dollars. After his release, Hill suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, had marital problems and began drinking and using drugs. This went on for a couple of years until he realized he had to stop. Since 1986, Hill has been drug-free. The kidnappers' lives have also changed radically since the kidnapping. Joaquín Villalobos, the infamous guerrilla leader who funded his army with kidnappings, and his ex-soldiers have become high officials in the new democratic El Salvador and signed, among other things, the peace agreement with the United Nations in 1992. Today, Villalobos and Hill are close friends who work together to build the country.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tala med fienden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SV","title":"Hablando con el enemigo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4772410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nitza Kakossaios","original_name":"Nitza Kakossaios","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666a7d4dac6efed36ea7954e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4772410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nitza Kakossaios","original_name":"Nitza Kakossaios","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666a7d391630bbfe5b966940","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23019044","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
