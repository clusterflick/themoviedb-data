A Kombi travels from Amsterdam to Goa, India. This journey is the raw material for Boom Shankar, the only film directed by Guará Rodrigues, a mythical character in Brazilian cinema, both as an actor and behind the camera, as an assistant to some of the greatest directors of the period. That film disappeared before its release, but some recently found fragments are combined with testimonies from members of the trip that recover the libertarian and pioneering spirit of the time.","popularity":0.1267,"poster_path":"/p4s6y10AiPEE4uPnHOwDkvSGrH5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122465,"logo_path":null,"name":"DGT Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2024-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boom Shankar – O Filme Perdido do Guará","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Boom Shankar","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":571936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guará Rodrigues","original_name":"Guará Rodrigues","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":"/k3EUGQtBGe2vm2ReKQAHKEEsy5v.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6667c1ad147a2f8f82d02b5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4768668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Célia Nogueira","original_name":"Célia Nogueira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6667c1b6fb1c5705e6f76849","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4768670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Nogueira","original_name":"Toni Nogueira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6667c1fcca33ab38ee6c8ad1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4768671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Figueiredo","original_name":"Carlos Figueiredo","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6667c210535b32179785c1f4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4768670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Nogueira","original_name":"Toni Nogueira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6667c24f213aac0ae0d028d7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4768670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Nogueira","original_name":"Toni Nogueira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6667c256a004e0cde3a6afea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2468344,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sergio Gagliardi-Gag","original_name":"Sergio Gagliardi-Gag","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6667c2258716eb5f689a12dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2468344,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sergio Gagliardi-Gag","original_name":"Sergio Gagliardi-Gag","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6667c23ff9d6290a4bddd04a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2468344,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sergio Gagliardi-Gag","original_name":"Sergio Gagliardi-Gag","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6667c245e0aa367f0f1f9337","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4768674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adelaide dos Santos","original_name":"Adelaide dos Santos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6667c26a8b317a6e211f92ce","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4768670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Nogueira","original_name":"Toni Nogueira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6667c25fa0c24ad4976c8898","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o5Y5vX0nR15p17AOTM9ZbqSZPV6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p4s6y10AiPEE4uPnHOwDkvSGrH5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"CineOP – Mostra de Cinema de Ouro Preto","release_date":"2024-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BOOM SHANKAR - TRAILER","key":"MYzsO5dmdhI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-05-10T20:31:45.000Z","id":"6667c18df26b352574a6b75f"}]}}}
