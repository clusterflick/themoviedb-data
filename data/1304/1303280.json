Director Statement This is a personal film about gratification and how the feeling of being unseen by a parents in your childhood can affect ones desires when you become older.  In this film I wanted to blend my personal life with fiction in a surreal and elusive environment - the subconscious, and to explore how behavioral patterns is created.  I am very grateful that this film was made and I have my fantastic film crew and actors to thank. Thank you so much! You have all have a special place in my heart.  In addition, I would like to thank Gothenburg Film Studios and Gothenburg Studios Development for giving us access to studio 3. Without your support it wouldn't been possible to make the film.  Also thanks to Gothenburg Studios Development and Storyline for lending us the technical equipment used in this film. It was an absolute necessity, without it there would be no film.  And finally, I want to thank Nordiska Filmskolan for all the support and help with the production! The guidance by fellow students and our teacher Inuk Jørgensen has been so valuable that it's hard to put into words.  I hope the film makes you think and feel something new, and makes you question your own desires and behavior towards others.
