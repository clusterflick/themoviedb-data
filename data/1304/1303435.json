Nothing is right. Nothing is in its place. Marta, her little sister, is not even able to feel good in her own skin. The banality of the funeral, the coldness of the house, the terrible feeling of not being able to return the favor to the one who gave so much for her. It all piles up on her mind and crowds behind her eyes, but Marta refuses to cry. To do so would be to betray Lucia's memory. She prefers to work and let herself go in an eternal repetition. And yet Daniela has other plans for her. After all, her loss does not belong to her alone.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":"/iM8VAaRAsFbkCAyBzmaDzJcJplp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":231251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Escarlata
