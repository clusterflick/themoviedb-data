Shun (Cheung Ying-choi) and Sum (Nam Hung) are happily married with a son. Shun's childless uncle from the US proposes to take away their son as his own and, when the couple refuse, demands that Shun marry a second wife to bear him an offspring. The couple in distress team up with their naughty friends in playing a game of bluff, which sets off a series of whimsical and side-splitting sequences. Director Chor Yuen tied the knot with actress Nam Hung three years after the film's release, leading to one of the most celebrated marriages in Hong Kong cinema.","popularity":0.7529,"poster_path":"/fqXGakTOBR96FeDFqgRMFktiPcE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":231272,"logo_path":null,"name":"Climax Motion Picture
