The film uses this idea in the context of how an artificial intelligence might work: the AI generates optimal solutions to user problems as a form of desire line calculation. The film aims to interrogate the increasingly controversial role of Artificial Intelligence by visualising a statement from a bot about its experience on a Valentine's Day in the near future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/v8tmmx7ikzevZtwE0NUwPNuG2RJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desire Line","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shi Ruini","original_name":"Shi Ruini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631b3e3a303c85007fca153d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9910410","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v8tmmx7ikzevZtwE0NUwPNuG2RJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
