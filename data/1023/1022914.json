He's lost substantial body weight over the cold months and hunger is now his primary motivator. In fact, except for a short period during mating season, food will be the black bear's primary focus until it returns to its den in the fall. Black bears have been known to prey on moose and dear calves but their main diet consists of much smaller fare. With up to 800 pounds of bulk to support, black bears need to feed constantly to survive and to do so they have evolved one of the most omnivorous diets on the planet. You name it, they eat it!This film follows the early cycle of the black bear's life; its hunting strategies, territorial behaviours, mating habits and feeding opportunities.The program will also explore the bear's troubled relationship with humans. Although black bears have been known to prey on humans, this is extremely rare.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":110102,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animal Planet","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Bears Trouble Bruin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
