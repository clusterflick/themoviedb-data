Three years in the making, this stunning natural history film takes us down the East Coast of Australia to the many serenely beautiful habitats of the platypus. Technology specially created for this film captures images from inside the nesting chamber of a wild platypus, and records the extraordinary sounds of the mother suckling her offspring. We watch as they grow from newborns to adulthood. Join renowned documentary makers David Parer and Elizabeth Parer-Cook (Dragons of Galapagos, Wolves of the Sea) on this fascinating journey from the rainforests of Queensland to the frozen mountains of Tasmania, as they reveal new insights into this mysterious creature.","popularity":0.409,"poster_path":"/zhJmL33govlNHkN0vTZdqspnYhS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82981,"logo_path":"/2zl1si6wU6VD0i5uOzwEai6xT1P.png","name":"Discovery Communications","origin_country":"US"},{"id":191855,"logo_path":null,"name":"ABC Natural History Unit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2003-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Platypus: World's Strangest Animal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3080886,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonathan Holmes","original_name":"Jonathan Holmes","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631c82bb67dcc9007afa899d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199387,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elizabeth Parer-Cook","original_name":"Elizabeth Parer-Cook","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d157919f51af00dc258f4d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2593373,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dione Gilmour","original_name":"Dione Gilmour","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d157b5e72fe8008e60c1f0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199386,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Parer","original_name":"David Parer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a423c6d400f3010c36ecda","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0466924","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qwjo5Usbcekd2trst6PBwpypQKz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":870,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zhJmL33govlNHkN0vTZdqspnYhS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9902,"name":"wildlife"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"ABC","release_date":"2003-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
