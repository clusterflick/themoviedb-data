She star of bright and somber melodramas. She reigned on the screens for several decades, but every kingdom has her sunset. At that twilight moment, and as if trying to escape that crossroads, Joan decides to call the notable American artist, the greatest exponent of Pop Art: Andy Warhol. Her intention is to replace her muse, Elizabeth Taylor, in the serigraphs that the artist will present at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. This intrusion will give rise to a telephone conversation where the queen of melodrama will confirm that the world has changed and that her cinematographic life in black and white is already part of an implacable past.","popularity":0.1682,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hello Andy?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3250388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejandra Radano","original_name":"Alejandra Radano","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"631a979072d8550091d113f1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Masllorens","original_name":"Ignacio Masllorens","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/p6ME16mqPTyC77E1Bdi2iawWOGc.jpg","credit_id":"631a977f326c190079fbf1fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2366939,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Juan Gatti","original_name":"Juan Gatti","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631a977162f335007b0e86ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1448756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfredo Arias","original_name":"Alfredo Arias","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/dC0s8LApXuQcTtyfPlyRi9PA5ze.jpg","credit_id":"631a97602a210c007f43c996","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":193156,"name":"pop art"},{"id":217882,"name":"joan crawford"},{"id":278486,"name":"mediometraje"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
