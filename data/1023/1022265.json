Their legends only grow. In the world of surfing, no surfer proves this point better than Californias classic son, Tom Curren. While Curren came to power in the mid 80's with back to back World Titles, he became a legend in 1990. Ater a three year hiatus he reappeared and started from scratch, dominating the world of pro surfing in a way that can never be repeated.\r It's hard to pinpoint why Curren's legacy outweighs even his three incredible titles. Kelly Slater has long, since passed him and others like Andy Irons have matched it. Maybe it's the fact that Curren won al his titles in front o huge crowds instead of on remote reefs. Perhaps its his reluctant hero appeal that adds to his mystique. Or maybe its the fact that to this day he still holds the record for more tour victories over any other surfer... even Slater.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/hxgauoYM0HnhilsqdZn4GTicOhh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Curren Trials to Title","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":982767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Curren","original_name":"Tom Curren","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":"/9Fk1MTudfV4OOgT246fCERhwASk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"631a28c41d1bf4009038c1bf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3693335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Gibby","original_name":"Alan Gibby","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631a28f5cf9ba3007ef3df59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hxgauoYM0HnhilsqdZn4GTicOhh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
