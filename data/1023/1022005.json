As the title of Setting a Good Corner (Allegory & Metaphor) suggests, Nauman sees this simple, even mundane, activity as an allegory and metaphor for other areas of life. Maybe we are to see the work as a metaphor for making a work of art, since Nauman has chosen to film it for display in a museum. One of the key elements of the video is Naumanâ€™s decision to show us the entire process. He does not leave out the long digging scenes or edit the piece down to its most essential components.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Setting a Good Corner (Allegory & Metaphor)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Nauman","original_name":"Bruce Nauman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63193b64a402c1007bc13919","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Nauman","original_name":"Bruce Nauman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63193b6ffac502007c356077","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
