Prior to his coming, T.J. researches and studies the Muslim faith as he wants to convert Mohammed to Christianity. One night, the conversation turns to the subject, and T.J. is shocked when he finds out why few Muslims ever come to Christ. This is a very, very powerful film and truly one that every professing Christian, especially in America, should see. Great truth presented.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35880,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Schmidt Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guess Who's Coming To America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darin Grebel","original_name":"Darin Grebel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"631bc5a47646fd007f08eb7d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Hailey","original_name":"Eddie Hailey","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"631bc5ada3e4ba008372f3b3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Schmidt","original_name":"John Schmidt","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631bc5bd51c01f0082b3e752","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Schmidt","original_name":"John Schmidt","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631bc5c82d8ef3007a16f02c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Schmidt","original_name":"John Schmidt","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631bc5d27646fd007affe76a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
