The history of Donbas was re-written during the Soviet era. Although the Soviet Union edited out and withheld all references to the European background of this region from history books in schools and universities. There were, in fact, numerous French, Belgian, German, British, Polish, Swiss, Dutch, and even American settlements and more than 100 wide-scale enterprises in the region. Therefore, this film reveals the pro-European industrialization of Ukrainian Donbas at the turn of the 19th century. It aims to emphasize the European roots of Ukraine long before the official integration process of Ukraine into the EU in 2022.","popularity":0.7758,"poster_path":"/raIrhVuSZ226ZqU7vvF6HSGpX32.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eurodonbas","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"ЄвроДонбас","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"EuroDonbas","type":"alternative english title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2496901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kornii Hrytsiuk","original_name":"Kornii Hrytsiuk","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/sDKUxnPBDIRnVMhUYNK3HNghRSK.jpg","credit_id":"631a7606ebb99d00823ff76f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3693675,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bohdan Kinashchuk","original_name":"Bohdan Kinashchuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631a7618a5743d008419dcc2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2496901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kornii Hrytsiuk","original_name":"Kornii Hrytsiuk","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/sDKUxnPBDIRnVMhUYNK3HNghRSK.jpg","credit_id":"631a7645a097dc007ce321a1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2143556,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Palenchuk","original_name":"Anna Palenchuk","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/uCoD38eOIe9IvhOL21ieWh8mkqh.jpg","credit_id":"64245e0b960cde0077115b36","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2496901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kornii Hrytsiuk","original_name":"Kornii Hrytsiuk","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/sDKUxnPBDIRnVMhUYNK3HNghRSK.jpg","credit_id":"64245e1c8de0ae00b652c34c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2143556,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Palenchuk","original_name":"Anna Palenchuk","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/uCoD38eOIe9IvhOL21ieWh8mkqh.jpg","credit_id":"64245e2237b3a9011364f6c2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2957018,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anton Dehtiarov","original_name":"Anton Dehtiarov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64245e42c04429021304390e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2207604,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vasyl Yavtushenko","original_name":"Василь Явтушенко","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64245e498de0ae00978b3f3b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19797962","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"eurodonbasdocumentary","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/byiqRBncMUPTxybKjPBKYNjEoTu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1282}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2797,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/m3jgOICHvc95n0Bz5uf09YEt5BB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1866},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/9YNIlkpBKuGxav08WSApld5M1b6.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/raIrhVuSZ226ZqU7vvF6HSGpX32.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2903,"name":"propaganda"},{"id":5331,"name":"village"},{"id":272265,"name":"ukraine"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kharkiv MeetDocs Eastern Ukrainian Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Трейлер документального фільму \"Євродонбас\"","key":"4hNfkG4pbTc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-05-04T08:18:39.000Z","id":"64833dd2d2b209014e084a07"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Eurodonbas documentary | Trailer","key":"679053152","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-02-18T08:49:52.000Z","id":"631a757da097dc007ce3215e"}]}}}
