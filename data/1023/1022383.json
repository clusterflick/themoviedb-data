The engine, designed to calculate and print-out tables of numbers for use in navigation, insurance, and astronomy, is considered an important artifact in the history of computing. Babbage is considered to be the father of the modern computer, and the Difference Engine and Analytical Machine are forerunners of the computer. The music is ”Alamaine” and “The Scot’s March” performed by Carl Dolmetsch and the Dolmetsch Quartet.","popularity":0.1618,"poster_path":"/zUhJKwd9YZcZEHwm3WG3i3uNbB5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Babbage’s Calculating Machine or Difference Engine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Eames","original_name":"Charles Eames","popularity":0.1759,"profile_path":"/nLh3r0QomqDHKdi1cjOwnUC8uJe.jpg","credit_id":"631a99670e5aba007fe5949a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Eames","original_name":"Ray Eames","popularity":0.134,"profile_path":"/jILIR1qMthTLZ93meHnnzw0vLrg.jpg","credit_id":"631a99750fb398007c6c0899","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zUhJKwd9YZcZEHwm3WG3i3uNbB5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Jan 1 is a substitute, year is correct","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
