Green Matters approaches eutrophication from a new perspective. Considering the enormous importance green algae had in the evolution of flora and fauna, its importance as an essential source of oxygen, and its energeticand nutritional values, it truly deserves our respect. Moreover, we can be fascinated by its beauty, when observed in its underwater surroundings. Mia Mäkelä studied green algae and their possible use applying traditional rug-making techniques. Her project aims to help the eutrophicated Baltic Sea by foraging algae and putting them to good use.","popularity":0.1016,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green Matters – A Handbook for Algae Gatherers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Mäkelä","original_name":"Mia Mäkelä","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631b8dd91511aa007bb724cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Mäkelä","original_name":"Mia Mäkelä","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631b8de6d4fe04007f867039","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Mäkelä","original_name":"Mia Mäkelä","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631b8dffa5d849007a7c8980","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Mäkelä","original_name":"Mia Mäkelä","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631b8e0933ad8f00847536b8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Mäkelä","original_name":"Mia Mäkelä","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631b8df133ad8f00847536af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694673,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jani Lehto","original_name":"Jani Lehto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631b8e440bc5290091feee51","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Mäkelä","original_name":"Mia Mäkelä","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631b8e15c8a5ac007fef549d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
