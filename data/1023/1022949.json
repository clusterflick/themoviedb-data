Akhtamar refers to the second largest of four islands on Lake Van, the historic birthplace of all Armenians. According to a tale, an Armenian princess named Tamara lived on the island and was in love with a commoner. This boy would swim from the shore to the island each night, guided by a light she lit for him. Her father learned of the boy's visits. One night, as she waited for her lover to arrive, her father smashed her light, leaving the boy in the middle of the lake without a guide to indicate which direction to swim. He drowned and his body washed ashore and, as the legend concludes, it appeared as if the words \"Akh, Tamara\" (Oh, Tamara) were frozen on his lips.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":"/okTEPTwIPh8VjYFS4KCZOMa40Pn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4484,"logo_path":"/qWC0eR60XPtyONfPQwVMKQ9pZS8.png","name":"Armenia Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1971-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Akhtamar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3757595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Baghramyan","original_name":"Irina Baghramyan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Tamar","credit_id":"63582f5b42f19f007ab89d52","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Episkoposyan","original_name":"Владимир Епископосян","popularity":0.0987,"profile_path":"/lspw63s2iVbq0vPzrq5Vs47j36C.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"63582f806654080081968a90","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3757571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernest Martirosyan","original_name":"Ernest Martirosyan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63582c1671083a007f3c4aa0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3757576,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Artashes Zalalyan","original_name":"Artashes Zalalyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63582d0725a53600823e3e6d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3757577,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"L.
