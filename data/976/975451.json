Glen (Ed Helms of The Daily Show) likes to read, do crosswords, and play basketball. He's on the lookout for a girlfriend. Oh, and one other thing-Glen is a Zombie-American. This educational documentary will help audiences understand the challenges zombies face in our society. As a plea for tolerance, it aims to clear up many of the terrible stereotypes and misconceptions we have about zombies. It is the filmmaker's hope that this film will help people understand that zombies are just like everybody else...if everybody else is a walking, talking, rotting corpse.","popularity":0.488,"poster_path":"/fRri6iw6zMkQUYCz2OFio3HGY4p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zombie-American","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Helms","original_name":"Ed Helms","popularity":1.3422,"profile_path":"/gPZ8tZaNQGAc3KZRIPp9rgGbEnN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Glen","credit_id":"6280588e848eb90067a3c02d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1230214,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Poppy","original_name":"Nick Poppy","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628058a3907f26006683a31e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1230214,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Poppy","original_name":"Nick Poppy","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628058b0fd140b569c8e6f9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1230214,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Poppy","original_name":"Nick Poppy","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628058bbcaa50813cd6a17a1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1230214,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Poppy","original_name":"Nick Poppy","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628058e0c92c5d0068b1db68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Helms","original_name":"Ed Helms","popularity":1.3422,"profile_path":"/gPZ8tZaNQGAc3KZRIPp9rgGbEnN.jpg","credit_id":"628058e9cee481006661c2f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313827,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Boebel","original_name":"Chris Boebel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6280592c848eb90051713173","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Helms","original_name":"Ed Helms","popularity":1.3422,"profile_path":"/gPZ8tZaNQGAc3KZRIPp9rgGbEnN.jpg","credit_id":"6280594f907f26005198d3d5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0780661","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fRri6iw6zMkQUYCz2OFio3HGY4p.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
