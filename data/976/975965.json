What kept him whole after the ordeal was his Buddhist faith and his dedication to Cambodian classical dance where he performs the role of Hanuman, the magical white monkey. Now a Philadelphia-area resident, Thavro travels to the Kingdom of Cambodia, a country still in turmoil, We witness his bittersweet reunion with his remaining family and teachers.
