But it's nothing like New Delhi, where she comes from. The weather is cold and grey and a terrible ice storm cuts off the power, ruining her plans for a party. Obviously, a Divali celebration now is impossible. Or is it? As Gita experiences the glittering beauty of the icy streets outside, the traditional festival of lights comes alive in a sparkling new way.","popularity":0.3609,"poster_path":"/t9aGlpYJzp9FIiQQD0LtYbF7Q8H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lights for Gita","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":198707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Smith","original_name":"Ivan Smith","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/cqBDuExrEcxT0SG0aZitX1UAmiW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"627e55c0ad59b5133cd8fd6a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shalini Singh","original_name":"Shalini Singh","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Gita","credit_id":"627e55d6caa50813ce86bdfe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Fernández","original_name":"Ken Fernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Father","credit_id":"627e55ef5aadc41364681c56","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Majella Castellano","original_name":"Majella Castellano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"627e5601c92c5d0052dd1c67","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosalind Garland","original_name":"Rosalind Garland","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Amy","credit_id":"627e560ffd140b0069d7ebe8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Vo","original_name":"Michel Vo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e54e9ad59b5133e8b0bce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547676,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Gregory Houston","original_name":"Gregory Houston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e550afd140b0069d7e8a6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sheldon Cohen","original_name":"Sheldon Cohen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2uiuvnZPb3JxGanW1ax5CvdG2st.jpg","credit_id":"627e552ec92c5d009d3c7a9b","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1819827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Renaud","original_name":"Marie Renaud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e55515aadc41363ad0d04","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547678,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Normand Gauthier","original_name":"Normand Gauthier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e5570caa50813cd62c9af","department":"Camera","job":"Digital Imaging Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sugith Varughese","original_name":"Sugith Varughese","popularity":0.3136,"profile_path":"/8fUSgYdPks13YbCkAbRqcZsBpR2.jpg","credit_id":"627e558e873f000050f34fa0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46436,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Normand Roger","original_name":"Normand Roger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e5636c92c5d0052dd1d08","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389416,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis L.
