The film was shot over eleven days, from 24 February to 6 March 2011, in a Labor Camp in Sajaa, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. Melik Ohanian built 100 meters of tracks to make traveling shots. Each day he installed the tracks and then filmed the 100 meters in approximately four minutes. The next day, he dismantled the tracks, re-assembled them and moved them 100 meters ahead â€“ and film again. He did this for eleven consecutive days, shooting both during the day and at night.  The incremental editing of the daily footage produced two singular films representing 1100 meters of space and forty-two minutes of time.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Days - I see what I saw and what I will see","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3548306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melik Ohanian","original_name":"Melik Ohanian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627ea78a6d1bb237dbc90361","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
