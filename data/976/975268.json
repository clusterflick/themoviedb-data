It spins the story of Aramotu, a wealthy female trader, who dares to stretch the boundaries that ancient myths and traditions place on the life of the women of her time. Aramotu tries to employ the social-engineering aspects of the Gelede Cult to realize her progressive ideas about the rights of women and the need for people-oriented governance in her native Agesi Village.","popularity":0.1217,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aramotu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Idiat Sobande","original_name":"Idiat Sobande","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Aramotu","credit_id":"627e4d39873f000050f336e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kayode Odumosu","original_name":"Kayode Odumosu","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Akanmu","credit_id":"627e4d65caa50813cd62b247","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ireti Osayemi-Bakare","original_name":"Ireti Osayemi-Bakare","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Iyalode","credit_id":"627e4d7a006eee34255c03c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayo Olabiyi","original_name":"Ayo Olabiyi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Olookande","credit_id":"627e4dd95aadc413646805b6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1680724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Afolayan","original_name":"Gabriel Afolayan","popularity":0.1427,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Gbegiro","credit_id":"627e4dfc20e6a534880bf89e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tunbosun Odunsi","original_name":"Tunbosun Odunsi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Head Chief","credit_id":"627e4e26006eee34255c056a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3111337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Fatomilola","original_name":"Peter Fatomilola","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"627e4f0f5aadc41363acfc2d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bisi Komolafe","original_name":"Bisi Komolafe","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"627e4f1ecaa50813cfa56512","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731766,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Niji Akanni","original_name":"Niji Akanni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e4cc7fd140b0053b0b6d7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731766,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Niji Akanni","original_name":"Niji Akanni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e4cbafd140b0053b0b6a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547632,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ramesh Babu Raparthy","original_name":"Ramesh Babu Raparthy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e4cf5dcf875004f9600ba","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547633,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Abimbola Taiwo","original_name":"Abimbola Taiwo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e4d07fd140b00acc292f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547631,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Femi Ogunrombi","original_name":"Femi Ogunrombi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e4cdf5aadc41363acf550","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
