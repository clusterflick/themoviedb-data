He shoots a film in Morocco, which will allow him to find the top of the bill. But nothing goes right, his partner, Alexi, breaks his arm during the shooting of a scene. Later, a phone call puts him in all his states: Julie, his ex-wife, who is a scriptwriter, asks him to keep their young films, Mathias and Victor. She has to go to Hollywood where she is nominated for an Oscar. Philippe is furious, but agrees to receive them in Morocco. Always absent, he does not know his children well. They have the (false) impression that their father does not love them. So, they do stupid things. And when a set catches fire, Philippe is certain that his children are responsible for the fire.","popularity":0.184,"poster_path":"/yztEzVAhdlS6dqoiAzCf8uf4xlF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1996-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Papa est un mirage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Weber","original_name":"Jacques Weber","popularity":0.215,"profile_path":"/xORNQKmduTsIc1Sq40mnOz3Zo5K.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Philippe","credit_id":"627df863caa5080067bbf9eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":123611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Élisabeth Vitali","original_name":"Élisabeth Vitali","popularity":0.2897,"profile_path":"/2hydpVewqqe3fxbubCMm365gYVV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"627df86e3af9290065aaf294","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gautier Kusnierek","original_name":"Gautier Kusnierek","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Victor","credit_id":"627df8785aadc41362e682db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexis Pivot","original_name":"Alexis Pivot","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/gFZK0XgKhmWiKWtGuYqeCMILtGq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mathias","credit_id":"627df881006eee15063c08f1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238766,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Didier Grousset","original_name":"Didier Grousset","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627df839006eee15028b71c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0268522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yztEzVAhdlS6dqoiAzCf8uf4xlF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
