The image in APPEARANCE seems to 'grow' very gradually from the bottom centre of the frame upwards, as the mist clears and the image reveals itself, presenting a reflexive and phenomenological encounter for the viewer. The tree is also 'growing' to become one of the most important symbols for the anthropocene. APPEARANCE continues my exploration of experimental and observational landscape films and the relationship between light, duration and visual transformation.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/hV5wT3ZtG5eEtKmtjrHvpzQjVAw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Appearance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1707437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Woodman","original_name":"John Woodman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627ee37e2dc9dc009eecda29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hV5wT3ZtG5eEtKmtjrHvpzQjVAw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
