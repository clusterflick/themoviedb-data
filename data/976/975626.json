Hudec (1893-1958), a famous architect in Shanghai. For the first time Alessa visits Slovakia the birthplace of her father. Together with her brother Theo, they decide to visit China after 63 years - the country of their childhood and youth. This inspired documentary not only explores the many exciting details of the life of L.E. Hudec, father of Asian high-rises, but also serves as an authentic testimony of life of Europeans in Colonial Shanghai before The People's Republic of China was formed. It presents the never-before-seen 16mm home-movies that were shot between 1927-1938 by Ladislav Hudec himself.","popularity":0.0798,"poster_path":"/3ZvhHWEIXmwhl1zqvMWXg7w9dq9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Changed Shanghai","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Změnil tvář Šanghaje","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2082289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ladislav Kaboš","original_name":"Ladislav Kaboš","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64399f06be4b36053f35edbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1602178,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bohumil Martinák","original_name":"Bohumil Martinák","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64399f3829383504f7a996f4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1754660","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.745,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ZvhHWEIXmwhl1zqvMWXg7w9dq9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":559}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
