It reflects community harmony, cooperation, and balance. This sensitive documentary is an American musician's unique portrait of Balinese life, art, and spirituality. Focusing on the concept of Taksu, or the spiritual power found in music, instruments, costumes, and dance, the film captures the vibrant rhythm that permeates all Balinese art and culture and suggests how the daily activities of the Balinese echo the tempo and interlocking harmonies of their music. 'Taksu' will enhance numerous classes in cultural anthropology, Asian and Balinese studies, comparative religion, and ethnomusicology.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taksu: Music in the Life of Bali","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3550204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jann Pasler","original_name":"Jann Pasler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62806c0ecaa50813ce8e40f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
