Taking the form of a free-wheeling journey around the world (10 films, 10 cities), the project invites us to observe in detail the multiple forms and complex interactions that exist every day between people and their urban environments.  Somewhere between visual anthropology and observational cinema, these films put urban man under the microscope and encourage us to take a closer look at individual and collective behaviour, interpersonal dynamics, social tensions, and the economic and political forces that play out every day on the grand stage of the city streets.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bqfmB1hamLrL5SVWpVw0QFZ06Kx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homo Urbanus Petroburgumus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bqfmB1hamLrL5SVWpVw0QFZ06Kx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Agora Biennale de Bordeaux","release_date":"2017-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
