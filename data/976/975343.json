Possibly filmed by John 'Mad Jack' Benett-Stanford on behalf of the Warwick Trading Company, it is a forerunner of the military films that would shortly flood the screens of Great Britain with the outbreak of the Boer War.  Benett-Stanford, an Etonian turned career serviceman, was on active service in the Sudan and doubled as a war correspondent. According to legend, he was shot while attempting to get a picture of the enemy. It seems, though, that even beside the showmen and chancers of the early film industry, 'Mad Jack' had a gift for exaggeration.","popularity":0.0578,"poster_path":"/j0vvAPDTyZ8ksgQPDfefM93Wc4f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1898-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Seaforth Highlanders' Return to Cairo after the Fall of Omdurman and Khartoum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1482416,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Benett-Stanford","original_name":"John Benett-Stanford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627e87dd6d1bb237da93542e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j0vvAPDTyZ8ksgQPDfefM93Wc4f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1898-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
