The flight was hijacked by terrorists and crashed as part of four coordinated attacks in the United States that fateful day. Containing real accounts from witnesses and family members of those on board, as well as acted scenes showing what likely took place inside the aircraft, this documentary is harrowing, heartbreaking and moving in every way. This documentary also reminds us to never forget 9/11/01 and all of the innocent victims we lost that day.","popularity":0.187,"poster_path":"/lOYIY2jn9wei2Nosn9tt6BWbnrY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's Roll: The Story of Flight 93","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0416917","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lOYIY2jn9wei2Nosn9tt6BWbnrY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":192772,"name":"historical drama"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
