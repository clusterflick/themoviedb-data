Looking back on this film I see Ernie Steeles, O.K. Hotel, Virginia Inn, The Viaduct and James Carboâ€™s eastlake silver house all gone now. This film is different from the films I made before .. and the films I have made after. I was grateful to Pony Mourice for agreeing to be in this picture, if it wasn't for her the film never would have been made because she was the only one I could picture in my mind to be in my film.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/4EaBRBxFBfk7gvctMsfud59d0Z7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Symmetry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1661589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Behrens","original_name":"Jon Behrens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xhZ7SNE1NU8ORphuH2vM4NE69Tk.jpg","credit_id":"627ea952fd140b0053b1df8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":984,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4EaBRBxFBfk7gvctMsfud59d0Z7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":657}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
