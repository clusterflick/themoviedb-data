They receive a proposition from Henrietta Joyce, Mrs. Joyce's wealthy sister-in-law, to take Trixie as a companion, feed and clothe her and in place of wages, send her mother an allowance sufficient to support the rest of the family. Both realize it is the solution of a hard problem, and Trixie accepts the offer. Henrietta is close-fisted and selfish in money matters, but she also has a strain of morbidly-romantic sentiment in her nature, so the largest part of Trixie's work is reading aloud to her mistress quantities of swashbuckling, mid-Victorian novels.","popularity":0.1631,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Too Much Burglar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Costello","original_name":"Maurice Costello","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/92Q6cg7efdgMrmNbGNXBoF2hrpB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tom Perry","credit_id":"627e87ec20e6a534880cb9ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolores Costello","original_name":"Dolores Costello","popularity":0.2072,"profile_path":"/xEsZUdwjqZdIWi2yWDo8mC6Ugt0.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"627e8869ad59b5133d8663b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1047595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helene Costello","original_name":"Helene Costello","popularity":0.1336,"profile_path":"/3SvCiydhPLPyQtWIoEQtsRoBYt.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"627e8859c92c5d0068aae467","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Morrison","original_name":"James Morrison","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/74FZiGds3xQqRB7Ee0WJLqMzee1.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"627e882cc92c5d009d3d2ecb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1419855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwina Robbins","original_name":"Edwina Robbins","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/3xRPDS4naTmELYLhI4D2nK8KLj6.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"627e8837fd140b00acc373c7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eulalie Jensen","original_name":"Eulalie Jensen","popularity":0.2186,"profile_path":"/jdWAELPJ5Q8W8HW8rLDLciVKdIN.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"627e884e6d1bb237dc5c5c19","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2403925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estelle Mardo","original_name":"Estelle Mardo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Trixie Joyce","credit_id":"627e880020e6a5348678334d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Gaillard","original_name":"Robert Gaillard","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/m5QWpQiBXRETL3ujyamQdykNkhh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"627e880cc92c5d0068aae399","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas R.
