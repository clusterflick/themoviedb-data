In this documentary series, \"Papa\" Auwae shares this traditional knowledge. At a workshop, he demonstrates the preparation of healing herbs and mineral rock (ʻalaea). And in a visit to the Wao Kele o Puna rainforest, he identifies rare medicinal plants and speaks to the importance of preserving them in their natural habitat. This digitally remastered DVD replaces the original 33-minute program from 1991. The expanded documentary and bonus features contain virtually all of the footage recorded of Henry Auwae at the Hawaiian Health Fair held in Hilo, Hawaiʻi on May 5, 1990 along with footage recorded at this residence in Keaukaha, and during a drive to and hike through the Wao Kele o Puna rainforest on September 27, 1989.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hawaiian Art of Healing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2788584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Lander","original_name":"Joan Lander","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62806b7f6d1bb25924701c82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2788583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Puhipau","original_name":"Puhipau","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62806b866d000c009cc5b028","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
