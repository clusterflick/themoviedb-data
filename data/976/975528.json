Her creativity seems to be hibernating, thanks to a series of awful relationships and the general mood of the season. But when she meets Eddie, a 25 year-old Lakota man, and law school dropout, he could be just the tonic for her winter blues. But Eddie’s a complex person, so complex, in fact, that the two of them may end up searching for something that will end their romance. Self-described as “A modern day, inter-tribal, love story that shows true love is found in the season you love yourself,” A Winter Love is an eye-opening romantic drama filmed in Minnesota.","popularity":0.2457,"poster_path":"/8ytcGttWEl8Jqd1he9oB0cEzYpX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Winter Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1588915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhiana Yazzie","original_name":"Rhiana Yazzie","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Blue","credit_id":"65302edbedeb4300c48fc6e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4327537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Watson","original_name":"Brian Watson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Eddie","credit_id":"65302f64edeb4300c48fc71d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3080461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Michael Carney","original_name":"Christopher Michael Carney","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Chris","credit_id":"627f2c3d006eee34255fba4e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2098514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Galick","original_name":"Alex Galick","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/isApEWkuxM0WHskklRxSCxJ4urS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pari","credit_id":"627f2c902b93200050e03c9f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3548760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Connor D.
