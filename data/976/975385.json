Born as an artistic commission for the Agora Biennale in Bordeaux around the theme of the moving landscapes, these videos plunge into cities in a spontaneous and subjective approach with very modest means in order to translate in the closest possible way the feel of their constant moving nature: their human landscape.  Presented in a comparative dynamic through the lens of a selection of themes and issues linked with the street daily life, the videos enable us to perceive each of these different urban contexts as an experimental, local and unique laboratory answering the same global challenge of how can we live all together.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hpXhAE3nAp5f1Dtg2JxZBrA3XJv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homo Urbanus Shanghaianus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hpXhAE3nAp5f1Dtg2JxZBrA3XJv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"arc en rÃªve centre d'architecture","release_date":"2020-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
