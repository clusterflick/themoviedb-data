They're best friends trying to make it out on the streets after being kicked out of their homes. Left to fend for themselves, there are more bad days than good, but they both still daydream of a brighter future. Although everything seems bleak, they promise that they'll always be there for each other, which seems to give them both hope... But how long will that hope last? Mia Moore delivers food to someone and is surprised when she recognizes the recipient as Paige Owens, an old friend. But their chat is cut short when Mia has to leave to drop off another order. A few days later, Mia shows up again at Paige's house to deliver more food.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vuy8wjxM3gyAY3guV75mudeBLoy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/p4SuncmnR1bxoA6GNVEA4tQIn4y.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Let Me Help You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1903886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Claire","original_name":"Evelyn Claire","popularity":145.219,"profile_path":"/gJWQ1gfCrjGdI9ZFMgSOD1ElPwS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"655c64def6787a01008c80aa","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2066288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gia Derza","original_name":"Gia Derza","popularity":12.152,"profile_path":"/hSrFY88Oy1QP2GQdBOxaeJlLqwl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"655c64e653866e00e2961796","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2973480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mia Moore","original_name":"Mia Moore","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/whzdqhWE8Lr3Cay3tQksYt5AL5w.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"655c64f33d745400c637ee1f","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2140280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paige Owens","original_name":"Paige Owens","popularity":8.741,"profile_path":"/2P9YGN8CHGYHXvsIfdZOp6nOohr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"655c64fdf6787a00aece02c5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1647480,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bree Mills","original_name":"Bree Mills","popularity":2.24,"profile_path":"/ql5DBazbVozMqktpcFv7aby2I0F.jpg","credit_id":"655c650b10923000c471b38a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":579085,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kay Brandt","original_name":"Kay Brandt","popularity":1.882,"profile_path":"/bMzf9tmOXLV4uNOP50TqyYTQ205.jpg","credit_id":"655c651653866e011c0aba8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vuy8wjxM3gyAY3guV75mudeBLoy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
