However, a terrible curse called the \"Curse of Neveren\" was cast upon them, ensuring that war would never end in their land. Before the empire started to decline, Emperor Gatotcaka came up with a plan for the future, which spanned 20 years before his death.

He believed that these individuals held the key to restoring the empire to its former greatness and prosperity.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/gQBBfuZzbJyjcrYMsQeaNCehXJl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Farafog
