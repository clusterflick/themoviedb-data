SEND KELP! follows Frances on an odyssey that brings her into the vast oceans of the Pacific where she intends to build one of the first farms of its kind in British Columbia.  But to coax a crop from the wild Pacific, she’ll need help from scientists, wild harvesters, and entrepreneurs who know the challenges and astonishing potential of this miraculous organism. And along the way, she’ll find a glimmer of the hope that seaweed might provide not only for our planet, but for her, too.","popularity":0.0568,"poster_path":"/9bBWvZUz6e9mLtES4YKRMo2xFMb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A bootstrapping seaweed nerd takes on climate change and global food insecurity armed with nothing but determination when she sets out to start her own kelp farm.","title":"Send Kelp!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"해초를 구해줘!","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273246,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Blake McWilliam","original_name":"Blake McWilliam","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655f756b1dbc88013be44c0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1434,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9bBWvZUz6e9mLtES4YKRMo2xFMb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International Eco Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
