In this way, the concept of linear perspective we have had since the Renaissance is replaced by a new system of perspective, the ‘water-drop perspective-system'. Question: is this film a sort of two-dimensional virtual reality? Answer: no, virtual reality means that we construct our artificial world. I am much more interested in the surrounding real world. In this case, it is the world of my daughter.  - Tamás Waliczky","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vBNkTWJmzU7gyS6ZzDrG6oZy8YQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Garden: 21st Century Amateur Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4390117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annamária Waliczky","original_name":"Annamária Waliczky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Child","credit_id":"655d218cd4fe0400c425d63f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4389602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamás Waliczky","original_name":"Tamás Waliczky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655ce1ac53866e00c5b55d62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1300,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vBNkTWJmzU7gyS6ZzDrG6oZy8YQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":867}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"*second version somewhere in 1996, don't have exact information","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
