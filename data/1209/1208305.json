Jack hopes to persuade the ex-pro Simon to slow down and discover some parts of the region he previously missed, as the pair cycle from Chepstow to Hereford - a ride that Simon can smash in two hours. Will Jack be able to convert Simon to a more leisurely way of cycling?  The pair follow the course of the Wye taking in the historical sights and sounds along the way.  They attempt to spot falcons in the limestone gorges, take a dip in the chilly river, and finally visit the largest medieval map of the world - the Hereford Mappa Mundi.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1CDz7FCxaka0EnyzPIbYxB44Tu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slow Cycling: Episode 4 - The Wye Valley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mnC0EqxXn6mIsC448kzvFYq2YeB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1CDz7FCxaka0EnyzPIbYxB44Tu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Slow Cycling: Episode 4 The Wye Valley","key":"zPIaF90qy_E","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-06-27T23:00:31.000Z","id":"657242136dc6c000aeb581f6"}]}}}
