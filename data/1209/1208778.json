Instigated by corrupt officials and the media, the villagers are inclined to believe that Avni, a tigress from the neighbouring forest, is responsible for the deaths. Avni is then labelled a man-eater without any evidence and this irresponsible act puts her life in danger, as fearful villagers call for her execution. Mihir Ghosh, a tiger conservationist from the city, works with his friends in the local Forest Department and with village leaders to educate the people about coexisting with wildlife. While the country is divided into people who support the execution and others who protest it, Mihir and his friends challenge the official narrative intended to slander Avni, and work towards uncovering the agenda behind the shoot-to-kill order.","popularity":0.0818,"poster_path":"/kkOmHpSfg17o8wTrsOYeRB0ogLm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avni’s Fate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanjay Suri","original_name":"Sanjay Suri","popularity":0.1915,"profile_path":"/8TYltbXF7cKRnH719rSek6YznJQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"655e74f0b2681f00fe742704","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2472237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashlesha Thakur","original_name":"Ashlesha Thakur","popularity":0.4118,"profile_path":"/cu3uUco7xRa4UZnMvP6dtrQnOby.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"655e7500706e5600fe010cae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4391630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pratap Madhavrao Phad","original_name":"Pratap Madhavrao Phad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"655e750d83ee6701f9ea9cb6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4391632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitalee Jagtap Varadkar","original_name":"Mitalee Jagtap Varadkar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"655e752f706e5600e151448f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4391634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shonet Anthony Barretto","original_name":"Shonet Anthony Barretto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655e7549180dea013c3dfa9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4082700,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Asit Ghosh","original_name":"Asit Ghosh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655e75641dbc88013be3cff3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4391636,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diana Ghosh","original_name":"Diana Ghosh","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655e7579706e5600fe010ccc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kkOmHpSfg17o8wTrsOYeRB0ogLm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
