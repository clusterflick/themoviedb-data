Raised by his grandmother in humble conditions, he was inspired by the sight of Marines visiting his community. Farrow’s determination led him to join the Marine Corps, where he faced the challenges of Montford Point boot camp, eventually becoming an expert marksman and retiring as a Gunnery Sergeant. Although he never saw combat, a fact he attributed to his wife’s prayers, he realized the significance of his journey when he witnessed black officers rising in the ranks. Farrow's story is a testament to perseverance and the pursuit of one's dreams, encouraging others not to give up on their aspirations despite austere beginnings and social injustice.","popularity":0.1149,"poster_path":"/eOOpG5Ozi66qeVk1btauEvue9Yr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Against all odds, Roosevelt Farrow's inspiring journey from humble beginnings to becoming a U.S. Marine and witnessing the historic rise of black officers serves as a testament to perseverance and the pursuit of dreams in this heartfelt film.","title":"The Gunnery:  A Montford Point Marine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4389752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gunnery Farrow","original_name":"Gunnery Farrow","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Gunnery Farrow","credit_id":"655cfb2253866e00c5b56467","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298796,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Trevor Getz","original_name":"Trevor Getz","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655cfb55f6787a01008cb2f4","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
