LOVER, LOVERS, LOVING, LOVE concentrates mostly on the idea of plant sex, mating, plant love, and reproduction to foreground the making of life as the inevitable making of death. The film will mix live action as well as continuous and discontinuous stroboscopic techniques.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lover, Lovers, Loving, Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jodie Mack","original_name":"Jodie Mack","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zk3T9JCTkYaPZKW4fkdqBWEs1gC.jpg","credit_id":"655c31dbf6787a011d5edc1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
