Focuses on the creation of a bronze portrait of the Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko, the founder of the conservatory in Kyiv. The entire process of sculpting in the lost-wax method is shown (from the plasticene stage through to casting) and explained in the voice-over narration. Mol himself talks about his art and his philosophy of life, and some of Lysenko's music is played on the soundtrack.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/y06gKeQ26Mnio3XGlWJwDphVGQK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214018,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmart Productions, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leo Mol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Immortal Image","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4389267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Tapper","original_name":"Max Tapper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"655c953eb5400214d27e6ff4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4389268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Mol","original_name":"Leo Mol","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"self","credit_id":"655c955353866e00ff0a97a5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3878500,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mykola Lysenko","original_name":"Микола Лисенко","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/g38iRghulZx1JX0lHYfv8h2Es4W.jpg","credit_id":"655c93fdf6787a00e30cfc7d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Slavko Nowytski","original_name":"Slavko Nowytski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655c94a9b5400214d82ed6c1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Slavko Nowytski","original_name":"Slavko Nowytski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655c8df3d4fe04011b947ed6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Slavko Nowytski","original_name":"Slavko Nowytski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655c94663d7454013be61499","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":982,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y06gKeQ26Mnio3XGlWJwDphVGQK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":654}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ukrainian Canadian Leo Mol 1978 shows how he creates a sculpture English language","key":"IpriyOiueAs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-10-01T16:23:25.000Z","id":"655c8dfd53866e00abaeb6ba"}]}}}
