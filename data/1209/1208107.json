They were created through the interaction of powerful volcanic, geological and biological processes that have been changing the face of the earth for billions of years. This is what the Earth might have looked like four billion years ago. Iceland is the realm of ice and fire. Nowhere else is there such a high density of volcanoes. The landscapes, which are continually reshaped by eruptions, make the island a natural laboratory full of clues about the formation and development of the earth. The documentary follows a group of scientists through the most active areas of Iceland, along a mountain range that has emerged from the ocean. On the slopes of the volcanoes, in the fog of the fumaroles and on streams and rivers, the three researchers explore how the first forms of life populated the earth's surface and in what evolutionary steps they took over the earth.","popularity":0.9908,"poster_path":"/yAZbHnGaKMZXoOkpu6bZtkyKNpy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75812,"logo_path":"/7uSMofnZkEkGhDn9S8QcQ3ns8jd.png","name":"Grand
