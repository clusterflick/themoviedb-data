Joining him is former professional, Dan Martin, who battled to a top 10 finish there at the Giro dâ€™Italia in 2010.  One of the toughest mountains in Italy, the Zoncolan was once considered too difficult for the Giro. It has featured eight times since its first appearance in the 1997 Giro Donne, but its hellish gradients immediately earned it a reputation as a bucket list climb to be feared by both amateurs and professional riders.  This brutal climb averages an eye-watering 11.9% for 10.1km.  WorldTour rider Alessandro De Marchi and journalist Antonio Simeoli, who both grew up at the foot of Monte Zoncolan,  reveal why a climb so punishing is still so loved by the locals.","popularity":0.076,"poster_path":"/g0WepZ7qDD4O7i3bbayf7Dom32u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mountains: Zoncolan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4200170,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Simon Richardson","original_name":"Simon Richardson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/l9mn6oCzkoUelX4NWseGxF02X31.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65723b786c849200c98244db","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2rFfFcdVM8orYFoRU1VTcBccNjA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g0WepZ7qDD4O7i3bbayf7Dom32u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mountains: Zoncolan","key":"sJO1ApMSdo4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-18T09:10:20.000Z","id":"65723b61f28838011c43d3e5"}]}}}
