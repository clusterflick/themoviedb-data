Women find themselves behind bars for various crimes ranging from violence in self-defense to drug trafficking, breaking-and-entering & driving under the influence. Many then get stuck in a pattern of re-offending and repeated jail stints. ‘Criminalising Women’ follows three Australian ladies who have been released from prison. The feature traces their rehabilitation into society, and how they navigate an institutional system that is designed to punish them, instead of bringing about a change in individuals.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Criminalising Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4388908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Brissenden","original_name":"Michael Brissenden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655c584f53866e00ff0a7e1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10355970","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
