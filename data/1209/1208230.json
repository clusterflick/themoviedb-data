This is an impartial and friendly story about how the capital of Russia lives, works, studies and relaxes, seen through the eyes of a foreigner. The film's host, American actor Jed Allan, familiar to many Russians for his role as CC Capwell in the TV series Santa Barbara, travels around the multimillion-dollar metropolis, accompanied by the Russian actor and athlete Alexander Nevsky. The presenters of the film are equally interested in the opinions of representatives of the modern elite and ordinary citizens. The daily life of the city is the main interest of the film's authors; the faces snatched by the cameraman from the Moscow crowd are his main characters. The idea of the film is to show modern Moscow as one of the brightest, most beautiful and most dynamically developing cities in the world.","popularity":0.1508,"poster_path":"/yfTfkgCsH42AuufS6sl5m33abVz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87722,"logo_path":null,"name":"Czar Pictures","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2005-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey from Santa Barbara to Moscow, or the Adventures of an American in Russia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jed Allan","original_name":"Jed Allan","popularity":0.5059,"profile_path":"/tNZQGzbMwwvXrnThbTon4ukqo8K.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"655cad20f6787a011d5f0e73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Nevsky","original_name":"Alexander Nevsky","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":"/gm0ul2fVDs95DBNDUMhw4AAYHJM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"655cad26109230011b45b6ce","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2051369,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander Izotov","original_name":"Alexander Izotov","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/vAwAZdliezGmqfcRGBoend9vN0S.jpg","credit_id":"655cad1910923000ab49b759","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Nevsky","original_name":"Alexander Nevsky","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":"/gm0ul2fVDs95DBNDUMhw4AAYHJM.jpg","credit_id":"655cad000816c700e01cc79c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2051369,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander Izotov","original_name":"Alexander Izotov","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/vAwAZdliezGmqfcRGBoend9vN0S.jpg","credit_id":"655cacf953866e00c5b54bc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yfTfkgCsH42AuufS6sl5m33abVz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
