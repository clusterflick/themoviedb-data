On a scale from 0 to 10, embellished with colors, or by awarding pretty, playful little stars. A simple, mechanical and painless action for the rater. But behind this harmless gesture lies a brutal management system, operated directly by the customer, without their knowledge. Even more worrying: without knowing it, we are all being rated, to feed the algorithms of opaque companies that claim to be able to predict the future. The film questions this invasion of rating systems, and the consequences of this practice for our individual realities and collective freedoms.","popularity":0.4916,"poster_path":"/mKgN7mGtsqxGf9W9BvSrZJmbzUq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":6293,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Générale de Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un Monde 5 Étoiles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1281819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Lesaffre","original_name":"Sofia Lesaffre","popularity":0.3229,"profile_path":"/iEGrrbocSei2yIWxDUeDe50paGB.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6713a4610cb6252f99084ac7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ismaël Halissat","original_name":"Ismaël Halissat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713a1a799f22f326aad0741","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Coquaz","original_name":"Vincent Coquaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713a1bed5b7926e946fb581","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Coquaz","original_name":"Vincent Coquaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713a1e5650248b9db620c9f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5009452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ismaël Halissat","original_name":"Ismaël Halissat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713a1f12bbba65f7b10c61b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2227900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alix Bayle","original_name":"Alix Bayle","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713a2052bbba65f7b10c635","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3331164,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Antoine Kerninon","original_name":"Antoine Kerninon","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713a211c6e304096195d4d9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3331164,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Antoine Kerninon","original_name":"Antoine Kerninon","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713a22999f22f326aad0774","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2951428,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Vincent Défossé","original_name":"Vincent Défossé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713a23fc6e304096195d52b","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3331155,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Grégoire Terrier","original_name":"Grégoire Terrier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713fd33c6e304096195f35a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uLPdCmPz7H3KGjAEcHc5TGvCKEW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":7.031,"height":64,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fSHVoLdmpNIDLHeBbDQmfYjhv8z.png","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":450}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mKgN7mGtsqxGf9W9BvSrZJmbzUq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3679,"name":"society"},{"id":41131,"name":"rating"},{"id":187265,"name":"management"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
