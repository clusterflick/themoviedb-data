Urban life is portrayed as a series of rituals: coming of age in an environment shaped by generations, obscured by the constant barrage of everyday life. The film randomly touches upon key events familiar to everyone in North America, a melting pot of human experiences. As in any city there is an aspect of alienation, here displayed through the eyes of a young woman caught in the web of her own daily existence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1RdmDaGMXX9eUTjBBvMNRPPwZdu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ville - quelle ville?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1360907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Midi Onodera","original_name":"Midi Onodera","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/uzmvxdgeTp0wU7Qasw4WZhWfZjL.jpg","credit_id":"655c2a3f1092300138c7df3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1274,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1RdmDaGMXX9eUTjBBvMNRPPwZdu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":896}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
