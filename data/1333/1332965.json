He grows up with Mimmo, his best friend, with whom he shares everything until adolescence. One day he finds a book, which becomes almost a magical object that will change the course of his life. Francesco has a dream and he will find the courage to pursue it against everything and everyone: not only the society around him, that makes him feel trapped in a labyrinth of unwritten psychological and social rules, but also against Mimmo.","popularity":0.042,"poster_path":"/jonONyJnrSCxsNmzGD19RsXQg7Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Life
