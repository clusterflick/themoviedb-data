Their post-bop music is generally funky (although \"Freefall\" is an uptempo cooker) and sometimes a bit bombastic yet is never predictable. Trumpeter Randy Brecker and tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker take many fiery solos while also sounding warm on ballads. They are supported by a particularly strong rhythm section. In addition, the WDR Big Band contributes 14 horns and a guitar to accompany the core group.","popularity":0.0402,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Brecker Brothers - Some Skunk Funk (Live at Leverkusener Jazztage 2003)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1079843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Brecker","original_name":"Michael Brecker","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"55c45032925141667e001243","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":559719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Brecker","original_name":"Randy Brecker","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/rhu8s5BD9MDb5d558AyuehdCM3n.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"55c4503c92514166770010e4","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
