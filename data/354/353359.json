In a normal, free-ranging environment, the rat is more than a match for its hosts and colonies flourish. Under abnormal conditions of restricted space and limited food, a rat colony loses all 'social' constraints on behaviour. The film has implicit analogies for all animal behaviour, including humanity's. Plagues, predators and extermination attempts are among the topics discussed.","popularity":0.263,"poster_path":"/jerzZhlO6OnTLIQFAevSfPvE3Bb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ratopolis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1494373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Therien","original_name":"Gilles Therien","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55c3d7aac3a3681991000037","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1494373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Therien","original_name":"Gilles Therien","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed7c5318ddc340021db4c18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1494373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Therien","original_name":"Gilles Therien","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed7c57121c4ca0021e5fbb7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q18516241","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":958,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jerzZhlO6OnTLIQFAevSfPvE3Bb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":639}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":189359,"name":"rat"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
