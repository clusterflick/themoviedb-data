Thought lost until quite recently, this inscrutably-titled film is described as a 'pop fantasy' and offers an intriguing look at 60s sex and politics from a black British perspective.","popularity":0.1351,"poster_path":"/zeT35NWO9cIdrvveOb4H1PIcIhc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109077,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stria Films","origin_country":""},{"id":214538,"logo_path":null,"name":"Space Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1969-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death May Be Your Santa Claus","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Gajadhar","original_name":"Ken Gajadhar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ba537c4c3a368083a01aeb2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donnah Dolce","original_name":"Donnah Dolce","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ba537cbc3a368083401d331","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1498278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merdelle Jordine","original_name":"Merdelle Jordine","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ba537d20e0a26323401ba02","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":149006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie Dymon","original_name":"Frankie Dymon","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55c31c84c3a3686d22001803","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132213,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bob Ferguson","original_name":"Bob Ferguson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba53948c3a368083401d6d7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":149006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie Dymon","original_name":"Frankie Dymon","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba539260e0a26322c01c202","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132214,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christopher Wade","original_name":"Christopher Wade","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba5395c0e0a26322901c1ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47981,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Clive Tickner","original_name":"Clive Tickner","popularity":0.0963,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e363ed6091e620d164dbd43","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0064216","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5lvzogGMqEevFgT6ivxltfNSI27.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zeT35NWO9cIdrvveOb4H1PIcIhc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
