A person had to be careful in the country if he didn’t want to be denounced, but when he went to the doctor he knew he wouldn’t pay for prescriptions; and the bus cost a crown fifty, not ten like today.”","popularity":0.1462,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2002-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Village B.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":441778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filip Remunda","original_name":"Filip Remunda","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/ypMRhjfGgMZ0MCIkdba61bsyfui.jpg","credit_id":"55c0e92cc3a36823f700217c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1806207,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Filip Novák","original_name":"Filip Novák","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ddd121c433ea01863d2c1f","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":441778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filip Remunda","original_name":"Filip Remunda","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/ypMRhjfGgMZ0MCIkdba61bsyfui.jpg","credit_id":"65ddd116903c520149bb648b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2458545,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Helena Machová","original_name":"Helena Machová","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ddd13c7776f0016310b3f1","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":441778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filip Remunda","original_name":"Filip Remunda","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/ypMRhjfGgMZ0MCIkdba61bsyfui.jpg","credit_id":"5db8903b2d37210015e9cfc0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1460311,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jakub Voves","original_name":"Jakub Voves","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db890a20792e10015460846","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351587,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Matiášek","original_name":"Martin Matiášek","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db89058a1d3320017e83de5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222791,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matouš Outrata","original_name":"Matouš Outrata","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":"/h19ow5crWzsPxKhxnauP4bNxIrr.jpg","credit_id":"5db890aea1d3320017e83e68","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1588654,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lukáš Moudrý","original_name":"Lukáš Moudrý","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db890db2d37210015e9d163","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1582776,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juraj Mravec","original_name":"Juraj Mravec","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db890ea3faba000193ad7df","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0328202","wikidata_id":"Q12041892","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":280617,"name":"student film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Karlovy Vary International Film Festival","release_date":"2002-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ČT2","release_date":"2002-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
