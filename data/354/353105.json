The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) subsequently transformed Yard A at California State Prison into The Progressive Programming Facility, which inmates call The Honor Yard. The only one of its kind in the United States, this experimental prison yard is free of violence, racial tensions, gang activity and illegal drug and alcohol use.","popularity":0.2096,"poster_path":"/oPfc0GFio0Of2R8J4yuIpj7rvir.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toe Tag Parole: To Live and Die on Yard A","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Raymond","original_name":"Alan Raymond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55c1eb879251410f78004af1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1059122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Raymond","original_name":"Susan Raymond","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55c1eb719251410f78004aed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5060770","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oPfc0GFio0Of2R8J4yuIpj7rvir.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kQ4aUC1SFLahqgGfTU2nvQujT58.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Toe Tag Parole: To Live and Die on Yard A (HBO Documentary Films)","key":"_E4cX-RiG_k","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2015-07-15T13:48:54.000Z","id":"626a459f23168c00a0ec4ad4"}]}}}
