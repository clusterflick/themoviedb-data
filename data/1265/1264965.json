Due to global warming, the air, the sea, and the way of life in the Mediterranean are rapidly changing. Simultaneously, individuals from all walks of society and numerous organizations are working to minimize the adverse effects of global warming in the region.

Wine Dark Sea leaves the audience pondering this question: will we live in the shadow of the once-beautiful dream of the Mediterranean, unable to find solutions to environmental issues?
