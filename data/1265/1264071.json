Mischievous, funny-looking, thin, hunchbacked creatures, sometimes wearing a long pointy hat or even having big bat-like wings, Cypriots were terrified of Kalikangiaroi.  Kalikangiaroi hide in the depths of the earth all year long and rarely come above the ground. However, come Christmas day they surface and their crazy reign begins for 12 long days and nights. Their favorite pastime is to play pranks, tease and cause trouble to humans and create mayhem with the sole purpose of having fun! They playfully tease people by tugging at their clothes, scare them with their screeching voices or frighten domestic animals. One thing Kalikangiaroi loves more than teasing is a piece of “loukaniko” traditional sausage.","popularity":0.1178,"poster_path":"/laGXS4MuSwOUidrN5IZEdyT19rJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visit Cyprus","origin_country":""},{"id":224389,"logo_path":null,"name":"Heartland of Legends","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CY","name":"Cyprus"}],"release_date":"2021-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kalikangiaroi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mischievous Fantasy Creatures","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4612439,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Eleni Chandriotou","original_name":"Eleni Chandriotou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6600599e0c1255014b0b04a1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4629231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hambis Tsangaris","original_name":"Hambis Tsangaris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ba8b65aadc401636365a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1943,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wqHuPZlGppxUn3DII899iz7bS2u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3455}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1931,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/laGXS4MuSwOUidrN5IZEdyT19rJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1287}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":941,"name":"tradition"},{"id":193536,"name":"cyprus"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":297442,"name":"animation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kalikangiaroi - A Heartland of Legends story","key":"FjBZfd3Muwc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2021-09-30T06:24:21.000Z","id":"6600562877070001630a52eb"}]}}}
