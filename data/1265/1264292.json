Born a dwarf with severe physical disabilities, Margaret’s embarrassed parents locked her away, and eventually abandoned her. She was taken in by the town’s poor after nuns at a local convent rejected her. But Margaret refused to be bitter. As a Third Order Dominican, she started a school for children and dedicated her life to helping the sick and dying. Margaret of Castello was declared a saint in 2021.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cGzgAA8D5fTCROcUwKgIGWiHxfr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life of St. Margaret of Castello","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zw3YtTAMf0wndbKIU1tbj0C6cHS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cGzgAA8D5fTCROcUwKgIGWiHxfr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
