He needs someone to teach him and, coincidentally Luca, whom he despises, is the only man who has managed to make his stonehearted mother Claudia fall in love. Bruno will be forced to put aside any contrast and follow the advice of his worst enemy. What Bruno doesn’t know is that Luca and his mother live a very fragile, undermined, not at all exemplary relationship.","popularity":0.1711,"poster_path":"/xw2Oz1tFeSWLVY0mZPJIrDzb9bb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122242,"logo_path":"/3CGrs7hva4Jxv4FDmfDoYrvOSkH.png","name":"Bronx
