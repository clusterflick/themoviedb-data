He recently started having nightmares and his friends believe it's from watching too many horror movies. One day while watching another cheap slasher flick, Dan's friends walk in and catch him. He blows off their nagging and concerns and takes a nap while they play some video games. Shortly after falling asleep, there's a strange knock at the door. The startled friends decide to investigate the source of the noise and find out what's there. What will they find? Is it real or all just a dream?","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/6YOYS7c0kox2dG8CDZ7UB7siscT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream Reapers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4615925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brady Calhoun","original_name":"Brady Calhoun","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dean","credit_id":"6602d1d90c125501650dff35","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2744730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matty Calhoun","original_name":"Matty Calhoun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Matt","credit_id":"6602d20b60620a017c2f3a32","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4615848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Clark","original_name":"Jeremy Clark","popularity":0.1333,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jeremy","credit_id":"6602d22160620a01492775ac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4615933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Replogle","original_name":"Dan Replogle","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dan","credit_id":"6602d22e62f335017d54b89d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4615848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Clark","original_name":"Jeremy Clark","popularity":0.1333,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602d2521b1f3c017c9d6746","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2744730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matty Calhoun","original_name":"Matty Calhoun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602d267197de401861cb54e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2744730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matty Calhoun","original_name":"Matty Calhoun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602d2441b1f3c017c9d673a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4615848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Clark","original_name":"Jeremy Clark","popularity":0.1333,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602d276d38b58017d1b3029","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6851176","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6YOYS7c0kox2dG8CDZ7UB7siscT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
