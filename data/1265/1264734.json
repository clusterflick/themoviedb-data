For around 70 years, 800 rolls of nitrate film sat in sealed barrels in the basement of a shop in Blackburn. Miraculously rediscovered by Nigel Garth Gregory and later restored by the BFI, this now ranks as one of the most exciting film discoveries of recent times.  Mitchell & Kenyon in Ireland is a unique and vivid record of Ireland at the start of the twentieth century.  The collection contains 26 films made in Ireland between May 1901 and December 1902. Much of this material was unseen for over 100 years. The films include street scenes of Dublin, Wexford and Belfast; the Cork International Exhibition, scenic routes from Cork to Blarney Castle and more. They are accompanied by piano and fiddle music and commentary read by Fiona Shaw.","popularity":0.5278,"poster_path":"/fsuco3pnxCrtI76P15o7BXHYc3f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mitchell and Kenyon","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"XI","name":"Northern Ireland"}],"release_date":"2007-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A unique and vivid record of Ireland at the start of the 20th century, lost for around 70 years","title":"Mitchell And Kenyon In Ireland","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fiona Shaw","original_name":"Fiona Shaw","popularity":1.6644,"profile_path":"/imZ9Ad2RIPmxHZjeflF9po4WVfO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"660244f33520e80165d7c1ff","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2639954,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vanessa Toulmin","original_name":"Vanessa Toulmin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66024598b84cdd0164f5e2c3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sagar Mitchell","original_name":"Sagar Mitchell","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660245da0c1255017e11901d","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Kenyon","original_name":"James Kenyon","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602461c04733f017defec1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3873289,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Neil Brand","original_name":"Neil Brand","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66024759b84cdd017df6f3c2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885053,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Günter A.
