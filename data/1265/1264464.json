It is full of inversions - a sun (sign) that absorbs as well as emits, a mythologized but recognizable world full of unsettling and dreamlike solar imagery and a strobing city at night illuminated by dark light. HelioTrope is a metabolic sci-fi/horror that works on the senses. Inspired by recurring themes of haunted media in popular film and television, the work is self-reflexive of its own tropic nature and is grounded in histories of telecommunications technology and paranormal phenomena.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HelioTrope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4614225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joshua Roberts","original_name":"Joshua Roberts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66019dd77f6c8d017c73b0cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
