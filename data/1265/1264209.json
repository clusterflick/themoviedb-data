In addressing the camera mechanism itself as a subject, and even offering to exchange positions with it, this performance dismembered at one stroke most of the aporias of the materialist/structuralist position in film theory. On the other hand, this work revealed no point of access to the visual image; its situationist grounding in a particular structure of events, which placed voice and performance at stage center, simultaneously won me over to the video medium and stripped me of visual tools (until Combat Status Go).\"","popularity":0.0842,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Concord Ultimatum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Conrad","original_name":"Tony Conrad","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/5m5qwalSYvfG2i26w88UTwMFztK.jpg","credit_id":"6600b54360620a017c2ce843","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
