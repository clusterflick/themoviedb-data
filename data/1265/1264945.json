She and her husband, (Jalal Al Ahamd) have been regarded as \"Iranian Simone de Beauvoir, and Jean-Paul Sartre\". But they had a very different fate. Simin's life is a mirror of what has happened to Iranian women throughout a century, from unveiling the hijab and playing important roles in society to imposing hijab and staying at home in the Islamic regime. This film looks at her life through the history of women's movement in Iran.","popularity":0.0573,"poster_path":"/e4sXe4GV0YmvYAUvqriR8H6wBx1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128909,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBC
