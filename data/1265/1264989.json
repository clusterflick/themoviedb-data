Maybe a ’voice’ will gather all this ruin and bring it together. The Hatay Academy Symphony Orchestra has set out for this. One rail of this ’high-speed train’, which is heading towards disaster faster and faster, is the ’state of emergency’ and the other rail is ’debris’. To change today, we all need to pull the emergency brake, we need to stop this train. Artists from Hatay are in solidarity for this journey. A year has passed and they have turned our pain into something bearable. Without them, this pain would be insupportable.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":"/l8y5mr7t6Ag0mIgbHmJau2DyubJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Singing
