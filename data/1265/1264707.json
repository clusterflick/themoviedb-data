It all begins with her determination to marry a no-good, two-timing, dog of a man. It has yet to be determined if this was an accomplishment. He made her so depressed that she ate a herd cattle and two turkey farms. She lost the weight. She lost her husband and her mind.  She then seduces her nerdy psychiatrist, transforms him into a superfine bachelor and reclaims her life. The way she does it, from beginning to end (and all between), is non-stop, belly-aching hilarious!","popularity":0.1154,"poster_path":"/38cSltxEHld2iu4lai4VrxvPfXn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Young Man, Older Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1214153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Millie Jackson","original_name":"Millie Jackson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Millie","credit_id":"66022c3a3520e8017eda3a7f","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1779,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/38cSltxEHld2iu4lai4VrxvPfXn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1250}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
