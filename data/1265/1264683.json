Nothing of a hagiographic portrait giving a fixed image of the man and his work, the film explores the fragile, precious material of the architect’s sensibility with rare spontaneity, shedding light on how his perception of the emotion of space is\r nurtured.  Conceived as a performative cinematic experience, this film captures the alchemy of a day-long encounter between Bijoy Jain and Bêka & Lemoine – twelve hours of intense wandering, plunging us into the vital energy of the streets of Mumbai. Visual notes made in the intimacy of the studio, observations of informal tactics of the city and visits to production sites, the film reveals how closely Bijoy Jain’s work is tied to the city of Mumbai, providing endless resources and inspiration. A sensory film where gesture becomes the language of intuition.","popularity":0.0996,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":88537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bêka & Partners","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2023-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sense of Tuning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4615051,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nena Aru","original_name":"Nena Aru","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66021be3226c56017d7317fb","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Lemoine","original_name":"Louise Lemoine","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66021b5cb84cdd017df6c44e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2959580,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Melo Prino","original_name":"Melo Prino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66021baf0929f6017e9e2b0b","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209590,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ila Bêka","original_name":"Ila Bêka","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66021b4a60620a017c2e6d21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209591,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Lemoine","original_name":"Louise Lemoine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66021b9f0929f6017e9e2afd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209590,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ila Bêka","original_name":"Ila Bêka","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66021b900c1255017e115aac","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2773686,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Walter Amati","original_name":"Walter Amati","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66021bc104733f0164eb2f3c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4615046,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ila Bêka","original_name":"Ila Bêka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66021b780c1255017e115a88","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
