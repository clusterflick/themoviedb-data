Levi was born in Istanbul in 1960 and moved to Switzerland when she was 6. To her, this city has come to mean her childhood and the homeland of her parents. Especially in the last decade Levi proved prolific with her institutional exhibitions in France, Germany and Italy, and she was particularly praised for her exceptional public art projects in Switzerland. All throughout her oeuvre, Levi has come to emphasise her city of birth and her Sephardic heritage. One of the rare leading woman figures in abstract expressionism, she is also known for her way of naming each and every one of her works after a woman’s name.","popularity":0.0914,"poster_path":"/kpFOE4ERadEEMuXQfkGtD5UrRQk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Name and A Place","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Can Eskinazi","original_name":"Can Eskinazi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602f527d38b5801641a3b1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Can Eskinazi","original_name":"Can Eskinazi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602f53bb84cdd017df77f2d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Can Eskinazi","original_name":"Can Eskinazi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602f5310c125501650e0f36","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2685222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Selin Bonfil","original_name":"Selin Bonfil","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602f5520929f6017e9ed498","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4616224,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Doğa Öktem","original_name":"Doğa Öktem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602f58f3520e8017edae435","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3455491,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Janiv Oron","original_name":"Janiv Oron","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602f576459ad6014af8313d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4616223,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tankut Aykut","original_name":"Tankut Aykut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6602f586197de401861cd834","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4707041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mert Kaya","original_name":"Mert Kaya","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67728e36bf10ff198461ea5f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32389371","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kpFOE4ERadEEMuXQfkGtD5UrRQk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ObT8e8ABZXKU42P9HsQSjgE2mA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":538}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"43.
