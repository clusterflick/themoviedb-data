The conductor gave access to his private life only a little circle of strictly loyal people who kept their secrets even long after the maestro’s death. This documentary for the first time shows in the whole dimension the real man Karajan: not only the image of a dandy that he himself had shown to the public, but the unfiltered image of his personality. Newly discovered original film footage from the inner circle shows Karajan’s private life like it really was.","popularity":0.1436,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26290,"logo_path":"/o7QeTO6M5CLKZP7RYuIxoHbTqET.png","name":"Unitel","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2008-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A revealing look behind the formidable image of the world famous conductor","title":"Inside Karajan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert von Karajan","original_name":"Herbert von Karajan","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":"/x5BINmghy56Hibqxpq9SVkPZouQ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6601d83f7f6c8d0163701ddc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2753548,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jutta Kittner","original_name":"Jutta Kittner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6601d76a459ad60187fb2ebd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jürgen Meier-Beer","original_name":"Jürgen Meier-Beer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6601d74160620a017c2e3d3c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240530,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Heinzl","original_name":"Michael Heinzl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6601d7581b1f3c017c9c5413","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725432,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Otto Schwarz","original_name":"Otto Schwarz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6601d67f04733f017def7ae7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019242,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christian Wesely","original_name":"Christian Wesely","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6601d7b07f6c8d01496d97e8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725432,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Otto Schwarz","original_name":"Otto Schwarz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6601d702d38b58017d1a5e90","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
