Weaving together historical fiction with moments of magical realism, The Underground Railroad is a full sensory immersion into the world of Cora (Thuso Mbedu), who, fleeing slavery, embarks on a treacherous quest for freedom—and is menaced by violence, supported by a clandestine community fighting for liberation, and haunted by the people she loses along the way. With images of searing power and stirring poetry, Jenkins delivers an epic saga of survival and resilience that pushes the limited-series format to new heights of cinematic transcendence.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/5LepCHcCD4KNNIr4ciG9oNa8hfv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20580,"logo_path":"/oRR9EXVoKP9szDkVKlze5HVJS7g.png","name":"Amazon Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":585,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Underground Railroad","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6704972","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5LepCHcCD4KNNIr4ciG9oNa8hfv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Blu-ray (4 Discs, Rated TV-MA)","release_date":"2024-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
