Simon is a hustler caught in the underbelly of queer culture. Late one night Simon slips on the ice that throws him into the arms of Evan, the host of a cable show who suffers from Tourette's Syndrome. After a night of unbridled sex, Simon realizes that Evan's ticks have subsided. He believes that he is meant to save Evan from his afflictions, leading them to unabashedly dive into a sado-masochistic relationship. Simon basks in a world where sadness and depression have become his new turn on and where his emotional destruction is the only true way to give Evan his soul.","popularity":0.22,"poster_path":"/31e3Yv4BhzRsTABW5b7CfOSvXRm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into It","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradley Baloff","original_name":"Bradley Baloff","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6024bfba149565004074aced","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2392176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richardson Cisneros-Jones","original_name":"Richardson Cisneros-Jones","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Rem","credit_id":"6597cb3560c51d56ae9789ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Conaway","original_name":"Matt Conaway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6024bfc9c0ae36003d59f79b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Conaway","original_name":"Sarah Conaway","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6024bfced6c30000406b5a41","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aly Fletcher","original_name":"Aly Fletcher","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6024bfd59979d20040e825cf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zach Welsheimer","original_name":"Zach Welsheimer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6024bfe28b959e003c1fe4c2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Zinn","original_name":"John Zinn","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6024bfe86a3448003d125d10","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Maccubbin","original_name":"Jeffrey Maccubbin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a925a470e0a265c4e00512d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Maccubbin","original_name":"Jeffrey Maccubbin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6024bfaf6af8f8003e2d2d3c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Maccubbin","original_name":"Jeffrey Maccubbin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6024bf98bc2cb3003da534ce","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Maccubbin","original_name":"Jeffrey Maccubbin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6024bfa9f36a32003fb193f2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Maccubbin","original_name":"Jeffrey Maccubbin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6024bf9fef9d7200415916ed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Maccubbin","original_name":"Jeffrey Maccubbin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6024bfa4764b99003f1f19bb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1542670","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vlNUqn3qL1kKy6bGcfbdF6EOdlT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wjGNmpmQ04w2DuOJ4uRBCEwVD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/31e3Yv4BhzRsTABW5b7CfOSvXRm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2348,"name":"hustler"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
