Like in Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale \"The Loveliest Rose in the World\" where a prince must search for a rose to save his mother, who is dying in bed, \"Tied Hands\" sees a reversal of roles as a desperate mother goes out to find marijuana, to ease her son's pain. In her, turbulent journey in the streets of Tel-Aviv, old truths from her past come back to life and threaten to break down a wall of denials behind which, she's been hiding all her life.","popularity":0.1571,"poster_path":"/cUyf2DEFJEr0qBQut6UYQXp069R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tied Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gila Almagor","original_name":"Gila Almagor","popularity":0.1894,"profile_path":"/w5X2yS6tgVVbYUwRjFenWeN25I3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"636c2e966611b4009b18aa4a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2754716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ido Tadmor","original_name":"Ido Tadmor","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/iGBEmTaKOzy1GZ23lLGfFuMII11.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"636c2e9c963864009b9f8761","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelly Tagar","original_name":"Nelly Tagar","popularity":0.1622,"profile_path":"/vMtH6zTEByajXE1KnizlXBurBhF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"636c2ea26611b4009b18aa4f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Stark","original_name":"Sharon Stark","popularity":0.0677,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"636c2ea9ffd44d007fd2ed58","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomer Sharon","original_name":"Tomer Sharon","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"636c2eaf0499f2007feacfc3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1164977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uli Sternberg","original_name":"Uli Sternberg","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"636c2eb51684f700ab7fa8c2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Leon","original_name":"Mickey Leon","popularity":0.1666,"profile_path":"/ctWyq71xAGmKlI4BuOApFb09mfs.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"636c2ebd81383100dd3563e8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Mayer","original_name":"Ray Mayer","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"636c2ec2963864007de0dae0","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Wolman","original_name":"דן וולמן","popularity":0.1484,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9281030e0a2616d201b7d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0833548","wikidata_id":"Q4411254","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cUyf2DEFJEr0qBQut6UYQXp069R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
