More!","overview":"Laughing Matters...More! is a reality-based romp that blends the routines from four of lesbian stand-up comics with personal interviews. It features Elvira Kurt, a Second City alum named Canadian Female Comic of the Year and writer for Ellen DeGeneres; Sabrina Matthews, a regularly featured performer on Comedy Central; Renee Hicks, the first African- American woman nominated Best Female Stand-up at the American Comedy Awards; and the Southern-Baptist-lesbian-mom-turned-crossover-comic, Vickie Shaw. This film takes a \"reality\" approach to showcasing the comics, capturing their on-stage performances, and their personas off-stage in behind-the-scenes footage, one-on-one interviews and recurring segments where all four converge for spontaneous and improvised discourse.","popularity":0.0773,"poster_path":"/kMsmro9nOkfG0ihuFvECBqNUCuE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laughing Matters...
