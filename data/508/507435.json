The interview deals with the traumatic experiences of war and the difficulties of returning to civilian life—both through what is recounted, and in the gaps of what can never be said. The imprecise and fragmentary animation style incorporates drawn and stop motion animation shot on a very small “macro” scale (16 mm X 9 mm).","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/b4TSlpCogVU77DT6WauRPkYXZeJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Things I Can't","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1985030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Auden Lincoln-Vogel","original_name":"Auden Lincoln-Vogel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a92c7829251410b0300ade5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b4TSlpCogVU77DT6WauRPkYXZeJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
