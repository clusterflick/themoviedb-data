Jack meets the familiar figure of the butcher who bargains with him for the cow and finally Jack consents to part with the animal for the wonderful beans which will grow up overnight until they reach the sky. He takes them to his mother, and, of course, she is heart-broken and throws the beans out of the window. The next morning the vine not only covers the window, but reaches far above the top of the house out of sight in the clouds, and we see Jack start to climb upward. Upon arriving at the giant's castle Jack meets the ogre's wife, who towers majestically above him, and after some parley is invited in, on his plea of hunger. Before he can be served the giant is heard and Jack is hidden in the kettle. The giant comes on and then follows the familiar scenes in which the ogre calls for his bags of gold, his magic harp and the wonderful hen that lays the golden eggs.","popularity":0.0537,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jack and the Beanstalk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Hulette","original_name":"Gladys Hulette","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/uvsTd2w1s52CRePbptkMzBBNsm3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jack","credit_id":"5a9109e20e0a2616cf005574","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Nesbitt","original_name":"Miriam Nesbitt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/yXzMNXHYQaNVf96UI0cidc6wwVc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jack's Mother","credit_id":"5a9109f1c3a3682529005c11","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry B.
