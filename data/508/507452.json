In swift sequence the giant galaxies, tiny microscopic organisms, cultures and civilizations of the heroic past are summoned to bear testimony to the Glory of God and the spiritual nature of man. Then the story narrows down to one solitary individual, Jesus Christ, the Carpenter of Nazareth, and the effect of this Man upon the world. The film closes on a highly personal note as Mr. Graham invites viewers to receive Christ as Savior and Lord.","popularity":0.442,"poster_path":"/pyBrSUZaidP5yzfgpL0ioEGCKt4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18760,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Wide Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1964-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man in the 5th Dimension","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"World's Fair Encounter","type":"Reissue title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":214918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Graham","original_name":"Billy Graham","popularity":0.1952,"profile_path":"/sgloCXfR9zsOEpM7rC9lAycGXpB.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a92e5380e0a2616d2021719","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dick Ross","original_name":"Dick Ross","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616c928bba131b0029a29bde","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56463,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ralph Carmichael","original_name":"Ralph Carmichael","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a92e5e50e0a2616cc0230a4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dick Ross","original_name":"Dick Ross","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a92e59a0e0a2616bd0208de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dick Ross","original_name":"Dick Ross","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a92e5a30e0a2616bd0208ef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41186,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ralph Woolsey","original_name":"Ralph Woolsey","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a92e5ad9251414174020a25","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1985114,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Irving Berlin","original_name":"Irving Berlin","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a92e5c3c3a368250b01eedf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1985116,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Russell Busby","original_name":"Russell Busby","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a92e5fd9251414174020a73","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1985115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dorothy Yutzi","original_name":"Dorothy Yutzi","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a92e5f0c3a368250b01ef0e","department":"Directing","job":"Continuity"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2218103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralph Axness","original_name":"Ralph Axness","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5a4b560e0a261dee631375","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0348674","wikidata_id":"Q6746357","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pyBrSUZaidP5yzfgpL0ioEGCKt4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2nVr4OCe8iOopMYXkSfcf1CIe8Z.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9882,"name":"space"},{"id":206315,"name":"christanity"},{"id":211431,"name":"mortality"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"opening date of Worlds Fair in New York City.","release_date":"1964-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Official Release","release_date":"2015-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
