It returns us to a bleak caravan park somewhere on the Isle of Sheppey and finds Uncle David has introduced a new addition to his community, whose warped imagination and love of horror might have led to murder. Some of the park's inhabitants take a keen interest in the androgynous Michael/Michelle. A pair of emotionally disturbed siblings are especially curious and needy around this new arrival. Drawn into Uncle David's web, their presence has consequences for all concerned. Certainly not for the faint of heart, this is bold and adventurous filmmaking and as queer as it is unsettling.","popularity":0.0839,"poster_path":"/4qNE1SGIryDR8bzScZWlY6eAwBU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147659,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avant Garde Alliance","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncle David 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1647462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hoyle","original_name":"David Hoyle","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/fyswC7BAKB50qQMiLcft0iWo6yN.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60070dbd498bc2003ddb0079","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2943325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matty McCabe","original_name":"Matty McCabe","popularity":0.1377,"profile_path":"/ohwcbeqedKl5lvXSGsyi2BA3uiq.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"60070dc5bc2cb3003c6d2a30","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2943327,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucy McCormick","original_name":"Lucy McCormick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"60070dcb223e20003dc0828e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Archie Redford","original_name":"Archie Redford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"60070dd1df2945003cf5a9c6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1647463,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Reich","original_name":"Gary Reich","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da7fe58a2423200147a88d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1647463,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Reich","original_name":"Gary Reich","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60070d7d420228003ff4d334","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1647462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hoyle","original_name":"David Hoyle","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/fyswC7BAKB50qQMiLcft0iWo6yN.jpg","credit_id":"60070d86edeb43003d480595","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1647462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hoyle","original_name":"David Hoyle","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/fyswC7BAKB50qQMiLcft0iWo6yN.jpg","credit_id":"60070d8fdf2945003ef5a74e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2943325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matty McCabe","original_name":"Matty McCabe","popularity":0.1377,"profile_path":"/ohwcbeqedKl5lvXSGsyi2BA3uiq.jpg","credit_id":"60070d9a51f99a003d6cce70","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2943327,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucy McCormick","original_name":"Lucy McCormick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60070da9223e20003dc08246","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Archie Redford","original_name":"Archie Redford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60070db34ca676003d0c6000","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9105886","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6VdAGAvA6pwrE69ogOCF2ST17p1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4qNE1SGIryDR8bzScZWlY6eAwBU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x6Ulo3HrSodDrLFwn1z1YA3CQNz.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BFI Flare","release_date":"2018-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
