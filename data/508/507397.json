After 13 years traversing the Saturn system, the spacecraft Cassini is plunging to a fiery death, becoming part of the very planet it has been exploring. As it embarks on its final assignment - a one-way trip into the heart of Saturn - Horizon celebrates the incredible achievements and discoveries of a mission that has changed the way we see the solar system.  Strange new worlds with gigantic ice geysers, hidden underground oceans that could harbour life and a brand new moon coalescing in Saturn's magnificent rings. As the world says goodbye to the great explorer Cassini, Horizon will be there for with a ringside seat for its final moments.","popularity":0.0773,"poster_path":"/ud9gzHrRLcdcQ07Xq3C68DwtlRZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goodbye Cassini - Hello Saturn","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7506682","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ud9gzHrRLcdcQ07Xq3C68DwtlRZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pktJ9nrJktsCyhd2GB8xmivN8Sb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1432,"name":"nasa"},{"id":9882,"name":"space"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
