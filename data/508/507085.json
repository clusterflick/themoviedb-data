Was he a practical revolutionary or a naive idealist? On the practical side, he was the mastermind behind the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, and was totally ruthless during the ensuing Civil War. As an idealist, he was committed to the pursuit of international revolution, but created many political enemies. After Lenin's death, Trotsky lost in a power struggle with Stalin, and later was expelled from the Communist Party. Trotsky was exiled from the Soviet Union, eventually finding refuge in Mexico. In 1940, Stalin ordered his assassination, and Trotsky died after being struck in the head with an ice-pick. History records that Trotsky was a master theoretician, a skillful propagandist and a brilliant orator.","popularity":0.2569,"poster_path":"/i3KcOK5CYLrPcmZaWgsJH8gkmg7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phil Sheppard Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leon Trotsky: A Personality in the 20th Century","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983829,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Phil Sheppard","original_name":"Phil Sheppard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a90895a0e0a26096c003ef6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i3KcOK5CYLrPcmZaWgsJH8gkmg7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1773,"name":"socialism"},{"id":2111,"name":"soviet union"},{"id":173644,"name":"communism"},{"id":180827,"name":"bolshevik"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
