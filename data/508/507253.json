A small town nestled in the shadow of a gigantic factory. Ben, a shy eleven year old boy, lives there alone with his mom when she leaves him to strike. The coming of the troubling Eva in his bunch disturbs him a little bit more, especially when she mentions the legend of a mysterious creature hidden under a nearby lake's pontoon. As a game, Eva challenges Ben: walk through the \"pontoon of the death\", and come back. But Ben fails miserably. At night, the Creature appears to him.","popularity":0.0999,"poster_path":"/fi0NP9ONrMOJSm0LZeVVYky5imi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68259,"logo_path":"/ee93JRKJqv77qpZoCnR7JWJGKse.png","name":"oriGine Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Love Eva Marsh","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Te Amo, Eva Marsh","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","title":"Te Amo, Eva Marsh","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1984556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaouen Gouevic","original_name":"Jaouen Gouevic","popularity":0.0651,"profile_path":"/tB31bPFPE6bkNrlgrrr072jk7tk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ben","credit_id":"5a91bbf6c3a368250200f963","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1984558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elyne Craipeau","original_name":"Elyne Craipeau","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Eva","credit_id":"5a91bc00c3a36824f600f40e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1984560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morwenna Spagnol","original_name":"Morwenna Spagnol","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/lRXoVhrG6WlMb9UnefLKjW2oJpT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ben's Mother / The Creature","credit_id":"5a91bc23c3a368250b00ee78","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devi Couzigou","original_name":"Devi Couzigou","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Nicolas","credit_id":"5a91bc32925141417700f6a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1735166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anouchka Csernakova","original_name":"Anouchka Csernakova","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/zt0bXGRIfOLwP7gDUORSQc5MSgX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Grandmother (voice)","credit_id":"5a91bc47925141417a00f0a9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1984563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Martin","original_name":"Joseph Martin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/89ItmcMus39m0cirCaJMATeGMI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Victor","credit_id":"5a91bc5c925141417a00f0c3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rémy Rondeau","original_name":"Rémy Rondeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a91adb8c3a368250200e78f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rémy Rondeau","original_name":"Rémy Rondeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a91bbd80e0a2616c601032c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1984553,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Myriam Dupuis","original_name":"Myriam Dupuis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a91bbe2925141418600ef63","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7005694","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hVEtLraLyUkphemZcKcMXNYGmHA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dhzJItYnd66q52HSj1yEZb1VPLq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1188,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fi0NP9ONrMOJSm0LZeVVYky5imi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Festival du Film de l'Ouest","release_date":"2017-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"J'aime Eva Marsh /I Love Eva Marsh (2017) Teaser Trailer, French Short Film.","key":"zVMEZbUDuNs","published_at":"2018-02-24T19:48:14.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5a91c1b20e0a2616c0010d74"}]}}}
