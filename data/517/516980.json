In this documentary feature from Phil Harder, we follow the now 95-year-old Milgrom through his life and living legacy.  From his first introduction to film, via Charlie Chaplin’s The Kid, to a tour through his personal home “film museum,” A Work in Progress is an inspiring portrait of one of Minnesota’s leading artistic voices. Milgrom himself discusses his journey as a filmmaker and his current projects, including his continued work on the 1959 documentary Russian Journey: The Story of a Filmmaker’s Travels Behind the Curtain","popularity":0.0741,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Al Milgrom's Cinematic Journey","title":"A Work in Progress","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Milgrom","original_name":"Al Milgrom","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5aca32ad9251413711001a29","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Harder","original_name":"Philip Harder","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aca32e10e0a26497105b107","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
