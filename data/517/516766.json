The film follows Pennie through her daily life for a period of one year and is structured in a way that every scene reveals a new facet of the character. In doing that, the film challenges preconceived notions and ideas regarding femininity, sexuality and sex work. Pennie is queerness in its essence. She is able to fluidly move through gender roles, stereotypes and sexuality in the most natural way, even when being part of an industry that moves strongly in the opposite direction.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3wRshCsff0sjADddSupQshMqDhE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pennie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lola Clavo","original_name":"Lola Clavo","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8ee030e0a26497a04640e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3wRshCsff0sjADddSupQshMqDhE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
