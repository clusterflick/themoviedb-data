These remarkable structures nurture new life, protecting it from the outside world at the same time as allowing it to breathe. They are strong enough to withstand the full weight of an incubating parent and weak enough to allow a chick to break free.  But how is an egg made? Why are they the shape they are? And perhaps most importantly, why lay an egg at all? Piece by piece, from creation to hatching, David reveals the wonder behind these miracles of nature.","popularity":0.8952,"poster_path":"/w2OyyQ5SotIKP6PpVIgkUl7LisW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mike Birkhead Associates","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Attenborough's Wonder of Eggs","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Attenborough","original_name":"David Attenborough","popularity":1.4236,"profile_path":"/tt3LW3XftcvxOZtMXmIaJSWFN7y.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"5ac51caac3a3682d9a053023","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2925083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bethan Jones","original_name":"Bethan Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff5011ee78687004040f7e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":220951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Birkhead","original_name":"Mike Birkhead","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff5014508cf870041b322af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oKvWNeG6PHje2ODBIO9w4KFryD3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w2OyyQ5SotIKP6PpVIgkUl7LisW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e3WFexF8kjxPb1Ox5LWZAOFIhKJ.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"},{"id":271311,"name":"egg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
