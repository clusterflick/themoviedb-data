About 10,000 Zanskaris live in the isolated valley. In winter, mountain passes are blocked, the summer Jeep road closes and buses stop. Two decades ago, three friends founded a ski school - to enable winter travel in the valley, improve quality of life, and to encourage young people to stay in Zanskar by helping establish a culture of mountain sports. The film tells the story of this friendship, the ski school and the development of skiing in the area. Along the way a bigger question is raised. Most recently, the federal government announced a major road building project that will provide year round access to Zanskar. How can Zanskar's wilderness be preserved? It is only a matter of time before the winter road is completed, and the \"Big India\" rushes in.","popularity":0.2394,"poster_path":"/mxx8dt6py0sM0s28RCPzMdo2etF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Putorana Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2018-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shangku Shelter","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2018793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Stephenson","original_name":"Ben Stephenson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aca2eb90e0a26497a05e49b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vera Neverkevich","original_name":"Vera Neverkevich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aca2edec3a36834d0058ffa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yana Kehrlein","original_name":"Yana Kehrlein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aca2efec3a36834d0059025","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2796584,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vera Neverkevich Hill","original_name":"Vera Neverkevich Hill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f734830223e2000377dc83a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2796585,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Stephenson","original_name":"Ben Stephenson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f73483ffea0d70033ff24fc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5635128","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l9mCQeRYBBUVzBP4uyEioFSSvBP.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/mxx8dt6py0sM0s28RCPzMdo2etF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":527}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1442,"name":"winter"},{"id":9935,"name":"travel"},{"id":194451,"name":"social issues"},{"id":195732,"name":"ski"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Silk Road International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shangku Shelter - Trailer","key":"154548021","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-02-08T04:04:47.000Z","id":"5f7347c7d40d4c003863b1db"}]}}}
