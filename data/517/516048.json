But a girl has offered her services to the manager, and as she is willing to accept a smaller wage he engages her instead and tells the man that he can go. The clerk resolves to go to the girl and ask her to give up her place, but she refuses. She discovers he has left his umbrella behind, and finds him just moving, away with his two little children. The girl's heart is touched, and she leads them into the house and warms them at the fire, and writes a letter to the manager, saying she wishes to give up her place, and begging him to take back her predecessor.","popularity":0.1871,"poster_path":"/xMfTGsq66e8JSpGDH2w89qUl7yt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1911-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Daily Bread","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Duval","original_name":"Henri Duval","popularity":0.0964,"profile_path":"/jMO3Ux9RvmPszf7xmOZX0L5ULXp.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"-","credit_id":"5ac4bfb4c3a3682db504cc80","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Feuillade","original_name":"Louis Feuillade","popularity":0.7649,"profile_path":"/6pwcFyr5UI6RHYdIfO91za66tJX.jpg","credit_id":"5ac4bfcb0e0a260c01048a11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0988889","wikidata_id":"Q3225151","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xMfTGsq66e8JSpGDH2w89qUl7yt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1911-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
