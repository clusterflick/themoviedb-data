A confrontation at the New Year’s Eve Ball at the Paris Opera leads to the princess being wrongly suspected of attempted assassination against the pasha. With the help of an English diplomat, she manages to flee Paris, but the pasha and his henchmen are hot on her heels. This marks the start of an extended, action-driven cat-and-mouse game that stretches to the outer regions of the Bosporus – and back again.","popularity":0.112,"poster_path":"/5I99BCnnmzZOZ4BFiHwM5qckaT9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1923-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":209,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Woman Worth Millions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1930321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Richter","original_name":"Ellen Richter","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/A5A4nGJD67uR4Y3eBeZpooeAKqG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Smaragada Naburian","credit_id":"5ac6a813c3a36834db0176e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Alexander","original_name":"Georg Alexander","popularity":0.0914,"profile_path":"/uhNaGN0dnzMitrXtJSX9eOi7x5S.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anatole Pigeard","credit_id":"5ac6a82392514162b701660a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduard von Winterstein","original_name":"Eduard von Winterstein","popularity":0.1866,"profile_path":"/fIH6N0IG136FiuJ9ztoI2SYQ4fk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mahmud Dedim Pascha","credit_id":"5ac6a831c3a36834e201884b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Pointner","original_name":"Anton Pointner","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/4ncxQv9mDrssdOUZtLyJyKqOCCY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Stuart Hardington","credit_id":"5ac6a84c0e0a264967018f55","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Picha","original_name":"Hermann Picha","popularity":0.1504,"profile_path":"/rHNFH1lDVQOVioEHNTLhfGPYi0X.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gospodar von Valona","credit_id":"5ac6a85b92514162b7016692","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":253297,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Merzbach","original_name":"Paul Merzbach","popularity":0.1422,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b8149dff66e0062352572","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willi Wolff","original_name":"Willi Wolff","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b81510c1255008d35e175","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willi Wolff","original_name":"Willi Wolff","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac6a7fec3a36834de016e2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0439184","wikidata_id":"Q21870010","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":2778,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5I99BCnnmzZOZ4BFiHwM5qckaT9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1858}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1923-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
