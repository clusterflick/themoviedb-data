He had a dozen friends join him for different sections of the trip, and one friend who joined him for the whole thing: his blue heeler, 10-year-old Genghis Khan. They covered more than 400 miles on their journey, and Ace wore one pair of shoes for the entire trip: Vasque Inhalers. Filmmakers Forest Woodward and Brendan Leonard captured the trip, and Genghis and Ace's special relationship, in the short film \"Ace and the Desert Dog.\"","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/cHU7VLgtsZ3W5cTPcxVNyy3z67f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ace and the Desert Dog","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cHU7VLgtsZ3W5cTPcxVNyy3z67f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
