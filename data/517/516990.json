Years later, news arrives that the estranged mother of her ex-boyfriend (Chad) has suffered a similar fate. Michelle's friends convince her to return home to support Chad, and finally face the fears that have been haunting her for years. The group heads to Crowing Lakes for the weekend, unaware that the unexplained disappearance is not an isolated incident. A local DNR officer befriends the group, while desperately trying to solve the odd occurrences to prevent more locals from moving away in a struggle to keep the resort town afloat. All seems to be going better than expected, until things take a deadly turn and their friends begin to disappear, one by one. Their frantic search for a reasonable explanation brings them face-to-face with the horrifying secret that Crowing Lakes has kept for more than half a century.","popularity":0.5668,"poster_path":"/uKgQ8EHB1H8yH1XJbfHu403MVLv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11517,"logo_path":"/7tT0PqNjEalEwE1GkjxU32SlOW6.png","name":"Buffalo Gal
