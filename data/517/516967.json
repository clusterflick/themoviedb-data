Driven by the possibility of showing up with an old flame and impressing his old army buddies, he sets out to attend his 65th WWII reunion in California with his directionless and unreasonably self-confident granddaughter, Ashley. Each with their own issues and agendas, they head west in a dilapidated Winnebago. Encountering oddball tourist attractions and eccentric characters, they find themselves in seemingly impossible situations with only each other for support. As the journey progresses so does their relationship and they begin to understand and appreciate each other as individuals while discovering that being young and being old, aren't all that different.","popularity":0.8615,"poster_path":"/xew7uIBuFKBDrSgSMGVPWzAlrzI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farmer of the Year","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Corbin","original_name":"Barry Corbin","popularity":1.677,"profile_path":"/vcHtLrUmfyT1KiuBqmLdXA3luPJ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Hap","credit_id":"5aca2afdc3a36834d7063b87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1623255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mackinlee Waddell","original_name":"Mackinlee Waddell","popularity":0.1945,"profile_path":"/uc6ywv7wbxiQuARRsFkih1rPNnL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ashley","credit_id":"5aca2b1bc3a3687a4f024168","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Kiser","original_name":"Terry Kiser","popularity":0.5741,"profile_path":"/8xkfhO2APIV1rP4Byy0TcBhQ5qH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Virgil","credit_id":"5aca2b35c3a36834de05678e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Courteau","original_name":"Aaron Courteau","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/lIt2PG4rLb7hQNwk5inufIZ2EOX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Aaron","credit_id":"5f151b0978570e00325be949","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Sidney","original_name":"Douglas Sidney","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/xEWAbYhZEAYKVoXomnaUh2AH5DC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Interviewer","credit_id":"5f151b1478570e00345ecdf5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathy Swanson","original_name":"Kathy Swanson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aca2b840e0a26497705e07b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vince O'Connell","original_name":"Vince O'Connell","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aca2b65c3a36834e205db99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5943466","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1554,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xew7uIBuFKBDrSgSMGVPWzAlrzI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1038}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
