Returning to the U.S., he produced this alarming-yet-hopeful film, replete with its lonely, Tanguy-inspired landscapes peopled with static figures casting long shadows across charcoal-colored plains. While taking the risk of leaning a bit toward didacticism, Stapp managed to urgently convey the thought that world destruction was not necessarily inevitable, provided that people embrace, rather than reject their cultural and racial differences. ‘Picture’ is a unique document resulting from the sometimes dreamy, sometimes nightmarish vision of the artist in a war-torn land, with the spectre of death hovering ever-so-slightly ahead.","popularity":0.0743,"poster_path":"/uQfYA3Ai2ZtruKaOu3buhYMWXfR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1948-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Picture in Your Mind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Abel","original_name":"Walter Abel","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/fmRDR3Rtz6mmbAKuhsQHjFi4cRN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ac648c692514162b4010c34","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Stapp","original_name":"Philip Stapp","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac6489f92514162a400f911","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Stapp","original_name":"Philip Stapp","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac648ae92514162b100fac1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7259294","wikidata_id":"Q123289182","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.639,"height":939,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uQfYA3Ai2ZtruKaOu3buhYMWXfR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
