Five years prior to making the film, Mikkelson met Mary Johnson and O’Shea Israel, a meeting she describes as a life-changing event that would lead to the development of Risking Light. It was then she learned that Johnson had chosen to forgive Israel for the murder of her son, which motivates the tone of humanistic mission in the film.","popularity":0.4131,"poster_path":"/wxunLgn7MQK2U2Sn3REandtOgxv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105042,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emergence
