The nights of twelve dreamers – sometimes recounted in front of the camera, sometimes with a voice-over that accompanies shots of office buildings or urban worksites – reveal how the capitalist system invades the modern-day psyche. Long shots of edifices with smooth surfaces and sheer edges instil a deceptive gentleness. Zombies, corpses, mummies, ghosts, skulls sliced open like an egg and emptied by spoonfuls… The images follow one after the other, no two alike, but the editing organises a gradation towards the vampirism and an insidious passage from night to day, from dreams to real working life.","popularity":0.167,"poster_path":"/4Un85XwVZtZU0eYci6BrhjV8Kwq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51881,"logo_path":null,"name":"alteregofilms","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2018-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreaming Under Capitalism","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1165748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Bruneau","original_name":"Sophie Bruneau","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8eb090e0a26496e04692d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018687,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Philippe Boucq","original_name":"Philippe Boucq","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc3237bc3a3682d53040213","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1532785,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Valène Leroy","original_name":"Valène Leroy","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc324860e0a266e68044dcd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":76266,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aline Gavroy","original_name":"Aline Gavroy","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc324b10e0a266e57047d5e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1368092,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Johan Legraie","original_name":"Johan Legraie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3967a74ca676001755d359","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":71494,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hichame Alaouié","original_name":"Hichame Alaouié","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6000117d7d5db5003dcb2d92","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149892,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Maxime Fuhrer","original_name":"Maxime Fuhrer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6000118e90cf51003c4ef663","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1740211,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pierre Choqueux","original_name":"Pierre Choqueux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600011a37390c0003df549f8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8775580","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":864,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/iLqomZvD1GFWR8svR4dDhuA7acn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vB3Mbaohmwarxo67MkfV4kKhfTA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jNQU7M13bQCWAmXBL61nhMosZ1E.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4Un85XwVZtZU0eYci6BrhjV8Kwq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinema du Réel festival","release_date":"2018-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rêver sous le capitalisme - Trailer VO FR / ST EN","key":"260086093","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2018-03-14T16:38:08.000Z","id":"5ca2cdfac3a3682b161036d8"}]}}}
