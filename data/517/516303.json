A thorough interpretation of the period as a reference note to world-famous French philosopher and sociologist Jean Baudrillard’s notion of ‘simulation’. The film’s title is an ironic extension of Sigmund Freud’s famous quote, \"America is a mistake, admittedly a gigantic mistake\", which implies the Austrian scientist’s disappointment from empty American life in which money is the utmost value.","popularity":0.0882,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":243886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Front Film Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BULGARIA IS A BIG MISTAKE TOO","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5042050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stoyan Radev","original_name":"Stoyan Radev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729ed9850e15e8f5a581672","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5042051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Georgi Lozanov","original_name":"Georgi Lozanov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729ee1f42bec49877804085","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6349,"name":"bulgaria"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
