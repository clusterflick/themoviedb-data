In Ken Russell's modern interpretation presented by the Genoese Opera, it has Faust as an ageing hippy. He smokes marijuana and is tormented by his lost youth. Mephisto makes a bet with God that he can turn anyone to pagan life, even someone as innocent as Faust. From then on it is a battle of good against evil in a flamboyant, surreal display of primary colours, PVC costumes, nurses with swastikas, rocket trips, love and even characters dressed as Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse. Ken Russell said because the devil is always with us is his reason for the contemporary setting.","popularity":0.1091,"poster_path":"/sDGNSVLIzhUptT7nEHx85ZvfSQb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ken Russell's modern interpretation of Arrigo Boito's Il Mefestefele","title":"Il Mefistofele","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paata Burchuladze","original_name":"Paata Burchuladze","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/AkuLoBieYUZKZNxELe4fe9NQtYU.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5ac8b2550e0a26496e0421a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2017916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ottavio Garaventa","original_name":"Ottavio Garaventa","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ac8b25dc3a36834d7044eff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2017917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Morelli","original_name":"Adriana Morelli","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ac8b265c3a36834e8043528","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Russell","original_name":"Ken Russell","popularity":0.3562,"profile_path":"/hM5kaWhCsdZbl2NsHES3rWzt8xa.jpg","credit_id":"5ac8b27492514162b703b0c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arrigo Boito","original_name":"Arrigo Boito","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8b28292514162ae03f16a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2017918,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edoardo Müller","original_name":"Edoardo Müller","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8b2940e0a264965041d67","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2017919,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paul Dufficey","original_name":"Paul Dufficey","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8b2aec3a36834e2041a26","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2017920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlo Nistri","original_name":"Carlo Nistri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8b2c20e0a26497a041960","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2017921,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Richard Caceres","original_name":"Richard Caceres","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8b2cc92514162b403eb2a","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arrigo Boito","original_name":"Arrigo Boito","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8b2dec3a36834de03bfe6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0097859","wikidata_id":"Q123288050","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f5ICk86sJVsCzQQ2Y5RbRReu5Xt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sDGNSVLIzhUptT7nEHx85ZvfSQb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
