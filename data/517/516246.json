The audience experienced the live performance via Sennheiser wireless headphones surrounded by the uninterrupted life of the station.  Based on Italo Calvino’s beloved novel, Sharon's production of Christopher Cerrone's Invisible Cities immersed audiences in an unpredictable platform of everyday life, creating an “invisible” production that made each audience member the protagonist of the experience. With performers appearing and disappearing into the everyday fabric of the building, Sharon and choreographer Danielle Agami drew the audience into an uncannily intimate proximity to LA Dance Project and the singing ensemble.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invisible Cities","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2014-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"INVISIBLE CITIES Official Trailer","key":"VFeaSdGb2zc","published_at":"2014-04-24T05:31:41.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5ac5a4570e0a264967005311"}]}}}
