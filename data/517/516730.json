Using exclusively shot footage, this programme charts the rise and rise of one of the best loved cars ever made.  Key models have been specially filmed to bring to life the history of this remarkable car from the earliest Mark 1s through to the last versions that saw a revival of interest in the car in the last years of the 20th century. The programme also illustrates just how adaptable the Mini is from mild tuning to full blown customising including a 4 x 4 version with enormous ballon tyres.  This programme includes an interview with Dr Alex Moulton, suspension designer and one of the last surviving members of the small team that created the Mini. We also look at the Mini's remarkable competition heritage both on the track and in rallying. Renowned Mini racer and tuner, Richard Longman whose racing exploits did much to revive interest in the Mini during the late 1970s.","popularity":0.3578,"poster_path":"/fhEzK8I8t5HzEMkKddigOuJblWH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174977,"logo_path":null,"name":"Green Umbrella Ltd.","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Mini legend is set to continue well into the 21st century.","title":"Story of the Mini","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2017966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Moulton","original_name":"Alex Moulton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ac8be5c0e0a264965042b2e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2017967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Longman","original_name":"Richard Longman","popularity":0.0581,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ac8be6c0e0a264974040ce3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2017971,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Exell","original_name":"Tim Exell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8bed90e0a26497104009f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2017970,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jules Gammond","original_name":"Jules Gammond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8bebbc3a36834d7045eb6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2017942,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bruce Vigar","original_name":"Bruce Vigar","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac8b87c0e0a26497103f8e6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1068,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fhEzK8I8t5HzEMkKddigOuJblWH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":759}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":240555,"name":"classic cars"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"ASIN: B00009QNUK","release_date":"2003-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
