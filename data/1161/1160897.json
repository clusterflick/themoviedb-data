The iconic 35 and a half km body of water separating Britain and mainland Europe. It’s the busiest shipping lane in the world; prone to dangerous swells and treacherous weather conditions.  You can sail it, fly over it, and even catch a train under it, but only a handful of hardy souls have attempted to pedal across! The Guinness World Record stands at 6 hours and 39 minutes and endurance cyclist Jon Shubert and triathlete Mark Threlfall have it firmly in their sights.  Their training schedules are in place and a crack team of engineers at Oxford Brookes University has built them a kayak/tandem craft that they hope could just be a record breaker. Can pedal power conquer The English Channel’s mighty waves?","popularity":0.088,"poster_path":"/7STxhXlm8cwt0Rt6NXKhDZSoYZw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Channel Crossing","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eSzaUaEMdIEPmji5H4ALsmmSUb1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7STxhXlm8cwt0Rt6NXKhDZSoYZw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vBwEoeQkOFG0Br7pnAufTze8Dup.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":180491,"name":"cycling"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Channel Crossing","key":"31vE4FbKna0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-02-06T14:32:55.000Z","id":"64ce266785090f0125bc3717"}]}}}
