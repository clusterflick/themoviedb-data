Some musicians talk about love or hope, Han Dae Soo’s music roots in pain. His songs are about freedom even in the most oppressive circumstances. He prepares to release his last album in 2020. A master’s recording session is full of improvisation and energy. As a man of over 70 years old, his voice has gotten deeper and stronger with age. His is a husband and a father and a human dwelling upon the possibility of death approaching. As a youngster he exerted sharp criticism towards society, but on his last album it leans more towards reflection and regret rather than anger. Han Dae Soo tells us his last story strolling through the streets of Manhattan and Namdaemun. The aged hippie’s laughter still resonates with joy.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2023-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dae Soo: Life Is Just a Laugh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4197140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Han Dae-soo","original_name":"Han Dae-soo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64cd22f3764b99013af744bb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4197138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seo Hyun-ho","original_name":"Seo Hyun-ho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cd22d3706e56010b0b748c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EBS International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2023-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
