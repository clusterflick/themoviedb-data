Objects that appear on film include details of a religious fresco, Jean Arps’ ‘Lion of the Cyclades: Seated’ (1957), metallic sculptures and glass prisms. Some sections are filmed within the exhibition ‘Light as a Creative Medium’, which was curated by Gyorgy Kepes at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard University in 1965, organised in conjunction with MIT. Interspersed throughout are some of Eidlitz’s light experiments, playing with light, colour and movement. The soundtrack is similarly experimental, consisting of fragments of music, radio voices and electronic noise.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/sIMjv17iXwV8FJ8ztWpXnsNY33B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ekta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4198697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Eidlitz","original_name":"Frank Eidlitz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iWsT0d7a9cidKR1WBzYl5WlqSKH.jpg","credit_id":"64ce59f1303c85013a14b7c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sIMjv17iXwV8FJ8ztWpXnsNY33B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
