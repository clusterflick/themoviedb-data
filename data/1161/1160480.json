Only a dozen remain today. For ten years, the cinema industry was a pillar of the Cuban Revolution, but the regime’s hardening and the economic recession precipitated its decline. Fifty years later, only a dozen movie theaters are still running in Havana, while a new generation of bold filmmakers struggles for the very existence of Cuban cinema.  In the Heat of the Cold Years tells the story of Revolutionary Cuban cinema through the memories of a choral of elder filmmakers, such as Luciano Castillo, the director of the national film archives, as he scrambles for the preservation of this crumbling cultural legacy, and through a group of young Cuban filmmakers struggling to make their first feature film.","popularity":0.2016,"poster_path":"/2UBgfwf4GKXKl4APXrhhze82YR8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Heat of the Cold Years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":72644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirta Ibarra","original_name":"Mirta Ibarra","popularity":0.2415,"profile_path":"/83arb64FeBPkRGBSbuHMcNLuTgk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd17d4764b99011df5ef66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrique Pineda Barnet","original_name":"Enrique Pineda Barnet","popularity":0.0504,"profile_path":"/k6nEIUVR8DC9nf3V9blMo5NG2Po.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd17da43cd5400e27d2747","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Manet","original_name":"Eduardo Manet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd17f5798e06013a068eca","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adela Legrá","original_name":"Adela Legrá","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/8bFzhlniRPJyVqwgCS9fjeGRjkL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd17fc706e5600eaa7668b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668137,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jerónimo Labrada","original_name":"Jerónimo Labrada","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd1806798e0600ad1860af","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4197050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darius Kaufmann","original_name":"Darius Kaufmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cd17a82f266b09ef124fff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4197051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eytan Jan","original_name":"Eytan Jan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cd17b1798e06013a068ea3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11575652","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2UBgfwf4GKXKl4APXrhhze82YR8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
