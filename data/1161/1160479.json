There, through an unlikely acquaintance, she discovers the medieval legend of the Merman. The truth behind this seemingly innocent myth is darker than Mari could imagine. Merman explores themes of prejudice and isolation against the breath-taking backdrop of the Suffolk coastal landscape. Mari finds herself questioning whether humanity will ever be accepting of outsiders or are they destined to suffer as the Merman did hundreds of years ago.","popularity":0.3267,"poster_path":"/394zwdgNz0LtGdNNvsP2GrvWlPK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Davis","original_name":"Phil Davis","popularity":0.9716,"profile_path":"/sNJ9nFWxpGVmQYvq7rU9xqryu0F.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd1786764b9900ae129761","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alistair Petrie","original_name":"Alistair Petrie","popularity":0.4377,"profile_path":"/byHbMDmqhh0C0yGSOgvx978PiCI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd17a7706e56014ec4c6da","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleanor Grace","original_name":"Eleanor Grace","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd17b643cd5400c5274efa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1224725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Scott","original_name":"Lucy Scott","popularity":0.103,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd17c6e04d8a3aab1a095a","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/394zwdgNz0LtGdNNvsP2GrvWlPK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
