This occurs on two occasions; the summer of 1973 and the winter of 1974. The camera runs at either 24 fps or 12 fps The film is assembled according to pre-determined factors; (i) the 12 frame / half second bias as observed in Sheepman section; (ii) a double binary - alternating apparent movement away from and toward the surface of the screen, (a function relying on the perception of successive frames); (iii) combinations of one or other of these. The primary function of the 12 frame opaque film is, as in the Sheepman section, not so much as markers of time but as a constant factor comparative to those frames they surround.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/payMZJLt5Mp95c7v031xPxBNhzt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film Lane","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Leggett","original_name":"Mike Leggett","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/3xwSF4AQ5diilxFwowCvPnfDcOT.jpg","credit_id":"64ce4621d9f4a603b49ff931","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/payMZJLt5Mp95c7v031xPxBNhzt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
