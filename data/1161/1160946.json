Filmed in Kentucky, Missouri, and England, ANIMALICOUS features a bomb-diving duck, a squirrel which thinks it’s landed on Normandy Beach, a hawk that could easily work for a hair growth pharmaceutical company, a parakeet, a turkey, a hungry snake, and one tiny little dog. It’s a funny but wry account of how animals can be a way of defining ourselves. In ANIMALICIOUS Lewis displays a genuine knack for uncovering the comic and quizzical relationships that exist between people and creatures great and small.","popularity":0.1065,"poster_path":"/hsvUSlIqJyGXS3GpWR3LZiipWcs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animalicious","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Lewis","original_name":"Mark Lewis","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":"/8TWe0m49h32aYk5symCm7mOQ2tw.jpg","credit_id":"64e66a17c613ce012cc41fb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0176449","wikidata_id":"Q4765008","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hsvUSlIqJyGXS3GpWR3LZiipWcs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
