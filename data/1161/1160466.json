A mixture of folk horror and satire, the plot presents an alien vampire who, traveling through the galaxy, lands in his grave in Santiago, Chile. Its subtitle of \"Escenita Criolla\" reflects the character of its modest production and nods to socio-cultural elements of the country. After the coup d'état, the 16 mm copy was buried in the courtyard of the house of one of the actors, and was later finished by Castellano in 1990 in the United States.","popularity":0.0509,"poster_path":"/v4KV6McgB4P0vcO84Uqa3ztzrkv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"1973-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nosferatu, a Creole Scene","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricio Saavedra","original_name":"Patricio Saavedra","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd10e52f266b09ed6048c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4197015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hernán Castellano","original_name":"Hernán Castellano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd10f4798e0600ad185d6c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4197017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Roncallo","original_name":"Antonio Roncallo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd113743cd5400add65cc6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4197018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanca Sagrista","original_name":"Blanca Sagrista","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd117b798e0601000e97a1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4197019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Demetrio Psijas","original_name":"Demetrio Psijas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd11862f266b09ec5f0e59","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4197020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Ángel Bienzobas","original_name":"Miguel Ángel Bienzobas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd1190764b99011df5ec7e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4197021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Lucero","original_name":"Antonio Lucero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64cd119843cd5400e27d2479","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4197022,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jorge Navarrete","original_name":"Jorge Navarrete","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cd11cb706e56010b0b6d5d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4197015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hernán Castellano","original_name":"Hernán Castellano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cd11d743cd540139cdf781","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4197015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hernán Castellano","original_name":"Hernán Castellano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cd11de706e5600c9a13c85","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v4KV6McgB4P0vcO84Uqa3ztzrkv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":809}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
