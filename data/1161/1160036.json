With scissors as his chief implement, Matisse introduced a radically new operation that came to be called a cut-out. Matisse would cut painted sheets into forms of varying shapes and sizes which he then arranged into lively compositions, striking for their play with color and contrast, their exploitation of decorative strategies, and their economy of means. Matisse called his process “painting with scissors” and he developed the act of “carving into color” with innovative expertise.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE CUT OUTS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4195455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Chandler","original_name":"Scott Chandler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cbd663297338020e579bc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
