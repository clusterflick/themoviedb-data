Shaun is not a sheep who follows the rest of the flock, and his lively personality sets him apart from his fellow herbivores. Inquisitive, imaginative and mischievous, his independent nature can lead him into tricky situations - although he usually proves quick-witted enough to come out on top. He is good-natured and popular with the rest of the flock. Although unsure about some of Shaun's madcap ideas, they can be cajoled into joining in with his latest scheme.","popularity":0.0624,"poster_path":"/anhk5IWuQPXvQVYlRXlXcqPFeW7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":297,"logo_path":"/58TnhYZqbMYgkHM6lg7dJoYJ4RH.png","name":"Aardman","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"8 Baa...rilliant Adventures!","title":"Shaun The Sheep: Shape Up With Shaun","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/anhk5IWuQPXvQVYlRXlXcqPFeW7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
