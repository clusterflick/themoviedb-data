In her film, Akerman provides a picture of life on both sides of the border, emphasising the fact that it is not possible for the viewer to decide on the basis of the picture which country was being talked about. Fenz takes the same element of a physical border separating two worlds to a more abstract level, in which the sharp line adopts a series of different forms.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crossings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Fenz","original_name":"Robert Fenz","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ccf940e04d8a3aa8b431d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
