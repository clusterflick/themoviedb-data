They're all getting ready for Christmas, but also learn about Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. Bear also celebrates his favorite tradition, the finding of the winter berry. As things start out, Pip and Pop have put together a reindeer wreath. Everyone wants to help out with the wreath, so Bear suggests they all add something of their own. Later, the group meets Santa Hogg and presents him with a large list of holiday wishes. Then there's a bit of an argument when Treelo wants to open everyone's presents and not just his own. In the Shadow segment, Shadow thanks Bear for his gift of a scarf --- Shadows don't get cold, but it's the thought that counts. She then sings the song \"It's Kwanzaa Time.\" After hearing a howling noise, the group takes in an old hound named Jack with no home and invites him to stay at the Big Blue House for the holidays. This gets everyone thinking about the true meaning of the holidays.","popularity":0.8995,"poster_path":"/wHkQ8gQF541sAnLsa7xpTuJYMzw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77036,"logo_path":"/aXYJIaFS2P0B2aujG2US1DPwugO.png","name":"Jim Henson Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bear in the Big Blue House: A Berry Bear Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Urso na Casa Azul: Um Natal Muito Feliz","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel MacNeal","original_name":"Noel MacNeal","popularity":0.3038,"profile_path":"/ndTYKKf9HpwRjVVOSX3XS1xej55.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bear","credit_id":"64cc70d243cd5400add61487","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":360193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Linz","original_name":"Peter Linz","popularity":0.2754,"profile_path":"/hQZzWLqAK1sf45ddLCMh6Yuiaai.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tutter / Pip","credit_id":"64cc70f7e04d8a01008f3667","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2121861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicki Kenderes-Eibner","original_name":"Vicki Kenderes-Eibner","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ojo / Lois / Grandma Flutter","credit_id":"64cc711ce1faed011e387a74","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyler Bunch","original_name":"Tyler Bunch","popularity":0.2078,"profile_path":"/h9uxOioFww3lcf2ttG8IqF0m765.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pop / Treelo / Doc Hogg","credit_id":"64cc712e43cd5400ff9b269a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2683319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tara Mooney","original_name":"Tara Mooney","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Shadow (voice)","credit_id":"64cc714043cd540139cdae8c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynne Thigpen","original_name":"Lynne Thigpen","popularity":0.4581,"profile_path":"/wCMTGuJk6kxEmElNT56HpsL3GJO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Luna (voice)","credit_id":"64cc7167e1faed013b3ce629","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Goelz","original_name":"Dave Goelz","popularity":0.4597,"profile_path":"/tBJDwH008IVSeTCB5e2P856NbIv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jack the Dog","credit_id":"64cc718543cd5400add614f9","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5QcqOdAgZOdWCBrvQbdaoCD0p75.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LeVUSuDqiuKxeWYTs8Dvtglfc8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aVyy5w1B5YXFEuXgyUKBJNMyBKN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wHkQ8gQF541sAnLsa7xpTuJYMzw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1349,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nIp1o5LyWCccCJnMHN5KPJwPuFd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1349,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/wRVq5HB52FhTuPYNaZAk8ZlBjtt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
