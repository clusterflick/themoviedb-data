Tae-bong is working as a straw in a smuggling office. Incompetent detective Nam-hyuk is using him to replace the sorrow of not having a string to pull. While doing his duty in the smuggling gang, an incident exposed Tae-bong’s identity. Without knowing his situation, Nam-hyuk is trying to steal the smuggled goods to turn his life around. But he is dragged into a mysterious crime as he enters another office by accident. At the brink of death, Tae-bong gets through the crisis by chance but loses all the money he has saved after being involved in the incident with Nam-hyuk… A cooperation begins between a detective and an informant, for Nam-hyuk to break the case and for Tae-bong to get his money back!","popularity":0.2734,"poster_path":"/juoiUFhfhAN2p6fCtQl2KbOPPxf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66404,"logo_path":"/aVGd9Vd0XQ4wcaTz7DSsrJK5Ncs.png","name":"IOK Company","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Informant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heo Sung-tae","original_name":"허성태","popularity":0.3503,"profile_path":"/j65kOkZ8RjGVuwNHjuIVbSD49tB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Oh Nam-hyuk","credit_id":"64ce5789549dda00e2dcd911","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Bok-rae","original_name":"조복래","popularity":0.2849,"profile_path":"/aTzFktB9Z1BcxjUxd33cQROLQnO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jo Tae-bong","credit_id":"64ce578e4d679100e24021be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2101538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cha Soon-bae","original_name":"차순배","popularity":0.2683,"profile_path":"/7oDDNlBZRUb9M7VxM5X1p1eXw4c.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hwang Sang-gil","credit_id":"64f689538e20c50cd50b9b2b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1530559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jang Hyuk-jin","original_name":"장혁진","popularity":0.2978,"profile_path":"/gBI4xgvtCBLTLz25jA6JgB0xccd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kang Young-gu","credit_id":"64f6895bb234b90100963857","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2617504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Min-joo","original_name":"Kim Min-joo","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/q8GFgPUihi7MohMl1Ok3eM7bXbV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lee So-yeong","credit_id":"66458fc7fbddf970f1eed24b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4254106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Seok","original_name":"Kim Seok","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f689d0ac4161013eb8789e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4254106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Seok","original_name":"Kim Seok","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f689a4e0ca7f00cbe6d4b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":2850,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/juoiUFhfhAN2p6fCtQl2KbOPPxf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
