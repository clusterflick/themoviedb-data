Sirota) is a sweeping romantic musical about the human need for love and companionship, based on Mary Shelley’s classic novel.  Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein was first published in 1818, and this work honors that source material as a contemporary work of musical theatre.  Having lost his mother at a young age, Victor Frankenstein seeks to end human mortality and arrogantly enters territory beyond his control. While he enjoys unconditional love from Elizabeth, he grants none to his creation.  The Off-Broadway production of Sirota’s FRANKENSTEIN opened in 2017 and ran for nearly 3 years in the NYC theatre district at St. Luke’s Theatre, where it achieved acclaim. That production was re-staged especially for film in what is an exciting new hybrid between a recorded version of a stage performance and a movie musical.","popularity":0.1774,"poster_path":"/tkBydNoekDwN38pzJQHTR6FAbHq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A sweeping romantic musical about the human need for love and companionship.
