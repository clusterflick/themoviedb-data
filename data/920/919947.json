It started in 1977 and ran for 300 issues and holds the Guinness World Record for \"Most consecutive issues of a comic-book drawn and written by one person\". The comic's creator, Dave Sim, told us there was a 99% chance he would not approve of our film, but against all odds upon finishing the film he gave a thumbs upon completion. Our film is the first CGI feature to be done on no budget in history. He has previously turned down George Lucas, DreamWorks and Paramount.","popularity":0.9689,"poster_path":"/1LA6FM0okwg4sK8l210pZZE7hr7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166827,"logo_path":null,"name":"What ?
