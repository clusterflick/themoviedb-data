Maria finds out that her husband Jan is in the hospital but it turns out that the man does not recognize her. Maria has doubts about whether Jan has actually lost his memory, or is lying to avoid punishment for potential desertion. The many understatements and secrets cause confusion. Night mixes with day, for both the audience, and our heroes. Is any of this real? Maybe it’s all a dream, maybe a figment of a traumatized mind.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the night comes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3252752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katarzyna Sikorska","original_name":"Katarzyna Sikorska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c7bdd166a0d30064373d97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15084806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
