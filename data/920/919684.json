It's time for him to go to work and he goes out of town with a gun behind his back, to a small forester's hut. During the day he cares for peace and order in these wild lands, listens to the whispers of the river, wanders through the thickets of the forest, puts his face in the sun - One night his attention is drawn to the moan of a wolf trapped. Her husband saves her, she thanks him for his service. But suddenly human laws begin to conflict with the laws of nature.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/kCs0jImicoxyUjzMdISrG5jGF9w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"2015-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water Supply","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Водозабір","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3357524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ada Kviraia","original_name":"Ada Kviraia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c61c1437b3a9008fc19924","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16604562","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kCs0jImicoxyUjzMdISrG5jGF9w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"informal year release date","release_date":"1987-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Molodist Kyiv International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
