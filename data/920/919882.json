The film narrates in cinematographic form the problem of the third sex, its justification and its existence within a real environment that is society itself. Two parallel worlds are shown to us; one, the hard and professional life of some artists who try to put on a 'music-hall' show. The other world is independent but it shows us what the life of an old glory was like, of an old man who was an artist in his time. Comparing one era with another is the intention of the film and ultimately its plot.","popularity":0.0867,"poster_path":"/uWjD1QSSy9X6xeZ6R9FDsMxCa1q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Third Door","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Álvaro Forqué","original_name":"Álvaro Forqué","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c75b8b48333a004294dbfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0075321","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":788,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/uWjD1QSSy9X6xeZ6R9FDsMxCa1q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":569}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
