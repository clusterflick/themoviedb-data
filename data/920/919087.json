During the making of the record and the subsequent live shows the band had amalgamated a significant amount of footage that needed to find a home.  Working closely with Danny Bowes, we shot a series of master interviews that provided the narrative for an hour long documentary that features on the January 2016 earMusic release \"All You Can Eat\".  Taking the supplied live footage, band-shot studio footage and other archive material we used the band's own words to stitch everything together and to describe what was, due to guitarist Ben Matthew's diagnosis of throat cancer, a worrying and uncertain time.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Thunder - 'The Wonder Days' Documentary A compelling mix of interview, concert and archive film","title":"INDEX Thunder - 'The Wonder Days' Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
