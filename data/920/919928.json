About fifty, balding, paunchy, Robert spends most of his time locked in the garage where he tries to develop a teleport machine.  Robert will try to teleport himself, but a fly is stuck in the machine, and the scientific apprentice will gradually turn into a giant insect. Robert will little by little dehumanize to become a beast able to climb the wall, pushed by an insatiable search for food.","popularity":0.2583,"poster_path":"/gYAlb17aa8B1txOaAI4Y0c0uPHb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166820,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wahoo
