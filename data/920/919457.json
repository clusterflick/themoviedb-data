Located on Haight Street, the halfway house provided survival services and a supportive environment for GLBT people with nowhere else to go. Through interviews with residents and staff and images that capture both the melancholy liminality of its domestic spaces and the comforting intimacy enjoyed by its residents, Pavlow creates a portrait of a unique place that attracted a diverse group of people during the summer of 1977.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7L3MN18E2LcVASjEPakvdYlo2LZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Survival House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3356858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Pavlow","original_name":"Bruce Pavlow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c538fb48333a004291e1a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0259007","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7L3MN18E2LcVASjEPakvdYlo2LZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
