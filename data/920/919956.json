This know-how has always stood him in good stead. Upon retirement, Golay became a full-time toy maker. Even as a watchmaker, he used to make toys for his own children.  The film follows his steps as he builds a toy hand-cart, from raw wood to finished product. We also see his collection of toys, which are reduced-scale models of all the carts, wheel barrows and other implements used on the farm before the invention of the tractor.","popularity":0.0572,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1992-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arnold Golay, Toy-maker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":939576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline Veuve","original_name":"Jacqueline Veuve","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/2Gt2pyXRGywy5ktcpFoj9Fnmei4.jpg","credit_id":"61c7a5e763a6950019dc600e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
