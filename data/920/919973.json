The night of its initial hearing at the grand opera house the members of the colony turn out en masse. Too poor for orchestra seats, they gather in the gallery around the old composer. The old composer is happy almost to tears, and when the last note has died away there is a cry for the composer. Felix attempts to utter a few words of thanks, but is smothered with flowers. At his studio his friends have prepared for his welcome, and it is upon his arrival there that be feels the happiness which comes of success. However, at the other end of the hall another different drama is being enacted. A girl sits beside her stricken mother, and as the merriment in the studio reaches its height, the soul of the mother departs from the body.","popularity":0.336,"poster_path":"/xwdrplMBnVHDGOUuyPfgUkAmiRN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Discord and Harmony","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murdock MacQuarrie","original_name":"Murdock MacQuarrie","popularity":0.1092,"profile_path":"/xjXY0di1hFXfnErsfAwkOgBSCjd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Old Felix - the Composer","credit_id":"61c7b4210102c90065abb88b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1156970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Bush","original_name":"Pauline Bush","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/xvnLUGdgalYCKhtngNfxdK6VbLr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Girl","credit_id":"61c7b42e48333a001c33006f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Forrest","original_name":"Allan Forrest","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/jhGHhMlLlprXT3VBQuvVHFw9Ht1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Artist","credit_id":"61c7b43e37b3a9004dacb2b4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Neill","original_name":"James Neill","popularity":0.1679,"profile_path":"/8UdbRiw5JExib3szIYEOdVtuPW6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Symphony Conductor","credit_id":"61c7b450ecaef5001c3a1bc1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lon Chaney","original_name":"Lon Chaney","popularity":0.3652,"profile_path":"/m1icBooBEqFNp24Puu7qXn2Sarr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lon - the Sculptor","credit_id":"61c7b45dc15f89001c0244e6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan Dwan","original_name":"Allan Dwan","popularity":0.2253,"profile_path":"/kAvLKEkjOpOzQSEpvFrjF0b5Nq9.jpg","credit_id":"61c7b40737b3a9004dacb237","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Rosson","original_name":"Arthur Rosson","popularity":0.1973,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c7b41048333a001c330022","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003837","wikidata_id":"Q3030151","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uqurLuAj6Uza2STx88B1Eeri13C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1275,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xwdrplMBnVHDGOUuyPfgUkAmiRN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
