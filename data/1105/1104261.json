Police cars were overturned and burned, windows were shattered, stores were looted, and waves of young people were caught up in the mayhem. From directors Asia Youngman and Kathleen Jayme, “I’m Just Here For The Riot” chronicles the aftermath of the event captured on hundreds of cell phone cameras, with the rioters outed, shamed, and their lives altered forever. From the mob mentality in the streets to similar vengeance in the online hunting of those responsible, it was a dark moment in the city’s history – one that raised deeper questions about fandom, violence, and the shocking power of an angry crowd.","popularity":0.1057,"poster_path":"/3lzKHmcoKmO8N7IcscnYV2znqma.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm Just Here for the Riot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2114392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathleen S.
