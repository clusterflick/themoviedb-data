After revealing the recent death of her mother, she convinces him to take her to scatter the ashes, offering him Â£200 for his time. After noticing a flyer for a music competition in Aberdeen, Doug spots an opportunity to make some money and agrees, relaying that the ashes be scattered in Cruden Bay, just outside of Aberdeen. As the two travel north to Scotland, Aubrey battles with her illness and Doug's stubborn behaviour, but the pair gradually find themselves becoming closer. This unravels when Aubrey finds the competition flyer, revealing the true reason for being in Aberdeenshire. A fierce argument breaks out and Aubrey storms down to the beach to scatter her mothers ashes alone. Doug follows her and stands looking on as the ashes are poured into the sea.","popularity":0.1942,"poster_path":"/Ad3e7V7WoTeoc7p56IoLPyOUnO3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"16 year old Aubrey tracks down her estranged father and travels north to scatter her mothers ashes whilst battling with her constantly declining health.","title":"Near Wild Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3708180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gareth George","original_name":"Gareth George","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Doug","credit_id":"641eb920c613ce01268ccf0a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3978363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maddie Wakeling","original_name":"Maddie Wakeling","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Aubrey","credit_id":"641eb932d6dbba00d708bdd2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Thorburn","original_name":"Dan Thorburn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rv3uiB9XwsxF2THRAq2PJncHRXC.jpg","credit_id":"641eb88fb234b900db718a5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302936,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dom Old","original_name":"Dom Old","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641eb8a2c613ce00bdcde9a2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302934,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Max Graham","original_name":"Max Graham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641eb8fdd6dbba007cd4548c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302937,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jennifer Muellenbach","original_name":"Jennifer Muellenbach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641eb90ed6dbba01157881a5","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Thorburn","original_name":"Dan Thorburn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rv3uiB9XwsxF2THRAq2PJncHRXC.jpg","credit_id":"641eb8afd6dbba007cd45463","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4lEBDHu6M2CwfBCOgp3FHtYn5sj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ad3e7V7WoTeoc7p56IoLPyOUnO3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":190823,"name":"social realism"},{"id":314814,"name":"m62 presents"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
