Kaden Kane, an opportunistic, smart, young man gets his first taste of the otherside when he gets brought up to the nepotism floor by Flowers Knight, the silver-tongued and morally bankrupt leader of the 66th floor. But as rumors of child labor inside the manufacturing plants continue to gain steam, Kaden and Flowers attempt to halt the discovery of the very real allegation before it leads to the collapse of the entire company. However, when Kaden gets the chance to stop this document from spreading at the cost of his remaining morality, he has to ask himself what he really, really wants; He wants more.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MORE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
