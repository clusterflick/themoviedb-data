He is captured by the posse and as he is dangling from a tree tells the story of how, years before, he and Ben had been in Texas together, Ben fleecing Rube of all his savings, robbed him of his girl, and disappeared. As Rube is about to breathe his last word, a message comes to the effect that Ben has recovered. The posse cut Rube down and take him back. He discovers that the girl is still with Ben and is the mother of seven urchins. Ben tries to rid himself of this domestic burden, but Rube flees on his trick mule and has the last laugh on the gambler.","popularity":0.1154,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vogue Motion Picture Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"He Died and He Didn't","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Turpin","original_name":"Ben Turpin","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/7j5ESXENAgKjVpAezqe29ivrv66.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Gambler","credit_id":"641d5f66344a8e009b0b0fcd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rube Miller","original_name":"Rube Miller","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/j2PQc0AoaFWH5dz6BVxmtOE3lFx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Prospector","credit_id":"641d5f75e1faed007be3e6c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3421051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Hamilton","original_name":"Lillian Hamilton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/hPzmdmwX3vhN1dyezVGLruIkHq2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Girl","credit_id":"641d5f878de0ae0101b8efa4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rube Miller","original_name":"Rube Miller","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/j2PQc0AoaFWH5dz6BVxmtOE3lFx.jpg","credit_id":"641d5f27344a8e00ba3be8b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0470347","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
