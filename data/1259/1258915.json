These youth face a range of challenges, ranging from an unlivable home situation to being thrown out on the street without any compassion after coming out of the closet. The documentary explores who these young people are, the impact this has on their lives and where they end up. 'Verstoten' (Cast Out) tells the story of two young people who share how they ended up on the streets and the challenges they endured. They share personal experiences about their life on the streets, the dangers they face and their experiences with shelters. The threat of alcohol, drugs and prostitution remains constantly present in the lives of these young people. In addition to these young people, the people who offer help to these young people or otherwise stand beside them are also featured, highlighting the complex reality of homeless rainbow youth in the Netherlands.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cY2UCqYQkywzlZCvfeFRTzzmVwn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cast Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332586,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claire Slingerland","original_name":"Claire Slingerland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f298275a7884014ad70ccf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332586,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claire Slingerland","original_name":"Claire Slingerland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f2982006f98401854676c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29925850","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/62OpdQPXHFtNrlC7KQbPCabhh9i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/cY2UCqYQkywzlZCvfeFRTzzmVwn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
