Upon learning of the tragedy, her best friends gather around her and help hide the evidence from the men at the party, as well as distracting Nancy, the detective’s wife. As Barbra tells Nancy stories to distract her, we learn the truth of their marriage, and of her husband’s temperament. As the friends work together to save Barbra, we see the true combined strength of women. But will they get away with their crime? And what on earth will they do with the body?","popularity":0.1216,"poster_path":"/9IgLF8QCPfQ1fXnL7kfwgMBdJny.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radiance Cinema
