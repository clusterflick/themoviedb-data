In the final months of his mother Elaine's late-stage dementia, gay filmmaker Kyle Henry uses his extensive family archive to travel back in time, exploring the complicated bonds of identity, history, and belonging in his large Texas family. Charting Elaine's promising early life through her years of motherhood and self-sacrifice, finally tracing their relationship to its inevitable end, Time Passages explores Kyle's conflicting feelings of love, grief, guilt, and helplessness. Beneath the Kodachrome smiles and grainy Super-8 home movies lie the difficult truths that so many families hide. With their unearthing, Time Passages becomes a memento mori: a testament to love, legacy and the things that carry us through life's most challenging times.","popularity":0.0619,"poster_path":"/ZkRnOHrM89xjTIEug1NHw6F8Se.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An ordinary family.
