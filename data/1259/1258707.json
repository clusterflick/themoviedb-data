Now that the couple have reached the meet-the-family milestone of dating, Mia invites Jeffrey over for dinner with her traditional parents not knowing his race. This makes Jeffery uneasy so he brings gifts to the parents to help his case. Most fathers are very protective over their daughters when another man comes in and tries to \"take her\" away from him. This is seen in Mia's father George's actions and speech throughout the dinner with Jeffrey. Everything changes when George finally opens his gift from Jeffery.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18359,"logo_path":"/kCKM088vKrlqO6ch2ClT6eCCV5j.png","name":"Ringling College of Art +
