Our imagines are components of our spirit, and if our dream reproduces any representation, it is primarily our representations. All dream creation is subjective, and the dream is a theater in which the dreamer is scene, actor, prompter, director, author, audience and reviewer together. All dream figures have personified traits of the dreamer's personality, and when one observes oneself within, one sees moving images.\" (Carl Gustav Jung)","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"the lucid dream of the last poets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eleonora Manca","original_name":"Eleonora Manca","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f176d46dea3a017c79b103","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
