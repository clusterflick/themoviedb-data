As the owner of a struggling snack bar, Harrie and his partner try to sell their meager fries, meatballs, and spring rolls. With few customers, it seems the end is near. But then the clever owner of the adjacent tattoo shop offers a solution. Despite Harrie's doubts, he agrees. When the food inspection service pays a visit, Harrie fears being exposed. But then he makes a shocking discovery!  With his comical and impulsive character, Harrie takes one foolish step after another. Each time, he plunges deeper into hilarious predicaments.
