Hayes adopted her interview style and the name of the series from from the 1963 film, “Comizi d’Amore” (“Love Meetings”), in which the filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini moved across postwar Italy interviewing Italians about sex and sexuality, examining the shifting values of the period. Now, with similar moralistic undercurrents running through American culture, Haye’s video underscores the endurance of chosen community.
