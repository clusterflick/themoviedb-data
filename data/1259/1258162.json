Fearing that he would lose his affection for his daughter, he sets off on a motorcycle trip from São Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul, with the intention of leaving the girl in the care of his ex-wife. Along the way, Geraldo reveals himself to be a violent man as a result of the accident. The girl tries to regain her father's love, but he ends up being guided more and more solely by his paternal sense of responsibility. And what's worse: even this tenuous thread that still connects father and daughter runs the risk of breaking at any moment.‍","popularity":0.104,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":34630,"logo_path":"/lKKe99vus0EbdBoMunQMm8olFVA.png","name":"República Pureza Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Cão de Guarda","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murilo Benício","original_name":"Murilo Benício","popularity":0.7804,"profile_path":"/AsKMI4o2qwXDwFqSFaPKasOZEe8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Geraldo","credit_id":"65f0a62ba579f901867328cc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1381157,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gabriela Amaral Almeida","original_name":"Gabriela Amaral Almeida","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":"/bw3gKIGQn2KEmisDgxzdobUvtTR.jpg","credit_id":"65f0a638a579f901867328e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14568472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
