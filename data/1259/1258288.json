How could it be anything other than by taking risks, and trying out equally radical methods, never straying from to his example. The two filmmakers immerse us into the storage warehouse where, in 2010, all the archives kept by Godard in Switzerland were transferred, and they create a doppelganger (or a duplicate) of the director, who takes up the role of our guide into his world. Excerpts from his writings, his images, his perspective in cinema give us a glimpse into his mythology, his techniques, his singular gaze, and therefore also in his worldview.","popularity":0.1353,"poster_path":"/35HhNu9EzQeAL8TLeBRG3w5cZj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90535,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ardèche Images Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only Godard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Luc Godard","original_name":"Jean-Luc Godard","popularity":1.0955,"profile_path":"/zP5EDY5MstfkdBmPXNCj8Y6v5KR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65f0e0086dea3a016377c40b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4588607,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Julien Perrin","original_name":"Julien Perrin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f0df7b06f9840162420a88","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4588604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Sorrel","original_name":"Vincent Sorrel","popularity":0.1742,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f0df3d0e4fc80186ca31de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1772421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnaud Lambert","original_name":"Arnaud Lambert","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f0df0f06f9840185421bf2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2831360,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benoît Chabert d’Hieres","original_name":"Benoît Chabert d’Hieres","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f0dfcd726fb10186c40eda","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Boutet","original_name":"Antoine Boutet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f0dfbaeea34d014b120fec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4588604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Sorrel","original_name":"Vincent Sorrel","popularity":0.1742,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f0df88d64ac2014b5ced7f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1772420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Marie Barbe","original_name":"Jean-Marie Barbe","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f0dfe0fbe36f0185ed0431","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1708661,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Luc Forveille","original_name":"Luc Forveille","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f0df98470ead017e9b3026","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31546882","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/35HhNu9EzQeAL8TLeBRG3w5cZj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"#TIDF26 | Only Godard","key":"lfdaVZwtqKQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-28T08:53:10.000Z","id":"65f0e0e62fdec601892024f5"}]}}}
