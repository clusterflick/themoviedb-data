German forces surround Hortiatis, unleashing their Greek collaborators, the infamous “Schubert supporters” upon the village’s residents. Before long, 146 people - mostly women and children - are brutally murdered, some of whom were burned alive in the local oven. In this documentary, the only two survivors from the martyr's oven recount those tragic hours of the holocaust.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/aoqswPYr9gmhoHeaVNHOpq0DMau.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223342,"logo_path":null,"name":"TTN Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The holocaust of Hortiatis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4589667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nakis Amanatidis","original_name":"Nakis Amanatidis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narration","credit_id":"65f18fcc6dea3a014978318f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4589669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angeliki Triaridou","original_name":"Angeliki Triaridou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narration","credit_id":"65f18fe399259c01635d240a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4589663,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alain Martin","original_name":"Alain Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f18fa5470ead017e9d2677","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4589660,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kostas Efraimidis","original_name":"Kostas Efraimidis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f18f852fdec6013b202a6f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4589660,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kostas Efraimidis","original_name":"Kostas Efraimidis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f18f75fbe36f0185eef5a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":843,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aoqswPYr9gmhoHeaVNHOpq0DMau.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
