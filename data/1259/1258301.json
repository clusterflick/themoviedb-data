Serene and light-hearted, Gigi has no wrinkles on his face or conscience and with his ironic and good-natured philosophy he passes unscathed through the traps that his relatives set for him so that he can get his head straight. Guelfo, on the other hand, longing for tranquility, marries a beautiful widow with children but will immediately have to deal with a reality very different from the one he was used to.  Dialect comedy by Vittorio Barino and Martha Fraccaroli from 1988, ideal prelude to \"Ol mond l'è pien da sorpres\".","popularity":0.1158,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A sto mond vegn tütt a tai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
