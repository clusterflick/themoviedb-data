It is recognised as one of the most beautiful works of art of the 17th century France. In the beginning it was the site of a modest chateau built by Louis XIII as a hunting lodge. The site was then chosen by Louis XIV for the construction of the palace which stands there to this day, a symbol of royal absolutism and the incarnation of Classical French art.","popularity":0.0339,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":155909,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Bird Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Versailles Gardens and Park","title":"Versailles: The Palace and the Gardens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Vichet","original_name":"Jacques Vichet","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/ocfplwq17QRgslsLJYnpp8HhDBT.jpg","credit_id":"65f0b433d236e601864f1d6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
