I take the F train to 63rd St. Station and walk two and a half blocks to this building where my doctors share, it’s on this route that all this footage was recorded. It was like my way of saying: 'I am not dead yet!' […] At one point someone says 'Can I help you?', it’s a line I got many times, people thinking 'Good god he can’t even hold the camera!' […] It’s going back and forth, it’s a kaleidoscope. I don’t want to see the screen any longer – I mean the two-dimensional plane, I tend to exert it quite frequently in other works. Here I wanted to shatter, totally shatter.\" – Ernie Gehr","popularity":0.0617,"poster_path":"/epeetCc0Rf5UfJQbczPRx2qEbGf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pedestrian Activities","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernie Gehr","original_name":"Ernie Gehr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4H0Vs7M9LOgoXdk6vOfjUD6C7wd.jpg","credit_id":"65f271e799259c01866002ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1395,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/epeetCc0Rf5UfJQbczPRx2qEbGf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":930}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"MoMA","release_date":"2023-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
