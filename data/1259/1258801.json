The film follows Cree co-director Neil Diamond as he asks, “Why do they love us so much?!” and sets out on a journey to find out why the world is so fascinated with the stereotypical imagery of Native people that is all over pop culture.  Why have Indigenous cultures been revered, romanticized, and appropriated for so long, and to this day?  Red Fever uncovers the surprising truths behind the imagery -- so buried in history that even most Native people don't know about them.","popularity":0.4527,"poster_path":"/1okQUmfVT62q67yh7qBPNinQmaj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36946,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rezolution Pictures","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Fever","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1261310,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Catherine Bainbridge","original_name":"Catherine Bainbridge","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/rE2ceVOw5GKjpLoNa1lybmSg5Nq.jpg","credit_id":"65f2457a35818f0188d070ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Diamond","original_name":"Neil Diamond","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/4o0DasKokALa7l6HsqmdZqoJ8xp.jpg","credit_id":"65f2454b06f984014842da1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208635,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rebecca Lessard","original_name":"Rebecca Lessard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66269b052e2b2c018768f4fe","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4668815,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pura Fé","original_name":"Pura Fé","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66269b42b9a0bd0161d5c07d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1209145,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Toussaint","original_name":"Daniel Toussaint","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66269b26b9a0bd0161d5c067","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1209145,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Toussaint","original_name":"Daniel Toussaint","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66269b52b2681f01a9750210","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1261310,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Catherine Bainbridge","original_name":"Catherine Bainbridge","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/rE2ceVOw5GKjpLoNa1lybmSg5Nq.jpg","credit_id":"66269b87197de401642b2291","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Diamond","original_name":"Neil Diamond","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/4o0DasKokALa7l6HsqmdZqoJ8xp.jpg","credit_id":"66269b7962f335017ddb2835","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208638,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jesse Zubot","original_name":"Jesse Zubot","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66269b332dda890187e3e620","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12432272","wikidata_id":"Q125693602","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xvMSziM9KmqpctypOcDXaVxZ8rv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4MUqSjA7BcRxuAg4RGIQNbsqpyn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1okQUmfVT62q67yh7qBPNinQmaj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":334530,"name":"western culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
