With photographs, taken by photographer Stojan Kerbler decades ago, of the village and its residents serving as a guide, the film crafts the portrait of a place through narrations, images, poetry and pure cinematic beauty. It may not be easy to describe how \"a tree grows in dreams\" in just a handful of words, but you can be sure that seeing it is nothing less than an experience beyond a mere viewing, something you experience like a dream or a caress, like a song that glides from your ears straight to your heart.","popularity":0.0713,"poster_path":"/vNZH1fOHcMRXT6ewWrQNKOLp1l1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108447,"logo_path":"/13Yd35SF2Av3TDkE7cGYwM3LjCN.png","name":"Filmsko društvo Film Factory","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":228392,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mali Film","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2024-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tree Grows in My Dreams Every Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3866466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vid Hajnšek","original_name":"Vid Hajnšek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f1e79efa4046018511650a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380246,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrej Nagode","original_name":"Andrej Nagode","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663b6b242cb33fde35b5aa62","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3866466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vid Hajnšek","original_name":"Vid Hajnšek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663b6b0f69c97ebfb205a2e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31546676","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vNZH1fOHcMRXT6ewWrQNKOLp1l1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"26th Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
