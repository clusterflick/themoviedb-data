Following 'One Zip Too Far,' Van Eerd returns this season with his own piece 'Double Trouble,' in which he plays a cunning plastic surgeon in a famous beauty clinic. He's not actually a doctor and makes his money easily with dubious treatments. But Van Eerd also portrays his bumbling twin brother who is forced to take the blame when the treatments don't go as planned. Lucie de Lange joins the chaos as the director of the institute, getting swept up in the hilarious tangle of mistakes and identity swaps. Once again, laughter proves to be the best medicine!","popularity":0.0431,"poster_path":"/3ShrPi1dofWFxNwfdBL7NC62lah.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double up!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon van Eerd","original_name":"Jon van Eerd","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/mxs8rewGPVdJ4ZZJvavpYE5lRJV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65f0c0d6a06645017c2c4862","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4588332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucie de Lange","original_name":"Lucie de Lange","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":"/bhoozJ5tTVeStdiAb5UODsir4io.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65f0c0e0d236e601864f2f18","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2053434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Roord","original_name":"Esther Roord","popularity":0.4123,"profile_path":"/gWDCLSxbXfXNIQwaRw0pVr2srzN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65f0c0fe0dea6e017cbc4f20","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4207836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjolein Algera","original_name":"Marjolein Algera","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65f0c10e55c1f4012f5022c6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Han Oldigs","original_name":"Han Oldigs","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/c1MLE1OQlqce6g77Dt4y6wiMuD7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65f0c11cb0040a01637f80fc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4588389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Koster","original_name":"Rolf Koster","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65f0c128253fab0186f86322","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31714903","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/3ShrPi1dofWFxNwfdBL7NC62lah.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
