This is the case when on April 27 2014, the canonization of the greatest Popes of the 20th century was celebrated\".  With these words, the unmistakable voice of Giancarlo Giannini introduces us to an intimate and emotional story of what was, in all respects, a historical event: the Canonization of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II. Monsignor Dario Edoardo Vigan√≤, director of the Vatican Television Center, holds the reins of the narrative which, among historical and exclusive images, leads to a closer understanding of the two Holy Popes and Pope Francis, and to discover places in the Vatican never seen before. Alongside him are the authoritative opinions of Pupi Avati, Aldo Grasso and Gianni Canova and a moving and emotional Dario Fo.
