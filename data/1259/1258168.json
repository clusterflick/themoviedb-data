Both leaders, Wolfe and Montcalm, died in the battle, which decided control over what would become Canada. Includes re-enactments of the battle and the personalities of the two commanders. For two months Montcalm and Quebec City endured English bombardments. However, in what the documentary describes as an exceptionally well planned operation during the night of September 12th, Wolfe got 4500 men and two cannons up L’Anse-au-Foulon cliffs to the Plains of Abraham. Montcalm, who never commanded an army before being posted to New France, chose to leave the city walls and try to fight a linear battle against a better trained army.","popularity":0.5801,"poster_path":"/wJtC2P1V9UDinx8b6Tvl00yOm16.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4896,"logo_path":"/zCUGLv6QxlEHngDCwlVolTZu8kF.png","name":"Galafilm","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":10323,"logo_path":"/uMlnpzZGM0rWxp69JU5cuAQEJbB.png","name":"Gedeon Programmes","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"La fin de la Nouvelle-France","title":"Battlefield Quebec: Wolfe & Montcalm","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3845389,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roman Jarymowycz","original_name":"Roman Jarymowycz","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"self","credit_id":"65f0af033dc8850185c588d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Holden","original_name":"Arthur Holden","popularity":0.423,"profile_path":"/c8FXyHhiVXCsjvwxXOzuVi28z3i.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Major General James Wolfe","credit_id":"65f0b07e55c1f4018750345c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian McKenna","original_name":"Brian McKenna","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65f0b09b253fab0186f84a52","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1856296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thierry Barthe","original_name":"Thierry Barthe","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/lghOV53Hd17DGL7kdOe3PO9Msac.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Louis-Joseph de Montcalm-Grozon, Marquis de Montcalm","credit_id":"65f0b0e7f495ee01647379ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Jeannin","original_name":"Marcel Jeannin","popularity":0.2093,"profile_path":"/u4cJlSYUA5T2dHQrR5meN23tHda.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"James Cook","credit_id":"65f0b13ca579f901867335f9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel Burton","original_name":"Noel Burton","popularity":0.1795,"profile_path":"/7Sj8iHUlE7QKwhE1DSnfSflktCC.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"James Henderson","credit_id":"65f0b18ca579f9013073233b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4588798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beat Berweger","original_name":"Beat Berweger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Louis-Antoine de Bougainville","credit_id":"65f0f30d470ead01629b3dc2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Préfontaine","original_name":"Claude Préfontaine","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/28N5yMrrFsKQa3A3HwuL1l5Xkmo.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Philippe de Vaudreuil","credit_id":"65f0f3372fdec601892049a6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flint Eagle","original_name":"Flint Eagle","popularity":0.2725,"profile_path":"/lJ8prWbNNz7GVpoRSsQgLtkmyQs.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"Indian Chief","credit_id":"65f0f349d64ac201875d3f33","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Brochu","original_name":"Daniel Brochu","popularity":0.2346,"profile_path":"/u1Y4I2b3LhjAHTBMdNh7jgN6NED.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Col.
