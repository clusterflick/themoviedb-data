Shot on analog hi8 tape and Jay's own iPhone, the film provides a direct experience into Jay's life, full of rough textures, dark humor, and endless non-sequiturs. We follow him inside the skeletal infrastructures of skyscrapers, ride along to record a song in Nashville at Third Man Records, enter his private creative sanctuaries, and examine the many unique artifacts he's collected throughout his journeys.","popularity":0.1,"poster_path":"/4ifQiWV6YNWd55SBByTk8XbQuUA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shotgun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4614978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Wade","original_name":"Jay Wade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6602110e197de401861bb240","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4588978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Devin Johnson","original_name":"Devin Johnson","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f1088d6dea3a017c786e93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5135244","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4ifQiWV6YNWd55SBByTk8XbQuUA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d0qt9iypUZL6MsEXYo9eXQGjM12.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Visions du Réel","release_date":"2018-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shotgun Full Movie","key":"zuQZGiDjYmI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-12-15T16:00:08.000Z","id":"65f106502fdec6013b20127f"}]}}}
