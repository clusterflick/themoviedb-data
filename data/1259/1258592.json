From 1924 until the fall of the USSR in 1991, the embalmed body of the hero of the October Revolution was publicly displayed as a holy relic. By using voice-over narration, the filmmaker directly addresses Lenin. Despite this freedom of expression, the archival images and comments of historians tell a different story: more than 24 years of Soviet history.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forever Lénine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0907881","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
