There he meets his cousin Andrea, who everyone calls \"Fundvogel\". Jan is fascinated by the young girl's beauty, and soon there is an erotic tension in the air between the two. Although they both have strong feelings for each other, they are afraid to make a commitment, even though their domineering grandmother is determined that they marry. Panicked that he might feel obliged to marry Andrea, Jan escapes from this place. Andrea is deeply disappointed and seeks revenge. Out of spite, she becomes involved with the falconer Bartel and is later raped in a wooden hut. The centigress, concerned about morals and customs, then sends Fundvogel to a convent. She escapes from there and flees into the arms of Jan. When he learns from a letter from the countess what has happened to Andrea, he leaves her a second time. In her despair, Fundvogel then throws herself off a bridge into the floods with suicidal intent.","popularity":0.2157,"poster_path":"/t5JpoLpFsg1dAsMYedcZysyMF3d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29439,"logo_path":null,"name":"Excelsior-Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1930-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No
