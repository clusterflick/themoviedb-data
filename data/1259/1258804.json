Marian Stafford, folk-singer Jared Reed, and The Bunin Puppets appear before and after each cartoon short. All of the cartoon shorts were originally released by Paramount, and included \"The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins (1943)\" - Betty Boop's \"Crazy Town (1932)\" - \"The Silly Goose/Dumme Ganslein, Der (1945)\" - \"The Busy Little Bears (1939)\" - \"Toys Will Be Toys (1949)\", and other Paramount cartoons, shorts and a couple of the audience-participation Screen Song singalong shorts. Strictly sold on a \"Park-the-kids-and-go-shopping\" or \"Cheap Baby-Sitting\" basis, and, since it was geared toward the kids, there was also a bath-room break intermission about halfway through the film. New footage and some of the cartoons in Technicolor, but a few of the cartoons were black-and-white.","popularity":0.2791,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":81263,"logo_path":"/piWo5aVphC63CuSKaCXuU1cRx6d.png","name":"APA : Artistes Producteurs Associ√©s","origin_country":"TN"},{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleischer Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Youngster's Own Show","title":"The Big Fun Carnival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4591071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Stafford","original_name":"Marian Stafford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mistress of Ceremonies","credit_id":"65f249ccfbe36f0162eec2da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2750958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jared Reed","original_name":"Jared Reed","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Folk Singer Jared Reed","credit_id":"65f249e76dea3a014978908a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Betty Boop","credit_id":"65f24a1efbe36f0185f03c18","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1345309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Fischerkoesen","original_name":"Hans Fischerkoesen","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/pph28re1MItiZ8v1rVSDPGhvmP9.jpg","credit_id":"65f24a856dea3a017c7b2ca8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82562,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louis M.
