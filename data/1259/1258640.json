For their three children, the forest is not only a vast playground but also something akin to a second home. However, as the refugee crisis casts its long shadow on the whole of Europe and Poland’s borders turn into one of the central scenes of this drama, with unwelcome refugees trapped between two countries, the family’s quiet days seem numbered. Aiding “illegal immigrants” is prohibited by their country’s laws, but how does one refuse to help someone in need? Discovering a captivating, poetic equilibrium between the deeply personal and the essentially political, Forest brings to the forefront the natural landscape, as well as the characters’ emotional environment, crafting a film that resonates loudly and goes beyond pompous statements.","popularity":0.1903,"poster_path":"/fVBnbKKHhQPrPi84TBKN6BU48VU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lonely
