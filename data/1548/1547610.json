Each sequence begins with Devereaux's hand compressing a bag, then releasing it — allowing the material to slowly expand. The initial release is rapid, but the motion soon settles into a meditative, near-slow-motion unfurling, drawing attention to the subtle behavior of shape, light, and texture. Inspired by a live performance Devereaux witnessed of avant-garde composer Takehisa Kosugi — specifically his act of wrapping a microphone in paper during a performance at the Getty Center's Rajikaru! conference — the film channels a similar spirit of experimental material interaction, silence, and focused perception. Unfurl invites viewers to observe slowness and transformation as a form of quiet performance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tPg4y9oGjMMNwVZXdlavksdLGKC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unfurl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5640861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Devereaux","original_name":"Max Devereaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fpagARmQKYPgYMxZVDglUlwhtY5.jpg","credit_id":"68c9faffe123aa60d1de8138","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bTuYyB4CCo1fbhaDtg3hfjjWZSB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tPg4y9oGjMMNwVZXdlavksdLGKC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":188577,"name":"plastic bag"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":356058,"name":"performance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EUJpbBaUUw","release_date":"2023-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Unfurl (2023) Max Devereaux Short Film","key":"0EUJpbBaUUw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-05-24T21:34:19.000Z","id":"68c9faa94663bf94f21f1f86"}]}}}
