Ponting during Captain Robert Falcon Scott’s ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition (1910–1913), this 1912 documentary presented British audiences with the first moving pictures of Antarctica. Sponsored and distributed by Gaumont, the multi-reel program showed the Terra Nova ship, the Cape Evans base camp, daily routines of the expedition team, Antarctic wildlife, and striking scenes of the ice landscape. Released in London in 1912—before news of Scott’s death reached Britain—it became enormously popular, combining scientific record with patriotic spectacle.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/zeWSsvymLc3r2LYobWwrj4eKPDW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":274378,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gaumont Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1912-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With Captain Scott in the Antarctic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Terra Nova Expedition","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"With Captain Scott","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","title":"With Captain Scott to the South Pole","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Captain Scott’s South Pole Expedition","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert G.
