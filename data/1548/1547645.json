As eminent domain, the internet and changing technologies threaten everything he has built, he struggles to find a way to keep moving forward. Inspired by his unique stories and abilities, filmmaker and professor John C. Aliano follows him over the course of several years and reflects on his own career trajectory.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oBIRZ3MDMHDDC1aM1BnV6a3xWGN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Being Adolph Gasser","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5693557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolph Gasser","original_name":"Adolph Gasser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68ca1c65aa3858783713f441","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5693563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John C.
