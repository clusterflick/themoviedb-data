Each evening, Ben takes to the streets of Brussels to distribute bread to the most disadvantaged and offer his empty hotel rooms to the homeless, undocumented migrants, (trans)migrants, etc. who need a place to stay and relax. Working entirely as a volunteer and motivated by the Koran, he refuses to keep his luxury for himself and shares it with all those who need it. Paradisiac is a kaleidoscopic portrait that gives a glimpse into this fragile and extraordinary ‘Mozart universe’.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yPJj6PGUzioMgDXau1akPOCu0uu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112785,"logo_path":null,"name":"RITCS School of Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2022-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradisiac","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5113038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bas Van Hoeck","original_name":"Bas Van Hoeck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c96de5790a6d77c878bfbe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1610,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yPJj6PGUzioMgDXau1akPOCu0uu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1122}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeunes premiers, jeunes premières","release_date":"2022-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
