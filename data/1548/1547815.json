Through fragments of memory and symbolic scenes, we follow her trembling hands as they shape clay, while her body and spirit search for the strength to rise again. The clay, fragile and resilient at the same time, becomes an extension of her own rebirth. Between the memory of violence and the decision to heal, Nueva Forma is a visual ode to the power of resilience and creation.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/oL5Nr6X60ejF7qqpnWPH3gJ3o3y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":268841,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Güeso Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nueva Forma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2714642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Génesis Estévez","original_name":"Génesis Estévez","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":"/3Wk8pVr6HgFoZuv33LRxRWXbzOu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"ELLA","credit_id":"68caa60a52a2c034201f073b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5694350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Reynoso","original_name":"José Reynoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"EL","credit_id":"68caa6c8299514971ce36271","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4485134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viviana C.
