Born within a year of each other, both used landscape painting to reflect the changing world around them. Tate Britain is bringing these two greats together for a groundbreaking exhibition, in London from November 2025 to April 2026, and Exhibition on Screen once again has exclusive and privileged access to bring their extraordinary art and remarkable stories to the big screen in February so that you can enjoy both film and exhibition together. Discover unexpected sides to both artists with intimate views of sketchbooks and personal items and insights from leading experts.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/cDBUokpY8ySLef7Er5hbY5guFfJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Art Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2026-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Turner & Constable","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bickerstaff","original_name":"David Bickerstaff","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ca8309f4942933f0e4fa80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Grabsky","original_name":"Phil Grabsky","popularity":0.0715,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ca831ae123aa60d1de82b6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833712,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amanda Wilkie","original_name":"Amanda Wilkie","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ca832ca1b83b2aa7e36210","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406727,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Asa Bennett","original_name":"Asa Bennett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ca833f9d6b6c010913f5b6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38351582","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cDBUokpY8ySLef7Er5hbY5guFfJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2026-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
