Based on interviews conducted by Hélène and previously unpublished documents, the film traces the lives of Donna and some of her loved ones. The voices of Donna, her sister Myla, and friends like Jill intertwine, composing a choral and fragmentary narrative, where the intimate meets collective history. The film recreates an era—that of a generation of queer women who were committed, precarious, and often invisible.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":154747,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hutong Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":153085,"logo_path":"/xksYNGY2stlw20TfIM7Iutl02l1.png","name":"LE BAL","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Want My People to Be Remembered","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5694676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donna Gottschalk","original_name":"Donna Gottschalk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68cad04541d974f7a913f815","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5694682,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sasha J.
