Each experiences a different facet of loss.  The first is planning her mother's funeral, the second is dealing with her brother and the death of their shared father, and the third is trying to move on to a new life. While the protagonists have to decide which garment to wear at the cremation, how to address their brother after years of distance, or what technique to use to cut spare ribs, they move through their worlds with sometimes more, sometimes less humor. And again and again the question arises whether pain can be shared.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/6vrnSTlPFOuCEh3kbmALSVkZ0LZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rips","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3189811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah
