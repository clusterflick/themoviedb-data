After Tomas helps a farmer reload his overturned rice cart, he is targeted by the communist Huks for recruitment to their cause. The Huks indoctrinate Tomas, talking to him for hours until he decides to leave his home and join them. The Huks send Tomas to speak with the farmer about sharing his rice, but this turns out to be a diversion. When the farmer stands up for his rights, one of the Huks stabs him with a machete and takes his rice. As the film ends, Tomas realizes that he has become a murderer and will be trapped in a miserable existence as a Huk forever. The film is presented in the form of a puppet show\" (US National Archives).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6boQXmFvWANkZo00eRwpUiOvtWl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79918,"logo_path":"/aRdHimsFTCuxhzQ0yG4yohKOxQk.png","name":"United States Information Agency (USIA)","origin_country":"US"},{"id":274404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Freedom Films","origin_country":""},{"id":274009,"logo_path":null,"name":"United States Information Service (USIS)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1952-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tomas and the Huks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cTW96CGE0v0FO8CslnUysGTE08o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6boQXmFvWANkZo00eRwpUiOvtWl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Distributed via USIS channels, likely had reach beyond Philippines given the English dub on the film.
