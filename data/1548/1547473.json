As filmmaker Toby Hubner follows the trail of extreme wealth, he is forced to confront his own expectations, background, and place in the world. The result is a sharp and deeply human look at who gets ahead in America, who gets left behind, and what that does to our sense of purpose. Is the American Dream still attainable? Or was it always a mirage? The answers are surprising.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/kkYZ49MV4vD5FqrqBLJei19y8Fq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bold Exploration of Wealth, Inequality, and Identity in Modern America","title":"The $238 Million Dollar Apartment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32593444","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kkYZ49MV4vD5FqrqBLJei19y8Fq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
