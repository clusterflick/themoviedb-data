With still dynamic growth, the Soviet economy was consolidating mass production in several economic sectors. The examples used in the documentary, the ZIL, KamAZ factories and the construction of the Baikal-Amur railway (BAM) seek to demonstrate the development of this centralized economy. Attention was also paid to the new technologies of integrated circuits, which enabled economic calculations, previously impossible to be processed manually. The automation of industries was also addressed by the documentary. The marxist idea presented was that the automation of industries in Soviet Union don't promoted layoffs, as a result of the contradictions between work and capital, which occur in capitalist countries.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":246959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lennauchfilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"USSR: A Society Without Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5694207,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"R.
