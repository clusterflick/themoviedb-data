Filmed across Tokyo (Nakano, Ekoda, Shinjuku, Chiyoda, and along the Chuo Line), Matsumoto in Nagano, and Ukyo in Kyoto, the film captures fleeting, seemingly mundane moments that held deep personal significance for the filmmaker. Each shot captures a distinct moment when Devereaux felt his nervous system decompress just enough to be inclined to film — moments of stillness and clarity amid the motion of travel and creative exploration.  Waking Up is both a poetic travelogue and a personal awakening. Echoing his own words — \"When I arrived in Japan, it felt like I had finally woken up from a bad dream\" — the film offers a meditative window into moments of quiet revelation, captured not for spectacle but for memory.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/MjqYKBKNqgQ4Zyt9Laa1JgWqQJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2025-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waking Up","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5640861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Devereaux","original_name":"Max Devereaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fpagARmQKYPgYMxZVDglUlwhtY5.jpg","credit_id":"68ca03055273fd225ae4f92b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wYflHweWWkey11h9tnLzCehXs5G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/MjqYKBKNqgQ4Zyt9Laa1JgWqQJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233,"name":"japan"},{"id":9935,"name":"travel"},{"id":180482,"name":"kyoto, japan"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":322369,"name":"tokyo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Hx8uRrqB4","release_date":"2025-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Waking Up (2025) Max Devereaux Short Film","key":"y8Hx8uRrqB4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-05-13T22:38:33.000Z","id":"68ca02a227aa6eb8491f04e8"}]}}}
