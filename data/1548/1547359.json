The young filmmaker, faithful to her craft, turns a painting that obsesses her into a tableau vivant: it is her own way of painting. There is another painting that bewitches her: it is the last one her grandfather painted, and it remained unfinished. Using her brushes, she now wants to finish what her grandfather left unfinished.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2024-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Retrato de la luz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5692327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Gabriela Morales","original_name":"Ana Gabriela Morales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c96a4d4da47a8b02c13c37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
