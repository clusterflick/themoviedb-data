The film engages with contemporary issues of identity and allegories of artistic practice, and is influenced by Jean Cocteau and Maya Deren’s films (particularly their creation of  visual ‘dreamscapes’), Nobuhiko Ôbayashi (especially his editing processes) and Lee Miller’s embodiment of both the artist and the artist’s muse in her work both in front of and behind the camera.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/flOJE7fH3rfPhBRQKisuxh32MWb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":255432,"logo_path":null,"name":"Space Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":167533,"logo_path":null,"name":"ICA London","origin_country":""},{"id":274311,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stop Play Record","origin_country":""},{"id":255787,"logo_path":null,"name":"Channel Four Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Untitled Sequence\", is an artist film that explores the material processes of filmmaking through sets, props, and animation.","title":"Untitled Sequence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léna Lewis-King","original_name":"Léna Lewis-King","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/e3jTLwTVcgzXHV9CkIOuR7vHZWq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68c89b54459a83dcec5d4a02","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1994894,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gabi Norland","original_name":"Gabi Norland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c89b70a7a3ae26805d4a0a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léna Lewis-King","original_name":"Léna Lewis-King","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/e3jTLwTVcgzXHV9CkIOuR7vHZWq.jpg","credit_id":"68c89b8f8870962ccd21922b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5691358,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Whitman","original_name":"Thomas Whitman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c89bc65cf6bd264f804d0c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léna Lewis-King","original_name":"Léna Lewis-King","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/e3jTLwTVcgzXHV9CkIOuR7vHZWq.jpg","credit_id":"68c89be6d7e46c3e620c10c3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léna Lewis-King","original_name":"Léna Lewis-King","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/e3jTLwTVcgzXHV9CkIOuR7vHZWq.jpg","credit_id":"68c89bf768154607d4c13991","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rn6eNoQY13wZ0eRYXXgjHS32mjo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Z5JJGqCf8JJQTNejD08ZRxUQgm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1682,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/flOJE7fH3rfPhBRQKisuxh32MWb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1132}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3307,"name":"surreal"},{"id":172624,"name":"dream logic"},{"id":209220,"name":"live action and animation"},{"id":256059,"name":"neo-surrealism"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"},{"id":305843,"name":"art film"},{"id":323608,"name":"first film"},{"id":324538,"name":"first time filmmaker"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ICA London, Random Acts","release_date":"2017-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
