This small portrait of Judas Icarus is expressed not through a continuity of events, but through the human touch, forms of light, and repeated movements which surround his recovery.  Featuring a cast of active PNW based pro wrestlers and musicians, Judas Icarus Twists His Wrist is inspired by the narratives found in pro-wrestling. Where the “real-life” documentary elements and fictionalized drama begin and end may blur, but one thing is for certain - the hits are real.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Judas Icarus Twists His Wrist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3094919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Kingdon","original_name":"Christian Kingdon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Judas Icarus","credit_id":"68c9b9a2bbb9164c130c156d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1354745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kerr Holden","original_name":"Kerr Holden","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9c53dd72841c7b3dcd4c3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1354745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kerr Holden","original_name":"Kerr Holden","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9c58f00f6338dc680517c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2535890,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Suzanne Friesen","original_name":"Suzanne Friesen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9c5cff17d9d38e478c154","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
