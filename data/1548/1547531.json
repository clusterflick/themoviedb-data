Many of its sequences reveal the fingerprints of USIA and the American imaginary of Vietnam, moving between sweeping pastoral shots, montages of military preparedness, and scenes of graphic simulated violence upon people of the South—making the film ultimately prowar. However, the documentary renders a complicated, almost paradoxical visual expression of homeland defense. Instead of framing victory as likely and death as something to avoid, the allusions to familiar mythology cosmically situate the South’s resistance as a tragic duty that spans the long history of their nation\" (Vukoder and Gharabaghi).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/krXMmftJ8uAia6yStmP1uGAxUWG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":274410,"logo_path":null,"name":"RVN Psychological Warfare Department","origin_country":""},{"id":274411,"logo_path":null,"name":"RVN Department of Defense","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sons of Hai Ba Trung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5692966,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Do Linh Thong","original_name":"Do Linh Thong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9c505e4c126bae38c557f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bùi Sơn Duân","original_name":"Bùi Sơn Duân","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9c524a7a1a0ab1ce51d56","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5692968,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nguyen Van Quy","original_name":"Nguyen Van Quy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9c583fd93d5466adcd478","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5692969,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bui Nhi","original_name":"Bui Nhi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9c59d06402ac3cfdcd4cd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5692970,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ð. uŷ Lê Nhu Khôi","original_name":"Ð. uŷ Lê Nhu Khôi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9c5eac8264dc81221975d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5692971,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Trân Ðinh Lâm","original_name":"Trân Ðinh Lâm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9c645a7a1a0ab1ce51d6b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5692972,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ðai uý Pham Gia Nghi","original_name":"Ðai uý Pham Gia Nghi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9c6905675e8277e78c01a","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5692973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duong Quy Binh","original_name":"Duong Quy Binh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9c6bdea314cf5fa2195e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lRFv1hf0Wh0K98FF68p8BOpxRlm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o5blZik6aii7BUphYzkk5Che8lJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/krXMmftJ8uAia6yStmP1uGAxUWG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"This would have been distributed in Vietnamese, too, of course.
