Well received at its premiere, followed by international success, which still makes it the most performed French opera in the world today, just behind Carmen. But should we take this Faust literally? Or should we see it, in the twist of the fable, as a celebration of pleasures? The audience can enjoy all the excesses, intoxicated by the music... without risking damnation. In Opéra de Lille’s production, this contradiction does not escape astute analysis of director Denis Podalydès. Podalydès and his distinguished team tackles Goethe's tragic hero, using Jules Barbier's spoken dialogues, which were part of the work when it was first performed in 1859, to bring out all its ambiguities.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/1TR98KwYoyTokQujkfOyVPoiFor.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra de Lille","origin_country":""},{"id":131385,"logo_path":null,"name":"OperaVision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":195,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faust – Opéra de Lille","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Dran","original_name":"Julien Dran","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Faust","credit_id":"68c9935448a028bc2621957a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vannina Santoni","original_name":"Vannina Santoni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7TFSWMzkEWQhPpAHNyTMPfxbP4y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marguerite","credit_id":"68c9936623b7c460d678c0cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2458215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerome Boutillier","original_name":"Jerome Boutillier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Méphistophélès","credit_id":"68c99378809ef02b328c54a3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Lhote","original_name":"Lionel Lhote","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Valentin","credit_id":"68c9938923b7c460d678c0d2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5692656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliette Mey","original_name":"Juliette Mey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Siebel","credit_id":"68c993a266ffa1411f219616","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3553061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anas Seguin","original_name":"Anas Seguin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Wagner","credit_id":"68c993b06641dd5e08804fe8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Lenormand","original_name":"Marie Lenormand","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Dame Marthe","credit_id":"68c993c2a59cd175768c54f3","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49502,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charles Gounod","original_name":"Charles Gounod","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/6zNtHmKEC0AssjgC8iyhjR4njPy.jpg","credit_id":"68c993dcc4c0b5b3cae51ea2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590583,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jules Barbier","original_name":"Jules Barbier","popularity":0.8397,"profile_path":"/zhVqhaYv2vyzWFHZCuno5iDZPHz.jpg","credit_id":"68c993ed402158020c0c13fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572099,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michel Carré","original_name":"Michel Carré","popularity":0.9028,"profile_path":"/x3zZWBJPfk2zM3FIyQw8qoyT05g.jpg","credit_id":"68c993fda973d06d1580503a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Podalydès","original_name":"Denis Podalydès","popularity":0.1821,"profile_path":"/uKEvUFBjdkDuNQgDoEVwFw1TvSa.jpg","credit_id":"68c9941662cfad5aa4c13da2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Langrée","original_name":"Louis Langrée","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9942508718ca1402196d9","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":797,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1TR98KwYoyTokQujkfOyVPoiFor.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TEASER | FAUST Gounod – Opéra de Lille","key":"2WJQngQJ9dM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2025-09-08T14:10:01.000Z","id":"68c995800514e6dd515d4e13"}]}}}
