After stealing a stash of money and drugs, aging raver David (Marc Bessant) crashes his car deep in the woods - trapped in the wreckage, injured and helpless, he hangs suspended between life and death. When a mysterious poacher (Jason Williamson) discovers him, no rescue comes, only a watchful, unsettling presence that seems intent on letting nature finish the job. As the hours stretch and the elements close in, a tense and claustrophobic battle of wills, and wits, unfolds - where survival hinges on outlasting both the wilderness and the predator at its edge.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"A thriller set during the '90s British rave scene, where two men, one a thief and one a poacher, must use their wits to survive.","title":"Game","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1802583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Williamson","original_name":"Jason Williamson","popularity":0.3074,"profile_path":"/lZtvf9n0accB3hf9lckuXobt3jJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68c9be84ac8eb90ab6219697","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1748374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Bessant","original_name":"Marc Bessant","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68c9be9d333c107ab3219660","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2211513,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Minton","original_name":"John Minton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9beb93b5bda5193e51dac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78441,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Geoff Barrow","original_name":"Geoff Barrow","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/xWC6TK73Re2kfYgMJgLI7eyK88J.jpg","credit_id":"68c9bed3e959dcf87edcd5ef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1748374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Bessant","original_name":"Marc Bessant","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9bef9a49754e2818c5657","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2211513,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Minton","original_name":"John Minton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9bf0ad81d302498dce465","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5692940,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rob Williams","original_name":"Rob Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9bf31a7a1a0ab1ce51d3a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5692942,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rob Williams","original_name":"Rob Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9bf459ffaaba448dcd560","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78441,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Geoff Barrow","original_name":"Geoff Barrow","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/xWC6TK73Re2kfYgMJgLI7eyK88J.jpg","credit_id":"68c9bf579ffaaba448dcd564","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5692946,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Deborah Rawlings","original_name":"Deborah Rawlings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c9bf661872be5351e51c79","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38044308","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10349,"name":"survival"},{"id":315058,"name":"horror"},{"id":316362,"name":"thriller"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
