Loss is not linear—it loops, twists, and folds back on itself. We fall, we process, we heal, but we might fall again.  Through a lyrical exploration of the five stages of grief, the film reveals how loss extends beyond the physical—encompassing identity, self-worth, relationships, and sense of direction. Each stage offers a different lens, a new way of seeing how we break, mend, and break again. Is healing the destination, or just another step in the cycle? No matter where you begin, you’ll follow the rhythm—because healing isn’t out of reach. You’re just still processing.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Processing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5415646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonia Mutaganzwa","original_name":"Sonia Mutaganzwa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681780c5c18b196deea2156d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5415648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Luc Niyonshuti","original_name":"Jean Luc Niyonshuti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681780dc59d70418c2913389","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
