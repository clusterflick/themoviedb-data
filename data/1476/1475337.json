Originally private, both the diary and the game are now performed publicly, with the camera alternating between the performers and the audience, emphasising voyeurism and shared intimacy.  Exhibited at Tate Britain alongside Atkins’ writings, paintings, embroideries, video works, and drawings, Nurses come and go, but none for me (2025) marks both Hartwig Art Foundation’s first commission of a work by Ed Atkins and the artist's debut feature-length film.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/2SXIkqNtwbSXxUjTy0NGgTWVfBQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":261285,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hartwig Art Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":135828,"logo_path":null,"name":"Danish Arts Foundation","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2024-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nurses Come and Go, But None for Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toby Jones","original_name":"Toby Jones","popularity":3.8418,"profile_path":"/eOZe7EZ0Ojq8PaIn1HLVex5dZwc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"681774615ae2f3b8b98b65a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saskia Reeves","original_name":"Saskia Reeves","popularity":1.7936,"profile_path":"/dTzb4BHZ9T9O2kNgNgTuMtGQ8rB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68177478a80e8a4e9aa21558","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5415557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bella Aubin","original_name":"Bella Aubin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68177495e531f0f58d576e17","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5415559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Elms","original_name":"Caroline Elms","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"681774ab2dc731ed4908a260","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5415562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Misheck freeman","original_name":"Misheck freeman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"681774cd5f9ca5ac99a215b9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5415564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chengxi Fu","original_name":"Chengxi Fu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"681774e3cb42f7195384cee3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4992188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfie Jallow","original_name":"Alfie Jallow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"681774f70716dd414408a17e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5415571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayesha Ostler","original_name":"Ayesha Ostler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6817752323b73a407491349d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4112984,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tom Lyons","original_name":"Tom Lyons","popularity":0.224,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"681777490d356ee5cc0317fd","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Atkins","original_name":"Ed Atkins","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":"/yaFe7uQGwGBNJEVNtdtHdBn6oyf.jpg","credit_id":"6817756e1e995845880317ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5415581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Zultanski","original_name":"Steven Zultanski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6817758961921791d91d0c0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2SXIkqNtwbSXxUjTy0NGgTWVfBQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
