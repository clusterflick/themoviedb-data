To make matters more complicated, the butcher, unbeknownst to our protagonist, is trans-masculine, and Suzanne is not exactly LGBTQ+ aware; she’s overtly dismissive of her non-binary teenager’s gender identity, Ruth. Things come to a head when Tom invites Tracy, his estranged adult niece, to dinner. Suzanne visits her butcher and prepares a prime cut exactly as he suggests. Later, when the doorbell rings, she’s met with a shocking surprise. This mystery family member is the butcher – the butcher is Tracy. As the evening progresses, Suzanne must navigate her conflicting desires, face her prejudices, and acknowledge a deep-seated longing for something more.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Flesh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2537213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Silverman","original_name":"Miriam Silverman","popularity":0.9215,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6816e8d229ddacd48da21494","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1981849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric T.
