If you saw her would you know her? Is she naughty or is she nice? And where is she anyway? This film takes a playful look at the figure of “Sandra from Bandra” – part covetous fantasy of the racy Christian girl from Bombay who works as a secretary, wears a dress and likes to dance; part condescending stereotype of a dowdy, religious girl from a minority community. The film searches for Sandra in Bollywood films, in the words of writers and poets, on the gravestones in Bandra’s churchyard. We encounter various claimants to the title – some who aren’t from Bandra and some who aren’t even called Sandra. Finally we find 5 women who really are Sandra from Bandra, each as different from the other as can be even if they are all a little bit the same.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":261310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Celebrate Bandra Trust","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2005-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where's Sandra?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1879419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paromita Vohra","original_name":"Paromita Vohra","popularity":0.1324,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6817c776ae3fd4edaf84d0d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2247682,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sankalp Meshram","original_name":"Sankalp Meshram","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6817c785efdd9940601d0d19","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927833,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jabeen Merchant","original_name":"Jabeen Merchant","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6817c79a0840a2755c1d0d98","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1729520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Avijit Mukul Kishore","original_name":"Avijit Mukul Kishore","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6817c7b6ff54526bf10316ec","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007867,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anita Kushwahar","original_name":"Anita Kushwahar","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6817c7e6ae4da1cd9508a37e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6RTjAqY9c9gYLkUqGV2UIAaiE2H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1917}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Where's Sandra","key":"ZnsAjSZSzUw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2015-09-15T08:23:59.000Z","id":"6817c89f6ea216a5e984d3ea"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Where's Sandra Trailer","key":"ooy3bnvMagM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-05-19T07:12:50.000Z","id":"6817c85fff54526bf1031704"}]}}}
