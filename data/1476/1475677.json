Each resentful of the others presence, they refuse to acknowledge in full the existence of the other. Against the backdrop of some unspecified global conflict they cling to a monotonous, unyielding routine of work, eat, sleep. When one of the workers abruptly disappears without explanation the other is left alone, devoid of all human contact. He elects to carry on with his routine and becomes prone to increased fatigue, paranoia and experiences a strange visitation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scottish Screen","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Six Hours of Daylight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rab Affleck","original_name":"Rab Affleck","popularity":1.2185,"profile_path":"/56bCkeBCFWEtfz3qbiqpMt61Ugy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"681804fbd0c1c5586d913884","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garry Stewart","original_name":"Garry Stewart","popularity":0.1587,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6818050cd5c815e0c91d0e33","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1626690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kern Falconer","original_name":"Kern Falconer","popularity":0.2588,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"681805289126b7a2f9a216ec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5416898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fiona Henderson","original_name":"Fiona Henderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6818052fefc68d68929087db","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287994,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joseph Briffa","original_name":"Joseph Briffa","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68180493efc68d68929087c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5416894,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katie Nicoll","original_name":"Katie Nicoll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681804ae81a866f400908995","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1273154,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ossie McLean","original_name":"Ossie McLean","popularity":0.6075,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681804caaa63f61b6e031961","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287994,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joseph Briffa","original_name":"Joseph Briffa","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681804e859d70418c291352e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1754505","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
