The former showcase the façades of homes in my former South Los Angeles neighborhood as well as commercial structures in various stages of disrepair alongside the adjacent decommissioned BNSF railway. The latter showcase similar Black & Brown neighborhoods in East and Southeast Houston currently facing gentrification and that remind me of my former home in Los Angeles. This new sequence of photographs is superimposed with a voiceover dialogue that re-frames these architectural structures and their materiality as ephemeral embodiments of histories and cultures.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(be)coming home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5412036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Almendárez","original_name":"Francis Almendárez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68179f24fb2d00566c8b64b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
