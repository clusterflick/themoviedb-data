My Name is Blotto: The Movie","overview":"Scrappy documentary about a band that flew too close to the sun to make it really big. Albany, NY's Blotto rose from the ashes of the Star-Spangled Washboard Band and scored an unlikely hit with I Wanna Be A Lifeguard in the early 80's  thanks in part to  getting airplay on MTV when the network launched August 1, 1981. The film follows their struggles to land a major label deal despite huge success with touring and releasing their own EPs and Albums. First-time director Rob Lichter (aka Bert Blotto) puts together a funny, heart-felt portrait of the musical pranksters that is sometimes heartbreaking despite all the laughs.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4SDA078q9DHYcryXWV3qrWjZ7m5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hello!
