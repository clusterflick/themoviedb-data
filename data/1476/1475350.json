Filmed in the tense weeks following the M23 rebels’ capture of Goma, 'Café Kuba' immerses viewers in the shifting narratives of a city where memory is not static but constantly reshaped by present realities. Through ambient recordings and an evolving musical score, Shongo transforms these anonymous voices into a portrait of Kinshasa’s active memory, mirroring how personal and collective histories are continuously retrieved, reinterpreted, and lived.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Café Kuba - Who Dared to Awaken the Dead Memory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Shongo","original_name":"David Shongo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68177f07ae4da1cd9508a1db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
