A stream of junk and weather falls onto a digital stage, forming a growing pile. Generated in real time using a modified Unreal Engine, the piece is a live physics simulation—scripted but different with each run. It’s not a recording, but a rudimentary game that plays itself. Atkins conceived it as a kind of stripped-back theatre, aiming to distill drama to its bleakest form: a sequence of falling objects creating an accumulating spectacle. Initially imagined as a live stage production, the concept proved too costly and impractical. The digital simulation became a fantastical and fitting substitute.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/29UIhUMRQFpzeVyMdkCrO8HATx5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Refuse.exe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Atkins","original_name":"Ed Atkins","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":"/yaFe7uQGwGBNJEVNtdtHdBn6oyf.jpg","credit_id":"68177301a0267c25fd1d0c8c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1424,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/29UIhUMRQFpzeVyMdkCrO8HATx5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":949}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
