In 921, an embassy was sent from Baghdad to the land of Bulgar, the head of whose religious mission was Ibn Fadlan. He described his observations along the route, which ran through different countries, peoples and cultures. The path of the embassy, which lasted almost a year, was full of hardships, obstacles and dangers. It was with the arrival of the embassy in 922 that the adoption of Islam by Volga Bulgaria as the official religion was connected. In the documentary part of the film, experts will talk about the historical background of the formation of the religious and ethnic identity of Muslims in Russia. In artistic game episodes, an attempt is made to reconstruct the realities of 921-922, where the heroes are Ibn Fadlan, the ruler of the Bulgar Almush and their entourage.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/iu5Dxhk6jKDvAFMsiiGhboghsxi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ibn Fadlan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Ибн Фадлан","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3348839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asan Bilâlov","original_name":"Asan Bilâlov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Elteber Almush","credit_id":"6817e577b197e91fb408a3df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5416577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lenar Gilmutdinov","original_name":"Lenar Gilmutdinov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Abdullah ibn Bashtu","credit_id":"6817e5efe14a825cc68b64be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5416579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Almaz Sabirzyanov","original_name":"Almaz Sabirzyanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bulan","credit_id":"6817e5ff160e95569a1d0e1a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5416580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zulfat Zakirov","original_name":"Zulfat Zakirov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ahmed ibn Fadlan","credit_id":"6817e611f2baa68a4e908680","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5416583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ainaz Mukhametzyanov","original_name":"Ainaz Mukhametzyanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6817e628228fbfc206031a25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2780025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudolf Khaynurov","original_name":"Rudolf Khaynurov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6817e648a08b20a5e446184a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5416583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ainaz Mukhametzyanov","original_name":"Ainaz Mukhametzyanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6817e65b12fd9fa97e1d0ebc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5416587,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ramis Nazmiev","original_name":"Ramis Nazmiev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6817e66db85865d98a8b65e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26118436","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1540,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/iu5Dxhk6jKDvAFMsiiGhboghsxi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1026}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
