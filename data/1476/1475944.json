She tells him that she's helping a man out by the name of John Mounsey, “he only has four weeks left to live” and wants to document his last days on film. Since then, Wheeler and Mounsey have been chatting and collaborating. The Zen Art of Stone Squeezing is a by-product of a film Wheeler is making about a precognitive dream that involves John dancing in his own coffin. John takes us through his life of being a Dry Stone Waller and how by integrating Kung Fu into his practice, he has been able to overcome adversity and live a life of poetry, where inner places seem to match and coincide with the physical landscapes he finds himself working in.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/lSD8A12ZInetjgZBkmvBVexvB9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Zen Art of Stone Squeezing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5417868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Mounsey","original_name":"John Mounsey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6818b8d83bd3b31171a2192c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5417873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meg Mounsey","original_name":"Meg Mounsey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6818b9d51c11b05af263ff8b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5417874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mounsey","original_name":"Jack Mounsey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6818b9ece7013cec08487898","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5417867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Wheeler","original_name":"Harry Wheeler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6818b8a48c372dbd88a217f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5417867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Wheeler","original_name":"Harry Wheeler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6818b8ba160e95569a1d10d5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ThKavFBzDZ9bWcrItPeyVCHVNc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lSD8A12ZInetjgZBkmvBVexvB9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":294531,"name":"documentary film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
