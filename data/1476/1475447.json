A deal is quickly struck: the devil serves Faust on earth, and after Faust's death it is to be the other way around. Marguerite is also not unimpressed by what Méphistophélès has to offer: material luxury and sensual pleasure, often musically illustrated by Gounod with a waltz. But the relationship between Faust and Marguerite remains an episode, as Faust is drawn to new attractions, while Marguerite remains pregnant, only to see her unfaithful lover kill her brother.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/rEQfwrZt5l56K3b0ZmC0U1eIXlF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":176,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faust
