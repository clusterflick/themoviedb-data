Do we appreciate them or take them for granted? Do we even notice the little joys in life that make us smile at the most unexpected moments? Do these moments pass us by or do we live them? Do we recall them in our weaker moments or do they fade into oblivion? This documentary, brought to life in animation, seeks answers to these questions. People are interviewed about the best moments of their day, of different genders, nationalities, ages and social backgrounds. The film gives us the space to overcome stereotypes and distances and helps us to discover the unity inherent in our humanity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2023-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Best Moment of the Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5417735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zsuzsa Sándor","original_name":"Zsuzsa Sándor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6818a47d9011dc112f4878dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
