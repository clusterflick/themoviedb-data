The film brings together two strangers. Tracy is a young woman running from her past, who is sought out by Adam, an 11-year old boy beaten and adrift. Adam is a mystery to us, as he is to Tracy. All we know, is that he needs to go 'home'. A strange tattoo on Adam's lip is their only guide. Circumstance brings them together, their destinies more profoundly connected than either had imagined.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"I need to go home.","title":"Three Thousand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5288546","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
