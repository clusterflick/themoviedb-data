Two guided visits through the eyes of the people who inhabit each place.  In Marseille, a deteriorated housing project is surrounded by walls cutting it off from the neighbouring private properties.  In Calais, the fences and and the barbwire aim to push back the refugees hoping to reach the UK and build a better life there.  \"Écoute les murs tomber\" (Listen to the Walls Fall) shows how human beings, moved by the desire to come and go, to live and to set themselves free from restrictions and dead ends, bypass what imprison them, prevent them and restrain them. When coming face-to-face with walls, \"Écoute les murs tomber\" offers pathways of hope.","popularity":0.2259,"poster_path":"/pKkfgxDuZyGk65YkOPSXQ3VtomB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":233904,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Friche","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Écoute les murs tomber","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4830334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léo Kekemenis","original_name":"Léo Kekemenis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6694b47a27501d1f22bac109","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pKkfgxDuZyGk65YkOPSXQ3VtomB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233016,"name":"segregation"},{"id":330881,"name":"borders"},{"id":334892,"name":"walls"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
