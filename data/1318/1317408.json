At the height of her fame, Winx became known as the “people’s horse”—an Australian icon who transcended her sport—joining the realms of fellow legends like Cathy Freeman and Sir Donald Bradman. Although the world’s greatest racehorse retired in 2019, she’s still breaking records. Winx’s only foal sold this year at auction for a world record $10 million dollars. During her reign, huge crowds descended on racetracks across Australia to witness the Phar Lap of the modern era pull off the impossible—33 straight wins—a feat unlikely to ever be repeated.","popularity":0.2362,"poster_path":"/3tSy9iVXKnv6sQQZnwMLzs6M2nT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2024-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The fairytale you know.
