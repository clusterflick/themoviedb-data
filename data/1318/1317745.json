She was in her mid-seventies. Out of this came an important friendship. In 1966, I tried to film her—it was perhaps the second time that I had put a roll of film in the Bolex camera, and I was very nervous; part of the time I inadvertently left the lens cap on while filming. I was so disappointed that I threw the footage away except for two short film strips. Decades later, during the making of The Sparrow Dream, I re-filmed these two film strips on my editing table and objects associated with her, such as a wooden tray that she had carved. She was the first person to explain to me what an artist might be and in teaching me how to carve wood, I learned how to go with the grain or against it”","popularity":0.0661,"poster_path":"/yt29169yLUedaKxN7Oj6hp7RYRP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dedication: Bernice Hodges","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"6696f4023750e8465fcf1241","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cT9cf6oY1FItGvUqzblig6jNLHe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":975,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yt29169yLUedaKxN7Oj6hp7RYRP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"World premiere at The Roy and Niuta Titus Theater 2, Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY.
