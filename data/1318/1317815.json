But these ones have fur. Filming Dogs follows a small scruffy terrier called Ra as she attends an animal actor audition with three other dog actors. Ra is thirteen years old and is running out of time to realise the fame her human, the filmmaker, thinks she deserves. At its core, Filming Dogs explores the reasons for their humans seeking on-screen fame for their dogs and questions whether it is for us, for them, or for some other reason.","popularity":0.0658,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Filming Dogs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4833664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peta Hitchens","original_name":"Peta Hitchens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66971252024b7412961569ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3087972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madeleine Martiniello","original_name":"Madeleine Martiniello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66971263e43f538eccd172f1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4833665,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shannon Owen","original_name":"Shannon Owen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6697127abce143c82b1889dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4833664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peta Hitchens","original_name":"Peta Hitchens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66971286f69720a85145a971","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
