The film of the heart-breaking and hilarious new play about trust; remembering and forgetting to remember; loss; regret; love; pain and glory. Their lives took different paths; they are now reunited, but who is playing who? Are they who they say they are and should any of that matter? And once you've let go of your dreams, is there ever really any way back? It's about fathers and the shadows they leave, the labels we give to others and ourselves and the burden and guilt these two friends carry as a result. An achingly honest account that sees privilege and heroin joined at the hip.","popularity":0.5453,"poster_path":"/jw8H8aSIOok2Bqlj7Od1kJWMsc8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The film of the heart-breaking and hilarious new play about trust; remembering and forgetting to remember; loss; regret; love; pain and glory.","title":"The Twins","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371239,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ian Darling","original_name":"Ian Darling","popularity":0.1235,"profile_path":"/2hZgTb63l6jWdFaA4JOFQkTypYH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66975418148fa2bef581b719","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Fleet","original_name":"Greg Fleet","popularity":0.139,"profile_path":"/o6rMNgmyrVrYquv3hF0cttdknMa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6697543a6a22dd19ec8dd93f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Serio","original_name":"Terry Serio","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":"/o6lf5YvXubPRyU8ehbmhn4Kogae.jpg","credit_id":"669754bfa3ee3e8ab222e169","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4833988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Butler","original_name":"Sarah Butler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6697550f45d91dede0bcaa6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2030215,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mary Macrae","original_name":"Mary Macrae","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66975522ef615ae218ece730","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2320345,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ben Cunningham","original_name":"Ben Cunningham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669755459f823bea9748c612","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2314107,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sally Fryer","original_name":"Sally Fryer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669755315964bc148681b779","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15723002","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jw8H8aSIOok2Bqlj7Od1kJWMsc8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE TWINS","key":"nvijQ5K2yi0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-07-17T07:01:39.000Z","id":"66976d298361950e268a03ef"}]}}}
