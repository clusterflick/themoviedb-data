The villagers are convinced of foul play. For several years, there have been attempts by the authorities to get the villagers displaced in order to use their lands for setting up factories but they have been  offering a firm resistance, despite industrial wastes from a neighbouring industrial area affecting their fields. They are being led by a woman in her late 50s, Ayesha. Ayesha’s husband joined the insurgency in Assam several years ago and never returned. Despite him being gone for more than 3 decades, Ayesha hopes he’ll return one day. She promised to look after his village people in his absence. Ayesha, herself suffering from the disease, lives in a state where her memories and dreams are as real as her present. It’s as if she’s living different stages of her life simultaneously.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/OgObwIFQ2U5oM3po7Je75lHkvn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"He Used To Bring Me Apples","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4155165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mehdi Jahan","original_name":"Mehdi Jahan","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/iOrRPcb5CBGSoEw5Pal6XghseLO.jpg","credit_id":"66972acc663def9efacf25a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4155165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mehdi Jahan","original_name":"Mehdi Jahan","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/iOrRPcb5CBGSoEw5Pal6XghseLO.jpg","credit_id":"66972cb66ee53cbb4522de58","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zu7OGEzE1u0lC4vBY3vPuDgmmwJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/OgObwIFQ2U5oM3po7Je75lHkvn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
