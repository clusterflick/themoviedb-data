In this city where confusion and rebirth intersected, there were two legendary men who were known to everyone. They were Mitsugu Kano and Noboru Ando. Many people, including Ryu and Hoshiken of the Gurentai, admired these men who were not affiliated with any organization and lived proudly in their own way. Kano's reputation as a man who never used tools in a fight because of his extraordinary prowess, and who never turned tail when push came to shove, no matter who the opponent was, even reached the ears of Jihei Tsumura of the Tsumura-gumi, which was in charge of Shinjuku at the time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/iVFLaewJ1X6pqAq3PVPS4eiHBpc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Face of 'Juku","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iVFLaewJ1X6pqAq3PVPS4eiHBpc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1997-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
