The Australian scholar and security expert’s theories on the fallacy of nuclear action and his advice to the US Department of Defense played significant roles in the de-escalation of global conflict during the 1970s, while his investigation of controversial US military base Pine Gap during the 80s enraged ASIO – which kept a security file on him. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Ball offered guidance on signals intelligence in Burma and Thailand, and his work in East Timor gave the public a taste of secrets the government would prefer to remain hidden.","popularity":0.1364,"poster_path":"/l0oA8OeLGk4ySQUwLGhM9af38Iy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2024-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A gripping profile of Australian academic, agitator and surveillance expert Des Ball – the man who counselled the US against nuclear escalation in the 1970s.","title":"Twilight Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Hughes","original_name":"John Hughes","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b79dc847193c2930a8c9e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l0oA8OeLGk4ySQUwLGhM9af38Iy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antenna Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2025-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
