War rages between France and Germany. René, a young soldier, sent as a scout with two comrades, has the mission of warning the authorities of the advance of German troops. In the back, his wife, Brooke, waits tirelessly for his return, as guardian of the home.

Especially for René, the situation is becoming critical: the Germans are after them and he will soon have to obey the harsh law of military honor.","popularity":0.061,"poster_path":"/mslWR2HJAZLkPqlcN3ikL5vcgsk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'aube des mauvais jours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyril Boca","original_name":"Cyril Boca","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"René","credit_id":"669785f1df5933b81348c6ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Burger","original_name":"Michel Burger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Albert","credit_id":"66978622852a7d48dde1e8e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3227883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Dechanet","original_name":"Philippe Dechanet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Le sergent","credit_id":"66978634315767d6dbc11485","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agathe Jolivet","original_name":"Agathe Jolivet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Brooke","credit_id":"66978643a793460ff1e1e906","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2208742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Mathis","original_name":"Alexandre Mathis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6697868575297d5361ece8b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2208742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Mathis","original_name":"Alexandre Mathis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6697869046f991d9685081a3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14201102","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mslWR2HJAZLkPqlcN3ikL5vcgsk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
