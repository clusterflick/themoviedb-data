Los Williams / The Williams, a feature-length documentary, familiar and sporting, told in first-person by Iñaki and Nico Williams. Two brothers, footballers, Basques and \"beltzas\" or black, of Ghanaian descent, reveal their incredible tale across the two most crucial years of their lives. From their historic participation in the Qatar World Cup with two different selections, to the long-awaited victory of the Athletic Club in the Copa del Rey after 40 years, and Nico's triumph at the European Championship. Two international stars, face to face with their past and their future, through the conflicts that have marked their lives: racism, identity, frustration, ambition, and success.","popularity":1.9156,"poster_path":"/uPbR2w24s26nKET8yOeSY0elstU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72231,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kanaki Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":234030,"logo_path":null,"name":"En Cero Coma","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Williams","video":false,"vote_average":8.75,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2823758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iñaki Williams","original_name":"Iñaki Williams","popularity":0.1191,"profile_path":"/vo9k9YXQ3Q7RY8KHKdZtleq6g8L.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6696804edb9f74d2c1be7436","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2108696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nico Williams","original_name":"Nico Williams","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66968059ddf23dc6025dd14e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl de la Fuente","original_name":"Raúl de la Fuente","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":"/gml8Lxj3nNoo4Eh23TdDzD01h4O.jpg","credit_id":"6696801f107023b6c073b4b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2112999,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amaia Remírez","original_name":"Amaia Remírez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669680ef27a28a94cc096f1a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2112999,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amaia Remírez","original_name":"Amaia Remírez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669680f7bbcc5396bbdf8040","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4832778,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rosaura Romero","original_name":"Rosaura Romero","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66968116952ba9261a2760db","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4832779,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"María Recarte","original_name":"María Recarte","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66968128bc93142c65a38f5d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33034975","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/eLHSPJq77P0Mvmgv4JU4Ks0SaEE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/uPbR2w24s26nKET8yOeSY0elstU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13042,"name":"football (soccer)"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":200349,"name":"immigrant family"},{"id":262325,"name":"brothers"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
