Although his music career has spanned decades and continues to influence the Guam music scene, the film explores how his legacy has paved the way for younger artists to follow in his path. Together with rising local talents, Shannon McManus, John Glaser, and Andrew Gumataotao, they form the group, Tradewinds. Together the group produces music highly influenced in the jazz style with lyrics in the CHamoru language. Tradewinds is a film that highlights the importance of language preservation and explores the definition of indigenous
