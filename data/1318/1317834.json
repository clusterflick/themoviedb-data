As she balances denial and acceptance, she tries to \"hold on\" to her world through indulgence in sex and chocolate and consumption of material goods while trying to make peace with her father after years of self-imposed exile. Her father, a painter who never forgave Diane for going into the commercial art field, tries to welcome her back, but their personalities are on a crash collision course, and he is unable to be the willing ear for her secret, that she will soon die. The image of time slipping by is accentuated for Diane when she meets a wise clock-shop owner who rents her an apartment near her parents' house, while a mysterious angel, a cherubic little girl appears to Diane alone, calling her, inspiring her to paint a portrait of the angel and to face her destiny.","popularity":0.5511,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":234079,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crazed House Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angel's Tide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1768257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Bursiel","original_name":"Patricia Bursiel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Diane Collier","credit_id":"66971d19e061667e0dc10be6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Linville","original_name":"Larry Linville","popularity":0.2822,"profile_path":"/wiTdU3JFXFUX9PB74mtw7i0DxYU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ed Collier","credit_id":"66971d29ae9509fc777f0440","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Place","original_name":"Patricia Place","popularity":0.4545,"profile_path":"/2H0FuwxCV3xNF49t3q9AJJUwa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Anne Collier","credit_id":"66971d40448b0ccc55a9f401","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Gelman","original_name":"Larry Gelman","popularity":0.5618,"profile_path":"/aXEoXLxsqzizGhPM0D5pqTb5jjO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Al Steinberg","credit_id":"66971d5837e4c73a0489fdc8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3473959,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zeph E.
