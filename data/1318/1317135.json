In this country where Ali grew up, cultures and dialects intersect and blend, the scents of oriental spices rub shoulders with those of Italian tomato sauces, and in a quarter of an hour you get furious and then reconcile over a glass.  Ali... in the land of wonders is more than a succession of sketches: it is a true story - or an almost true story - filled with quirky, funny and touching characters, a contemporary fable.  After the success of his tour in France and at the Avignon Festival, Ali Bougheraba is back in Paris. Winner of the Jury Prize at the Vienne Comedy Festival 2012, the Audience Prize at the Villard de Lans Festival 2011 and the winner of the Factorire in 2009, Ali is a storyteller with a unique and unclassifiable humor.","popularity":0.1899,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":233923,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boni and Prod","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ali Bougheraba dans Ali au pays des merveilles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1914385,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ali Bougheraba","original_name":"Ali Bougheraba","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/vjoEnAOvwjPKSKFFJpd0ZdF2lj6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6695072a5eff8e15af7c2982","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1914385,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ali Bougheraba","original_name":"Ali Bougheraba","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/vjoEnAOvwjPKSKFFJpd0ZdF2lj6.jpg","credit_id":"66950739644bc9e832c98858","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1926738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didier Landucci","original_name":"Didier Landucci","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/7e291mBSbLKpwBxuVsQuNmE4Dmh.jpg","credit_id":"6695074b3e09024da97c2975","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":279602,"name":"marseille"},{"id":322268,"name":"comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
