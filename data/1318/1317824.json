In the sprawling expanse of Inwood Hill Park, that rhythm finds its heartbeat in Ranger Rocksy. As we navigate the leafy trails and spirited playgrounds of this urban oasis, \"Ranger Danger\" becomes more than just a tale of a ranger and her comedic recruits. It transforms into a reflection on responsibility, adaptability, and the unpredictable challenges city life can present. Ranger Rocksy, in her unwavering commitment to her park, finds herself facing not only overenthusiastic joggers and mistaken bird watchers but also the trials brought on by her latest—and perhaps most memorable—batch of recruits. The culmination of her famed Ranger In Training program, an exercise meant to teach crisis management in the most unconventional of ways, takes a turn that none could have anticipated, testing the mettle of our budding rangers and the very essence of what it means to be a guardian of the park.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/r9Y3xgT5G2L5gzbkyb1Rr4gzqMu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ranger Danger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4833705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Durán Grajewski","original_name":"Lauren Durán Grajewski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66971709d877b4ef1cc10d02","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4833706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Flynn","original_name":"Sam Flynn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6697171682a589a42d45ab5e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4833707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Rose","original_name":"Mike Rose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66971722943a13b456a9f1fb","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4833702,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Young","original_name":"Andrew Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669716e41e6600d7d8a9f275","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4833705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Durán Grajewski","original_name":"Lauren Durán Grajewski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669716feb8a658f1571569ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4833700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abigail Grubb","original_name":"Abigail Grubb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669716c9b0a510e99c89f992","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4833703,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachel Lipkin","original_name":"Rachel Lipkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669716f0b2e331181815b550","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r9Y3xgT5G2L5gzbkyb1Rr4gzqMu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
