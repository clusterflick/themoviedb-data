Along the way she experiences interactions with three different men. The first a middle-aged man who follows her from one stop to the next blatantly showing his true colors as a man intent on taking advantage of a woman alone. The second, a younger man, arrogant and brash who takes her disinterest for insult and a personal assault on his insecurities. The third and final interaction is with that of an Uber driver, whose wandering eyes and nuanced comments catch a girl in the most vulnerable of positions searching for an escape.","popularity":0.3356,"poster_path":"/7TAfj9dPGgwOITruKt01ehy0jyp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":234100,"logo_path":null,"name":"Espinosa Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A woman's mundane walk home morphs into a desperate, adrenaline pumping search for safety.","title":"How it Goes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3385910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Conner","original_name":"Lillian Conner","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/w4hpINA4CbOcNh48eAjj6qJhE6c.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lily","credit_id":"66975a5bd2f1f5d90c7f0d29","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2600450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jourdain Fisher","original_name":"Jourdain Fisher","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Hunter","credit_id":"66975a7045d91dede0bcaa9a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2864722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aristeo F.
