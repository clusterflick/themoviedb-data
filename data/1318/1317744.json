The parabolic shape of modern day radio telescopes—made to listen to signals emitted by celestial objects and events, and similarly the pyramidal shapes of ancient Mayan monoliths—where priests communed with forces beyond the human realm, can both be understood as ways of transiting into alternate universes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gB1k0mrzEiHzcSECE1AP3rffxIA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pyramids and Parabolas I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4833428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Wang","original_name":"Alice Wang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9WNWS8mkR8wfiGCTWsKu1s5UTXh.jpg","credit_id":"6696f4287bea3d36bd62ac79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":908,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gB1k0mrzEiHzcSECE1AP3rffxIA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":605}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
