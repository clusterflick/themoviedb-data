A group of huicholes wants a film made that portrays their religious and social customs, as they feel it is vital to preserve their culture for new generations. The huicholes are pilgrims, deer hunters, and they eat peyote. Every year, the Huicholes embark on pilgrimages from the mountain ranges in Jalisco to places like the Wirikuta Desert in San Luis Potosí and to the Aramara Sea along the coast of San Blas, Nayarit. The filmmakers were extended the rare opportunity to follow the Huicholes from San Jose and Tesorero on their travels and document their daily lives over a two-year period.","popularity":0.0641,"poster_path":"/m2VI2R5xRfP8AxHIpYNR518tZqA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flores en el desierto","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Bautista","original_name":"Francisco Bautista","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53714f51c3a368436600024d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Villa","original_name":"Pedro Villa","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53714f5fc3a368435f0001c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Bautista","original_name":"José Bautista","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"53714f6ac3a368435f0001c8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Carrillo","original_name":"Antonio Carrillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"53714f78c3a3684376000186","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joaquín Bautista","original_name":"Joaquín Bautista","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"53714ff6c3a368436e0001d4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrés Carrillo","original_name":"Andrés Carrillo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"53714ffec3a368436600025a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Álvarez","original_name":"José Álvarez","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53714f3bc3a36843580001a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1534420","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m2VI2R5xRfP8AxHIpYNR518tZqA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
