The way of crime is an easy way for them: a boy and a worker without a job or benefit are induced by 'el Señorito', the son of a rich lawyer. Together they form a band. Hard and violent, the film is made with a clear intention of social criticism and research of realism, culminating in a final scene that raised quite controversial.","popularity":0.3377,"poster_path":"/53hs7DCHQtbW6GstXH0nsS6mPyc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7866,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productores Exhibidores Films Sociedad Anónima
