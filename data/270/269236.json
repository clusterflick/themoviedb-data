While Nyombayire embarks upon this quest in an effort to uncover potential solutions for the ongoing genocide in Darfur and elsewhere, what emerges from their journey is more a testament to the ways in which the inherent good in the human spirit can trump institutional evil no matter what the circumstance.","popularity":0.0796,"poster_path":"/1oK9rWiwPu18D9JDrhRJHFJ3agR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rescuers","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Rescuers: Heroes of the Holocaust","type":"promotional title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael King","original_name":"Michael King","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536e9a010e0a2647d8010bc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107726,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roopesh Parekh","original_name":"Roopesh Parekh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/ldfC0xTcYVztjjr7TDaWfiEOGwO.jpg","credit_id":"67c398bf7053b95a73b474b3","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1346308","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jNKhtDOCaipgk3eISKXZTwPyKte.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1oK9rWiwPu18D9JDrhRJHFJ3agR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nNnmG7KrvUNgR5nw8KckLs3VHB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1424}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
