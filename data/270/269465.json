Manipulation and creating illusions is their profession. For them, the visual aspect of theater making is of great importance. These theater makers all have a special relationship with fine arts, they often use theater as a complement to express themselves. This form of theater has a great variety: from traditional to contemporary visual art events and everything in between. However, the starting point is always the same: bringing objects to life. By following theater makers with the camera - before, during and after the performance - we get to see things that otherwise we would never get to see: improvisations, dilemmas, the carpentry and construction. The film confronts the audience with the ingenuity of the performers and explores the genre through observation and dialogue.","popularity":0.0331,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moving Objects","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonard Retel Helmrich","original_name":"Leonard Retel Helmrich","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53707391c3a368121800f292","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0305843","wikidata_id":"Q2533253","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"a","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
