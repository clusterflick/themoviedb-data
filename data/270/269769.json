Raitburt’s The Kuleshov Effect, made about a year before Lev Kuleshov died, and interviewing him at length, both about his filmmaking and his far lengthier career as a teacher (including some fascinating remarks about Bertolt Brecht’s Galileo). Also interviewed is the father of Russian Formalism, Viktor Shklovsky, who worked with Kuleshov as a screenwriter on a Jack London adaptation, By the Law, in 1926.","popularity":0.0906,"poster_path":"/zmKn4B9hOL8rLxj0uRGH82iR79g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88367,"logo_path":"/8BGGqyuaxijzhqzmrgdCINWbPhj.png","name":"Tsentrnauchfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1969-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kuleshov Effect","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lev Kuleshov","original_name":"Лев Кулешов","popularity":0.143,"profile_path":"/9aTj5sZwTmdr60YkED4hwCdS6JZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"53736733c3a3681528001112","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1391344,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Viktor Shklovskiy","original_name":"Viktor Shklovskiy","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/qmxKtkTm2CvBPQYrURj4wiv5NKz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5dc88b54ab1bc7001505be6c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1786440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Semyon Raytburt","original_name":"Семен Райтбурт","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":"/ia0x9S76pj2PID7XfPIWqPAbz5q.jpg","credit_id":"6177db59924ce60043a174cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454410,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anatoliy Kaznin","original_name":"Anatoliy Kaznin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc88bb3fe077a0012522db8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454411,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"N.
