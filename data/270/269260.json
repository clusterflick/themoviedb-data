The place of recreation, however, is not chosen happily, due to lack of money: Gut Vorwald in the Sauerland region belongs to the mature nobleman Benno von Caldern, to whom Christina once pledged herself in her youth before meeting her future husband and renouncing Benno. Under the golden roof of autumnal oak crowns, the feelings of the past return, not without dramatic consequences.","popularity":0.5479,"poster_path":"/hU0XcvsnxtaIY4F8PmDVPyaUuao.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23150,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isar-Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Herbstromanze","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf
