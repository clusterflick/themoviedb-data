Upon learning that a local catskin dealer intends to buy up all the local felines, the boys organize a boycott against the man. It's a uphill climb, since the dealer has the law and the government on his side, having spread a rumor that the cats were diseased and needed to be killed off. Thanks to the boys, who aren't above a little larceny and duplicity themselves, the villain is foiled and the world made safe for meowers and mousers once more. Kampf der Tertia is based on a popular children's novel by Wilhelm Speyer.","popularity":0.165,"poster_path":"/eujErO5dodfYhStjl0raOEoP3NQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1952-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fight of the Tertia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1355728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Rau","original_name":"Brigitte Rau","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Daniela","credit_id":"5aff5d22c3a3687c5000017a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Jansen","original_name":"Wolfgang Jansen","popularity":0.1498,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Borst","credit_id":"5aff5d2dc3a3687c4a000275","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1336484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Weih","original_name":"Rolf Weih","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/fhR91EuPocIGkxvRRF4HPMJgiNQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr.Frey","credit_id":"5aff5d3b9251413667000206","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günther Jerschke","original_name":"Günther Jerschke","popularity":0.1955,"profile_path":"/qvZtVSK8pC0G8EHp7jSpPnatauP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr.Grau","credit_id":"5aff5d4d0e0a26302f0001b0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Brauer","original_name":"Charles Brauer","popularity":0.2354,"profile_path":"/pmzsKoimIu9ZaUfCyuJF1BJb0da.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tertianer","credit_id":"5aff5d5a925141366e0001aa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helmuth Rudolph","original_name":"Helmuth Rudolph","popularity":0.1068,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Schuldirektor","credit_id":"5c4a30280e0a26494fcfbff8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Ode","original_name":"Erik Ode","popularity":0.2292,"profile_path":"/m8eEq58jcPYL7bD7TaeDkYlKrmO.jpg","credit_id":"5aff5d12c3a3687c560001bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0263526","wikidata_id":"Q5447808","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eujErO5dodfYhStjl0raOEoP3NQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
