While the movement is known for Cesar Chavez’s leadership and considered a Chicano movement, Filipinos played a pivotal role. Filipino labor organizer, Larry Itliong, a cigar-chomping union veteran, organized a group of 1500 Filipinos to strike against the grape growers of Delano, California, beginning a collaboration between Filipinos, Chicanos and other ethnic workers that would go on for years.","popularity":0.9496,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Delano Manongs: Forgotten Heroes Of The United Farm Workers Movement","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2809223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Fabros","original_name":"Alex Fabros","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f805cbc02842000370b003c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2809224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Chavez","original_name":"Richard Chavez","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f805cce17505100379091eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1104731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolores Huerta","original_name":"Dolores Huerta","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f805cded8e15a003be3f8a5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2809225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Imutan","original_name":"Andy Imutan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f805cee175051003691cc5b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2809226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Itliong","original_name":"Johnny Itliong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f805cfb02842000380a2b21","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":123107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marissa Aroy","original_name":"Marissa Aroy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536ebef0c3a368121800d531","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":123107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marissa Aroy","original_name":"Marissa Aroy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f805c7f021cee00364e9af8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2370044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niall McKay","original_name":"Niall McKay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f805c9d2667780039b75f83","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2370044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niall McKay","original_name":"Niall McKay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f805d242667780038b32f99","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2809229,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lisa Whitmer","original_name":"Lisa Whitmer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f805d361750510038915554","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939508,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick August-Perna","original_name":"Nick August-Perna","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/tXeMcNYb3ntC1Esl23nzSH9wXcs.jpg","credit_id":"67eaa9022cca6fc8fbc70ac9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":159783,"name":"labor strike"},{"id":171584,"name":"filipino american"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
