Even after considerable torture and interrogation, the revolutionary maintains his silence as to the names of his accomplices. Soon he is killed, though no one seems to know who is responsible for his death. Four years later another regime has been established, and a former inmate of the dead revolutionary finds himself in a position of power. He now intends to find out who was responsible for the man's death. After this German tale first took the form of a radio play and then a stage production, character actor Peter Carsten decided to produce this film version.","popularity":0.1789,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1964-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Zeit der Schuldlosen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Schumann","original_name":"Erik Schumann","popularity":0.3441,"profile_path":"/lzfcODwRM4ekjnEf9KbSAZAl5SX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sason","credit_id":"536e1b380e0a2647cb010070","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Pasetti","original_name":"Peter Pasetti","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":"/Z8Jn8fltOSeIn8y9s7V9eh1XM7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Baron","credit_id":"536e1b440e0a2647ce00fa39","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Kieling","original_name":"Wolfgang Kieling","popularity":0.2163,"profile_path":"/fWjtjmyMOxXblncNwdqj7Lk1wtV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ingenieur","credit_id":"536e1b530e0a2647c4010349","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nino Korda","original_name":"Nino Korda","popularity":0.1292,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a6920269251414a1b00737b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1462352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Mosthav","original_name":"Franz Mosthav","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a69202e0e0a260d74007c59","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Reiser","original_name":"Hans Reiser","popularity":0.1405,"profile_path":"/ffJPdNiWWdoYcONX9FHi9RUKMOm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b0d7a6f9251417be500b5fd","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Fantl","original_name":"Thomas Fantl","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536d8f1d0e0a2647d800ec49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Fantl","original_name":"Thomas Fantl","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e033d3c0284200014b394a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271592,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Siegfried Lenz","original_name":"Siegfried Lenz","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e033d5c26dac1001268822b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0058769","wikidata_id":"Q179584","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
