She plays the daughter of an impoverished farmer with no way to pay his mounting debts except to sell her off to a wealthy landholder. Once in this new household, the unhappy daughter becomes a favorite of the master and thereby raises the green demon of jealousy in the heart of the dethroned favorite. The angry woman does her best to slander the newcomer out of her exalted position, and it almost works.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Slave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ubol Yugala","original_name":"Ubol Yugala","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5897380c92514129c80149a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0232148","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
