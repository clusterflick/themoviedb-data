The screen is broken up into eight more or less equal squares of which, at any one moment, a scene fragment may flickeringly appear in only one frame-corner at a time. As the film moves forward in time and patterns on screen become more complex, the viewer must choose what to focus on.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up, Down, Around","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
