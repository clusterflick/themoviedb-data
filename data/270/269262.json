One of the pugilists is a rookie on the rise and his sister has married the reigning champion. Now the champ is getting older and less able to hold his own against the newcomers -- including his brother-in-law. As his fortunes begin to decline, his wife whom he married while affluent is slowly forced to deal with the difficulties of poverty. This Italian drama was an entry in the 1959 Berlin Film Festival.","popularity":0.2247,"poster_path":"/eGUaVS5bq5XtAhjeC1MItsRjcjG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4843,"logo_path":null,"name":"Serena","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1959-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un uomo facile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurizio Arena","original_name":"Maurizio Arena","popularity":0.2319,"profile_path":"/zeaaWwwsKojZwKPwv8MlBrb6BxP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Romolo De Santis","credit_id":"5f8acec5eb79c200360a8876","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lello Bersani","original_name":"Lello Bersani","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Speaker television","credit_id":"5f8aced1d05a030035da60a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cathia Caro","original_name":"Cathia Caro","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/5z9aCPiti2EyEsc8ZX737pcot9q.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Giuditta","credit_id":"5f8acedbd05a030034da6080","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fosco Giachetti","original_name":"Fosco Giachetti","popularity":0.2878,"profile_path":"/o4d246ivltGB48HZ2706yNnm3hK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Doctor boxing","credit_id":"5f8acee4d05a030036da60bf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanna Ralli","original_name":"Giovanna Ralli","popularity":0.419,"profile_path":"/6dvHHF5JoFhQg6vD6rG8vyME4zK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lina","credit_id":"5f8acef11443f40039ccbef2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2818463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Grassi","original_name":"Alberto Grassi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Menicucci","credit_id":"5f8acf05f6fd180033b3c2fc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1020091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiberio Mitri","original_name":"Tiberio Mitri","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/kMl5R34wFlTJQJ8DAelfUQh3MN5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Enrico Costantini","credit_id":"5f8acf11e9da690037ed5a88","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giulio Calì","original_name":"Giulio Calì","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Gaetano","credit_id":"5f8acf19d05a030037da624f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1430285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erminio Spalla","original_name":"Erminio Spalla","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Coach","credit_id":"5f8acf2aefd3c20039380920","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fausto Tozzi","original_name":"Fausto Tozzi","popularity":0.1732,"profile_path":"/AkB0VBAL78vxLFXv3QPorMFsYYF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8acf33e9da690039e931c7","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paolo Heusch","original_name":"Paolo Heusch","popularity":0.1351,"profile_path":"/54869CqoNjtwbRCrHcircuyQzOC.jpg","credit_id":"536eca190e0a2647c801163f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":21233,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roberto Gerardi","original_name":"Roberto Gerardi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8acf60a13533003516e77f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fausto Tozzi","original_name":"Fausto Tozzi","popularity":0.1732,"profile_path":"/AkB0VBAL78vxLFXv3QPorMFsYYF.jpg","credit_id":"5f8acf48a13533003412e81a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29500,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlo Rustichelli","original_name":"Carlo Rustichelli","popularity":0.1444,"profile_path":"/uZyH8qIupMgsRErHN7RKuAActno.jpg","credit_id":"5f8acf56f6fd180033b3c468","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0052342","wikidata_id":"Q16954382","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":852,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/eGUaVS5bq5XtAhjeC1MItsRjcjG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":568}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
