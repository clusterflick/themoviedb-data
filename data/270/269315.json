They come across the Hunza, a people who live in the valley of the same name and believe they are descended from the soldiers of Alexander the Great. The documentary conveys impressions of the poor life of the Hunza people, the harvest, a court hearing, festivals and the children's everyday school life. Finally, the expedition sets off again and sets up its main camp on the moraine ridge of a glacier, where they measure the glacier and the earth's magnetic field. Finally, some men from the research community set off for a sub-peak of Batura.","popularity":0.7103,"poster_path":"/vhn7KunEajCOt7fFz0M86yORiBq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219758,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eugen Schuhmacher Produktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1955-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Shadow of Karakorum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Im Schatten des Karakorum – Durch das wilde Land der Hunza auf die Gipfel der Batura","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","title":"喜馬拉雅山探險","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Karakorumin varjossa","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Fritz Fürbringer","original_name":"Ernst Fritz Fürbringer","popularity":0.1689,"profile_path":"/2HMLUhELXPPF71vvDVbtjIv6dg5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self -
