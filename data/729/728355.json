As previously hinted at, the band submitted a plan to the festival's health and safety personnel, for a \"stunt\" involving a model UFO approaching the stage. This plan was rejected.  Bellamy wore red, Wolstenholme wore black and white and Dominic Howard wore a black shirt with blue trousers. Bellamy tossed his Manson Chrome Bomber across the stage at the end of Knights of Cydonia.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/evfFt2A8zHOhAsq9lSLLxxpIQFw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muse: Live at V Festival 2008","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g2x1smPB5Lg790JkWEsOeDTeixY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/evfFt2A8zHOhAsq9lSLLxxpIQFw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iOg2Ik39HyO5fVjBt4MGzHcO6uG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
