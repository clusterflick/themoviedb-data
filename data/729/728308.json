Rather than sit in an old broken down truck in the middle of nowhere while they wait for their friends to come pick them up, they decide to go with J (Violent J), a clown, who invites them to his bed and breakfast. However, J's ulterior motives are revealed when his retarded hunchback brother, Shaggy (Shaggy 2 Dope), decapitates one of the girls. The girl's friends head to pick them up, and each are murdered by the clowns.","popularity":0.3885,"poster_path":"/5jlAre5oX9n8ocBSs1xDVbczY3p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bowling Balls","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaggy 2 Dope","original_name":"Shaggy 2 Dope","popularity":0.1473,"profile_path":"/ibekMqg6oQrkveHaVIIiQfnDbe4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Shaggy","credit_id":"5f20ac57caaca20033628199","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violent J","original_name":"Violent J","popularity":0.208,"profile_path":"/b5jsTHyZx04gQ1UOSLykRFRgLLb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"J","credit_id":"5f20ac721a934f0038331ecb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1486660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Andresen","original_name":"Paul Andresen","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f20accd74d6c00038e8a185","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0431661","wikidata_id":"Q4951134","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ylMONo3f796iDEtb1m8ZPQ9soI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5jlAre5oX9n8ocBSs1xDVbczY3p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ytP91EzHIblxeOhLWKKpevz2GAL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
