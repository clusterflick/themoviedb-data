The venue was EMI's Abbey Road Studios.  Dan Newell, the band's live trumpeter, was drafted in for the first time at this performance. Matthew Bellamy can be seen playing/improvising a piece on the piano on video, which bears a slight resemblance to some of the piano work in Exogenesis: Symphony. It is pure speculation however whether this was one of the snippets of piano Bellamy used to put together the Symphony.  28th August 2006","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/o40W4No61vBZeG7oZRk4MVcOmp9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muse: Live at Abbey Road 2006","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4xp9iWLA6TPcB1QVb36fW7kPq5I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o40W4No61vBZeG7oZRk4MVcOmp9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
