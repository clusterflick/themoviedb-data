They want to change the system of scholastic education and the social situation in difficult regions. The school is a closed conservative world, where obedience and discipline are of the highest value. Young teachers discover that nationalism, sexism and homophobia are typical for their new environment. Children see the school as a prison and are completely indifferent to any new ideas. During one school year we observe attempts of our protagonists to bring new practices into the system. Young teachers try to speak with children about feminism, human rights and Russian politics, but the system pushes them out, and a comedy turns into a drama.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":"/sbcn1hBOwV8E3HIWPZkmcscVAMq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111158,"logo_path":"/9m4vqLnfjoPeyJteUmi2LZQDJ1c.png","name":"Current Time TV","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":142743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oka River","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hey!
