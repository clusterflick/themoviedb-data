The act of self-sacrifice for the sake of a child that absorbs all the time and leaves no space neither for consumption, nor for satisfactions or vanity, becomes a chance for a devoted woman in a state of the physical and emotional exhaustion to reach the transcendental state close to spiritual ecstasy. Lacking resources for a proper functioning, her organism starts disassociating information and enters into a seeming madness, when the brain is unable to control thought process as usual, and because of a total focus solely on a child, all the rest in the world ceases to be of any importance, freeing her from everything excessive and superfluous.","popularity":0.144,"poster_path":"/dLDm6Zb20w8A0HvqFo7YisPeA46.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maternity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2755851,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Khrystyna Savchuk","original_name":"Khrystyna Savchuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4691ead0b4340035175e12","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2755847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nataliya Ilchuk","original_name":"Nataliya Ilchuk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46912284448e0035d32d49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2755847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nataliya Ilchuk","original_name":"Nataliya Ilchuk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f469146511d090037c261dd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2755847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nataliya Ilchuk","original_name":"Nataliya Ilchuk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46916e8efe730034bbcff3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2755847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nataliya Ilchuk","original_name":"Nataliya Ilchuk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46918da8b2ca003887c533","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2755847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nataliya Ilchuk","original_name":"Nataliya Ilchuk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46919a17c44300359cf6f1","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2755851,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Khrystyna Savchuk","original_name":"Khrystyna Savchuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4691b3f6596f0040aa0225","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2755851,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Khrystyna Savchuk","original_name":"Khrystyna Savchuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4691d68efe730034bbd17c","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10777272","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.738,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dLDm6Zb20w8A0HvqFo7YisPeA46.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"(Exposition Panorama 21 at Le Fresnoy - Studio national des arts contemporains) ","release_date":"2019-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Ukrainian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Ukrainian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"uk\", \"native_name\"=>\"Ukrainian\"}","note":"Molodist","release_date":"2020-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
