The country has recently become independent, but it does not yet have clearly defined borders.  Back in Paris, Charles gets to report to the Conference of Ambassadors. At first, he is overwhelmed by the impressive architecture and the intimidating grandeur of the event. However, he soon learns that the party of self-serving diplomats has little interest in the future of the people he has just met. With no representative of Albania even present, Charles feels the need to speak up for the young country. Despite breaking protocol in doing so, Charles shares an observation with the quarrelling diplomats that allows them to find a peaceful solution to the question of where to draw the urgently needed borders.","popularity":0.1961,"poster_path":"/jIT4Uy3bYoKobMkhyXYbNtyJnKy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72129,"logo_path":null,"name":"Calach
