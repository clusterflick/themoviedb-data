Deliberately crude editing, with a \"bad feeling\" that the film causes, becomes \"their\" conceptual artistic act which directly questions the role of the Church and its influence on the modern world of globalization, new economies, technologies and mass alienation.","popularity":0.0908,"poster_path":"/8w1zpCdhLZLK7EgeFWQHqUH23Y8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137836,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art De Facto","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2006-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stupid Antonio Presents","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1311814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomislav Gotovac","original_name":"Tomislav Gotovac","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f20c52dcaaca20036626a63","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725478,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Darko Bavoljak","original_name":"Darko Bavoljak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f20c5495b2f4700364aed44","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725478,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Darko Bavoljak","original_name":"Darko Bavoljak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f20c554d4d509003717edfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2266841","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8w1zpCdhLZLK7EgeFWQHqUH23Y8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
