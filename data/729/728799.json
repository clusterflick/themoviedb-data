Public and private devotional life is represented by detailed visual narratives of the Chariot Journey of Krishna, celebrated by the whole town, and the Birthday Festival commemorated on a much smaller scale of intimate family worship.","popularity":0.114,"poster_path":"/3Gei3lx73nFYLbTOWoOTNKCM7iy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loving Krishna","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1135854,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Allen Moore","original_name":"Allen Moore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f23071aeea34d003835a48f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1862140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ákos Östör","original_name":"Ákos Östör","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f230648caaca20036676e48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Gei3lx73nFYLbTOWoOTNKCM7iy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
