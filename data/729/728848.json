The acceptance was based more on wartime-London's appreciation of the gallantry of Britain's sons and daughters from over the seas than it was on the artistic value of the show or the talent of the performers. The film is a fictional/fact mixture of the adventures of the troupe members, and the ending, only part filmed in Technicolor, is primarily the Revue as seen at the Hippodrome.","popularity":0.3517,"poster_path":"/y5hKiVvt0QEd0XFR5nzqAWU4sc9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14197,"logo_path":null,"name":"British National Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1946-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meet the Navy","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Murton","original_name":"Lionel Murton","popularity":0.1516,"profile_path":"/aGU7vs37UkQP10zj18JgASJlpJn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Johnny","credit_id":"5f22c6873503980033e307d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2726755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Hurst","original_name":"Margaret Hurst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Midge","credit_id":"5f22c6a1caaca2003373d27f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Pratt","original_name":"John Pratt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Horace","credit_id":"5f22c6d8eea34d00383517e0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Goodier","original_name":"Robert Goodier","popularity":0.1649,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tommy","credit_id":"5f22c6f1eea34d0037359ca4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2940233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phyllis Hudson","original_name":"Phyllis Hudson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jenny","credit_id":"60046799904f6d003fc45ceb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2940234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Percy Haynes","original_name":"Percy Haynes","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Cook","credit_id":"600467bbf6787a003e2f2717","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2940237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanette De Hueck","original_name":"Jeanette De Hueck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Gracie","credit_id":"60046808e8d0b4003d2c19f1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2940239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Natzke","original_name":"Oscar Natzke","popularity":0.0675,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Fisherman","credit_id":"6004681be8d0b4003d2c1a2d","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred Travers","original_name":"Alfred Travers","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f22c5b8caaca2003373c316","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132881,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lester Cooper","original_name":"Lester Cooper","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6004684563e6fb003f023a1c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2940243,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"J.P.
