However, as the minutes, hours and seconds count down, a creepy local legend about the black magic practicing Green Eyes that holds the town in it's grip, starts to become a horrifying reality... Combining the best elements of the cursed found footage genre with spellbinding pagan visuals, this is something of a dark fairytale for adults. Starring FrightFest favourites, presenter Emily Booth and HELLRAISER’s Nicholas Vince.","popularity":0.292,"poster_path":"/knOUXKocFNWQWQBl695JPWc458k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fear will find you.","title":"They're Outside","video":false,"vote_average":5.286,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2760940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Clayton-Wheatley","original_name":"Tom Clayton-Wheatley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Max Spencer","credit_id":"5f4c1fb412aabc0034a8409e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Randall","original_name":"Christine Randall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"61e5d3ccf5c824004294b10b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Miners","original_name":"Nicole Miners","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Nicole","credit_id":"61e5d38a904f6d008eab369f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2726580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Burdon-Sutton","original_name":"Emma Burdon-Sutton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sandra","credit_id":"5f22887e5b12400036252ad4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Booth","original_name":"Emily Booth","popularity":0.1941,"profile_path":"/8VVQuSZEtm0youm89VMFPoqwbZq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Penny","credit_id":"5f22884eedeb4300366f768d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Vince","original_name":"Nicholas Vince","popularity":0.1314,"profile_path":"/6Cy5ujCyB9oD1EMKcyhcNcAyW9v.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Richard","credit_id":"5f228868988afd003685508a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2315163,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rob Craine","original_name":"Rob Craine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Green Eyes","credit_id":"61e5d35f6aa8e0001c41c62a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2726579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Casserly","original_name":"Sam Casserly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2287ffedeb4300356f06b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675746,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Airell Anthony Hayles","original_name":"Airell Anthony Hayles","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f228821caaca200337019cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675746,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Airell Anthony Hayles","original_name":"Airell Anthony Hayles","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f22882b5b124000352cc2b1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9733886","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/knOUXKocFNWQWQBl695JPWc458k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":526}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10224,"name":"haunting"},{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"},{"id":9872,"name":"grief"},{"id":9955,"name":"urban legend"},{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"Frightfest - World Premiere","release_date":"2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
