This project is an artistic commentary on society while emphasizing the complexity of various individuals through the eyes of artists who evoke the Saint Laurent attitude of confidence, individuality and self-expression. The documentary is an exploration into the sources and personal history of creativity, the essential life of an artist. Raw and sharp, it has the feeling of a moment in time that is still happening. Abel Ferrara’s intimate and lush look at his own life, his world refracted through his art – music, filmmaking, his collaborators and inspirations such as Ferrara’s early works and his creative partnerships with Willem Dafoe, Joe Delia, Paul Hipp and the musicians who inspired this work.","popularity":0.5684,"poster_path":"/lhGoEMEAKmlVtjS0GlB4hf4WocG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80698,"logo_path":"/w4qRoVIvXPdrOpNMr6dQ8U2CR3.png","name":"Vixens","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":139679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rimsky
