And it’s a melancholy meditation on the stuff of days, the flesh of the future, on irretrievable erasure and the traces waiting and hoping to be saved.","popularity":0.084,"poster_path":"/hyqcR7CcXiBZLIkZLKndzxQyNEE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137835,"logo_path":null,"name":"HORIZON INVERSE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Northern Range","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2666609,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sébastien Descoins","original_name":"Sébastien Descoins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bf88359f37b001635bd23d","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2028244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léo Richard","original_name":"Léo Richard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f20c48a56b9f70036121f51","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1750323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Sabatelli","original_name":"Anne Sabatelli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f20c498caaca20036626954","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1795997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivier Derousseau","original_name":"Olivier Derousseau","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f20c46956b9f70036121eac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1795997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivier Derousseau","original_name":"Olivier Derousseau","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f20c47822df2e0035c35af7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13249742","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mY5eQF8FkfECUI9tMHocxoD2LU4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hyqcR7CcXiBZLIkZLKndzxQyNEE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
