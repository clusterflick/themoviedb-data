Whilst it is not unusual to hear Rumba drifting from back alleys in Havana, Rumba Morena is different - they are all women. Cuban Rumba is traditionally played by men only, and Rumba Morena breaks the mould. Uproar explores the complex intersection of religion, music and gender dynamics of Rumba Morena – and the roots influencing the male resistance to it.The film aims to peer under the skin of the complex intersection of religion, music and gender dynamics affecting the circumstances around Rumba Morena and explore the roots influencing the male resistance to Rumba Morena’s music.","popularity":0.1966,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uproar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2241753,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sebastian Cort","original_name":"Sebastian Cort","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f214563e942ee003656f7bc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72622,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matt Cooper","original_name":"Matt Cooper","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f21459bcaaca20036635606","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12234,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nigel Sinclair","original_name":"Nigel Sinclair","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f21462017c443003a991cf2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":563584,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Rosenberg","original_name":"Robert Rosenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f214649caaca2003365e969","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725772,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Georgia Woolley","original_name":"Georgia Woolley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2145ecdf857c0036d37cb2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moe Najati","original_name":"Moe Najati","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f21454817c44300389881bc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moe Najati","original_name":"Moe Najati","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f21455256b9f7003614e650","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moe Najati","original_name":"Moe Najati","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f21453017c4430038988196","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11657942","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"Sheffield Doc/Fest virtual festival","release_date":"2020-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
