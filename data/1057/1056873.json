During a pursuit between the car driven by one and the motorcycle of the other, an accident occurs; the motorcycle skids and its driver is killed. Karl, the survivor, begins to remember: their tennis games, their mutual friend, their games, their lessons, their holidays and their discussions. The film intersects all these memories to try to identify the deep friendship that bound the two teenagers and takes place in the present of Karl and the friend and in the past of memory. After having done everything to find his friend, even going so far as to dig him up in the cemetery in the middle of winter, Karl, appalled by his \"murder\", becomes more and more schizophrenic. He enters the hospital and stays there until the end of his days, fixated on this accident which turned his life upside down.","popularity":0.068,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinak Compagnie Cinématographique","origin_country":""},{"id":20217,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société de Développement de l'Industrie Cinématographique Canadienne","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Corps et âme","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3814496,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-Louis Longtin","original_name":"Jean-Louis Longtin","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638c1a88420228009f8ae23d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2384004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Audy","original_name":"Michel Audy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638c1a6b8d77c400b80ea394","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194592,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"André-Luc Dupont","original_name":"André-Luc Dupont","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638c1aa00e64af00deab1ff1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3814487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Thompson","original_name":"Paul Thompson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638c1ab68a84d200c9c9af03","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1303576,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marguerite Duparc","original_name":"Marguerite Duparc","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638c1ae8c3aa3f007a111c92","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2384004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Audy","original_name":"Michel Audy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638c1a9015376c00c8357411","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2384004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Audy","original_name":"Michel Audy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638c1ac3c3aa3f0084cce719","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0269113","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
