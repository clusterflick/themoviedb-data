It is a set of vignettes, cinematographic tableaux, built around the repeated gestures of my parents' daily life. I present these scenes sometimes as sequence shots, sometimes as a succession of cut-out shots. Some depict only one parent, with particular emphasis on how he/she negotiates domestic space. With these paintings, imagined in various environments and by a treatment specific to the medium, I work to reveal the singularity of the places, the movement of the figures and the relationship between the two.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/o4UnWiyrt0U3pa41Zb9KZuVKAKO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95412,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'Abominable","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Larose","original_name":"Alexandre Larose","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/9LxhUOjLRPrtnAchEfHJx1NIFAX.jpg","credit_id":"638a7de68a84d2008c4b3ddd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o4UnWiyrt0U3pa41Zb9KZuVKAKO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"S8 Mostra de Cinema Periférico","release_date":"2022-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
