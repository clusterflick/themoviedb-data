Spanning six screens that encircle the room, the installation surrounds viewers with a performance of spatial music written for eight dancers with eight guitars. Recorded from the center of the performers’ space, the installation is kaleidoscopic, capturing the dancers as they weave within each screen and across the channels; their movements and melodies ranging from pastorale to rock and roll. Combining a variety of classic Western references – blue jeans and white t-shirts, the draped silk curtains of mid-20th century song and dance films, as well as lyrics drawn from the Archaic Greek poet Sappho and adventurer Vivant Denon, two sensualists millennia apart – the work spins notions of idealization and iconography.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/y8du2R31YvRNL0Y6gOb4KOAEF3k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134087,"logo_path":null,"name":"Luhring Augustine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ragnar Kjartansson","original_name":"Ragnar Kjartansson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638a57758a84d20084789207","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1253,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y8du2R31YvRNL0Y6gOb4KOAEF3k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":835}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
