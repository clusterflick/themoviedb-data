Portrait of an actor, Sardinian by birth but Sicilian, in pure stereotyped version, on screen. An authentic forgery invented by Monicelli, Murgia became a mask of Italian Comedy. Thoughts and words, memories, regrets and lies of an actor much loved by the public, with the counterpoint of the comments of his colleagues, critics, family and friends. In the background, the parable of an Italian who was both saved and dazzled by the cinema and the boom years of the 1960s.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1TouVbMsDbzq0mPr9gy5y3Y1Wh8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'insolito ignoto - Vita acrobatica di Tiberio Murgia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2528244","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1TouVbMsDbzq0mPr9gy5y3Y1Wh8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
