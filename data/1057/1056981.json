The film is propelled by a performer who lip-syncs to melodramatic songs, immersed in otherworldly make-ups and hyperreal images of Korean landscapes. The lyrics adapt wordplay and self-loathing satire with wry humour, reflecting the irony of living in a society built upon the histories of colonialism and the cold war. From a Korean patriotic tune lamenting an ill-fated love for a country to a children’s song set in a sci-fi dystopia, the film composes an anthem of a neocolony.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/762RPkeaywbSLegX0oyJeAu2LQm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viral Lingua","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1910580,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lee Min-whee","original_name":"Lee Min-whee","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/csSFAwzc0ilyXxEZZRYpmWGEKEj.jpg","credit_id":"638c7b177d5db50fc7f71ab9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yun Choi","original_name":"Yun Choi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638c7a8fc3aa3f007f35997f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1910580,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lee Min-whee","original_name":"Lee Min-whee","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/csSFAwzc0ilyXxEZZRYpmWGEKEj.jpg","credit_id":"638c7b07c3aa3f0084cd0e54","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yun Choi","original_name":"Yun Choi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638c7b300e64af00c25df578","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/762RPkeaywbSLegX0oyJeAu2LQm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
