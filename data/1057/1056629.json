Although that memory is involuntary, it is materialized in the letters: fragments and scraps of a relationship that was once desire and that remains unfinished. The voices detach themselves from the letters but they inhabit another indefinite space-time, and that capricious dialogue seems to reveal the unspoken question: where does end up that we were in a longed-for memory? Where is that piece of identity confined, alien, dissimilar, but always close and latent?  Las cartas is born from an arbitrary discovery: photos, letters, files that are dusted off old boxes. From that moment on, the objects (which were once experiences) become the repetition of a happy or turbulent memory. That crisis, that intrinsic tension, is sought to be captured through an off recording and a visual montage.","popularity":0.1633,"poster_path":"/3C9w58SlzmZ0c05CaktzcMrH6OB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las cartas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Velis","original_name":"Juan Velis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"638b59dc8a84d20079af5f93","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Casiopes García Abuin","original_name":"Casiopes García Abuin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"638b5a200e64af00deaad8d8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Velis","original_name":"Juan Velis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638b5985c3aa3f0084cc9c9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2887874,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ignacio Dalto","original_name":"Ignacio Dalto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638b59b9c3aa3f007a10d8e4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813504,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manuel Ferrin","original_name":"Manuel Ferrin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638b59a2c3aa3f00c89c35b5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1349,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3C9w58SlzmZ0c05CaktzcMrH6OB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3344,"name":"letter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Las Cartas (2021) - Cortometraje","key":"6x5Fjnlrvac","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2022-12-02T19:27:03.000Z","id":"638b5a7615376c00865ae77f"}]}}}
