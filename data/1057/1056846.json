The film cuts between three related narratives: a film collective on a journey to find a mysterious film theorist/filmmaker; a couple whose relationship is falling apart as they each work on pieces concerning the cinematic past and the cinematic present; and two cinematic radicals holed up in an unknown location trying to understand how to revolutionize cinema.","popularity":0.0664,"poster_path":"/ghhY6WUZYGojdyFfuYC0Vhg0Vtg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Episodes
