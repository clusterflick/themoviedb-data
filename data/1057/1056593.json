Captive of this impossible love, the young girl is dying of melancholy. But the constancy of her love is stronger than death; she wins the pity of the judge of the underworld, manages to find her lover and come back to life.  The opera \"The Peony Pavilion\" was composed in 1598 by the poet Tang Xianzu (1550-1617), one of the greatest playwrights of the Ming period. Of all the forms of Chinese opera that have followed one another since the 12th century, the kunqu is the one that best preserves the image of a classical art highly appreciated in educated circles for its musical, literary and gestural refinement.","popularity":0.0875,"poster_path":"/mFTeEdgyrAjH4TN5Wo3R8GjqZfE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Peony Pavilion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le Pavillon aux pivoines","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Mu Dan TIng","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Noël Sissia","original_name":"Jean-Noël Sissia","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/cpSSyfQnvcAuTMwCe7XJ1uRjJuM.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"638b418615376c00c835228e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Mazars","original_name":"Alain Mazars","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/AgTVBzaBxnGftRGw9lFGVsmUnrJ.jpg","credit_id":"638b40fc15376c007b37598e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"N.T.
