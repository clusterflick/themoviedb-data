The film puts the cleaners Mavis Adu-Gyamfi und Kosmas Gavranidis in the center of attention: it looks over their shoulder at their work and lets them speak.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hardly noticed, cleaning staff at the art academy mop and scrub the corridors and rooms, five days a week.","title":"Mavis and Kosmas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mavis Adu-Gyamfi","original_name":"Mavis Adu-Gyamfi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Cleaner","credit_id":"638b7fe58d77c4009899f3d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kosmas Gavranidis","original_name":"Kosmas Gavranidis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Cleaner","credit_id":"638b7ff78d77c40086b0b6b4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zauri Matikashvili","original_name":"Zauri Matikashvili","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638b8081c3aa3f0096e20e8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zauri Matikashvili","original_name":"Zauri Matikashvili","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638b808e420228009f8aa527","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zauri Matikashvili","original_name":"Zauri Matikashvili","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638b80af4202280086ce1e23","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813725,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Katharina  Siemeling","original_name":"Katharina  Siemeling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638b80cb1283e9009766a2a3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
