They're especially close because though she looks young, Rebecca has rheumatoid arthritis, which severely limits the use of her hands. Ainsley has to help her mom with many daily tasks, like buttoning up her shirt, and Rebecca can't do a lot of things for or with Ainsley.  Sometimes Ainsley struggles with feeling different, but she tries to keep her feelings hidden from her mother. And together both try to live as normal of a life as possible. But when Rebecca and Ainsley face some prejudice and lack of understanding at the grocery store from someone who can't believe Rebecca has a physical disability, the pair learn to accept and stand up for themselves together.","popularity":0.0893,"poster_path":"/wAxEr8m5LamIU93N3pJrhq1y4xO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revenge Of The Electric Cart","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3812261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Galletta","original_name":"Ashley Galletta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ainsley","credit_id":"638a3d9ed2f5b500c889aca3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3812262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Shafer","original_name":"Amanda Shafer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rebecca","credit_id":"638a3db070b444008c52b238","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3812260,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rikki Stinnette","original_name":"Rikki Stinnette","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638a3d6270b444008c52b206","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3812260,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rikki Stinnette","original_name":"Rikki Stinnette","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638a3d6c1b722c00c16bb486","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":834,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wAxEr8m5LamIU93N3pJrhq1y4xO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":556}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Omeleto","release_date":"2022-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
