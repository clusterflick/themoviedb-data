Recorded in 1980 at a studio out on Long Island, Meredith is in full voice, relaxed and creatively inspired by a small audience of Monk cogniscenti. Recorded with a 3-camera shoot and then put on the shelf, Tzadik is proud to present the first release of this astonishing virtuoso solo performance. Featuring acappella compositions as well as pieces where she accompanies herself on the piano, this is an intimate view of this remarkable and sensitive Renaissance woman.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/aDivAdj4Z9cofgPm7ekyKQW47WI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20099,"logo_path":"/aFTLUTK0jcHgUbKPyQhrI9yyxMk.png","name":"Tzadik","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meredith Monk: Solo Concert 1980","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1303053,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Meredith Monk","original_name":"Meredith Monk","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"638a033c70b44400de452d9a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1303053,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Meredith Monk","original_name":"Meredith Monk","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638a03575690b5007cffc110","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3811882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Rothbard","original_name":"Michael Rothbard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638a036570b4440079374495","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3811882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Rothbard","original_name":"Michael Rothbard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638a0377f3b49a00842e2e9e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3811882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Rothbard","original_name":"Michael Rothbard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638a03865690b500b82fec34","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3610754,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Sciscioli","original_name":"Peter Sciscioli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638a038f70b44400793744a5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1303053,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Meredith Monk","original_name":"Meredith Monk","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638a039d5690b500837f1f94","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2632235,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Grenadier","original_name":"Michael Grenadier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638a03a21b722c008ed3d82a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aDivAdj4Z9cofgPm7ekyKQW47WI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
