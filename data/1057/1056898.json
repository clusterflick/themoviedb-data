After failing to qualify for the 2016 Olympics, they set a shared goal, the 2020 Olympics. Not too long after, their esteemed coach Natalie is fired by the federation with no explanation. What follows is an emotional devastation and disruption of scheduled practices, which in turn leads to a decline in their performances. Political tremors in Turkey and the global pandemic lead the duet to make a decision on whether to keep the fight or to find new paths in life.","popularity":0.6795,"poster_path":"/psZhnc3DUYsMPhkG0H6aIqdfH6n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196695,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pablo
