Told by the First Nations Elders and Leaders of the boreal, leading scientists and activists, The Issue with Tissue creates a kind of talking circle that inspires our storytellers to speak with intimacy and candor about the issues confronting us all, sharing their enlightened, unified vision that the way forward lies in supporting and elevating Indigenous knowledge/stewardship in combination with the ages old wisdom that can be found in the life of these forests and trees.","popularity":0.2721,"poster_path":"/jLHnvuRepqDoa5yG9i4YfbER5A5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Issue with Tissue: A Boreal Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3922319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valérie Courtois","original_name":"Valérie Courtois","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63ed70008e8702009ec270ba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Zelniker","original_name":"Michael Zelniker","popularity":0.234,"profile_path":"/7iYCoX0uxAS3ROguA3pXoqiiaNA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63ed6fe6f92532009d9348d4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3922320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Courchene","original_name":"Dave Courchene","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63ed703a813cb6007942e917","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1664900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Audette","original_name":"Michèle Audette","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/d6mo6mmo4OjnOjN0WbAmD2QmwAa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63ed705bf9253200c3003f0f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3845410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Porter","original_name":"Dave Porter","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63ed70908e870200a989ef2f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1738325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Simard","original_name":"Suzanne Simard","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63ed70a71b7294008e1687d0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3922321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen J.
