Questioning the fast cycle of cultural production, Choi recycles her exhibition into a context and material for a shapeshifting film in which a group of performers play the spirit medium of the unattended. The resulting film enacts trance like rituals – a dramatic monologue, ghostly rave party and wistful self-affirmation – with an animistic imagination. Colliding references to the horror genre with pop spiritualism, Choi choreographs feelings of disillusionment induced by the pressure to constantly “upload” and “update”.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/sUP1DUG7HWyc0p2tBrQHSLSSOzO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where the Heart Goes_Poetry Collection","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yun Choi","original_name":"Yun Choi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638c7d2515376c3daaf9203f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sUP1DUG7HWyc0p2tBrQHSLSSOzO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
