With honour at risk, social status bartered and happiness illusive, the Marschallin accepts time cannot be stopped and she must set young love free.  After opening the 2022-23 season in Brussels with Pikovaya Dama, La Monnaie / De Munt now streams Der Rosenkavalier live on OperaVision. The mystery of time resonates throughout Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s highly spiritual and nostalgic libretto, for which Richard Strauss took a step back in time to eighteenth-century Vienna. Waltzing in neoclassical style, with sublime lyricism and a refined orchestral palette, the opera looks back to the past, faded beauty, lost loves.","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":"/u52H5FRQ93Z6JNiAYzZ2PrK0mdb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Rosenkavalier - La Monnaie / De Munt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1109275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Matthews","original_name":"Sally Matthews","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"638c8ca71283e900a8a36a9c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2196747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Winkler","original_name":"Martin Winkler","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"638c8cb00e64af00c25dfcee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Losier","original_name":"Michèle Losier","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/gxshJndUkEHCkb4r6a23PcWvn4F.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"638c8cbaab5e340079182ac9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dietrich Henschel","original_name":"Dietrich Henschel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rlXUPs1jN95EmipMvhHexaqKG7s.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"638c8cc1ab5e3400af7b3252","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2292970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilse Eerens","original_name":"Ilse Eerens","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"638c8cc90e64af007e862cde","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3814892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabine Hogrefe","original_name":"Sabine Hogrefe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"638c8cd2ab5e34008450071a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damiano Michieletto","original_name":"Damiano Michieletto","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638c8ce10e64af008859c36c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Altinoglu","original_name":"Alain Altinoglu","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638c8cf18d77c40086b126be","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u52H5FRQ93Z6JNiAYzZ2PrK0mdb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
