Some sequences of this film depict struggle of white blood cells with black bacteria, which, like an organized army, penetrate the body through damaged teeth. Some solutions for this film were made largely under the direct influence of Walt Disney’s film Vaccination, which features quite a few similar scenes. Naši zubi has had great success with young audiences because of its cartoonish charms, which was achieved without neglecting the basic, educational goal.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rXmneBoEUD8QpuzV9QvLYhzQ5nn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":191585,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nastavni film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Teeth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","title":"naši zubi (fragmenti)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"YU","title":"naši zubi (fragments)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3814632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stjepan Velić","original_name":"Stjepan Velić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638c587e7d5db50fbf00cedc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3886013,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bogoslav Petanjek","original_name":"Bogoslav Petanjek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cd6437d363e5009d688882","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3886011,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Miroslav Bobuš","original_name":"Miroslav Bobuš","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cd6426336e01007c5fd7e8","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3886009,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Zdravko Mihelčić","original_name":"Zdravko Mihelčić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cd6411d363e5009d688874","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rXmneBoEUD8QpuzV9QvLYhzQ5nn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
