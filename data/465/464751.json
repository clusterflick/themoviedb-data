Drew begins his journey as a lazy worthless shell of a man but through physical fitness and extreme dedication Drew is able to build a new, more powerful self.  Invincible Force was made with a budget of zero using only equipment, media, props, wardrobe and locations that were found, borrowed or stolen. Invincible Force was carefully scripted and stylized but the stunning transformation of body and character it captures is entirely real.","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":"/o4XuWnZPPTJP3RAMfEKqg3uYtct.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":131,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"survival of the fittest.","title":"Invincible Force","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1845443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Ailes","original_name":"Drew Ailes","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Drew","credit_id":"595d31259251410bfa078ca8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1845444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anissa Siobhan Brazill","original_name":"Anissa Siobhan Brazill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Amber","credit_id":"595d3146c3a368265d07284e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1845445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Schneidkraut","original_name":"Daniel Schneidkraut","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595d316e925141222b059bbe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1854294","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8xJOQMvzd0ke9ahxsRRM76xclqf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/o4XuWnZPPTJP3RAMfEKqg3uYtct.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
