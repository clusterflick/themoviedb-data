On an emotional support crusade - the kind only older sisters can supply - straight-laced Clare and new age hipster Grace breeze in to help him get it together. Wine is drunk, weed is smoked, and an old family tradition is resurrected. All that's left is for Harry to do something about the giant slug he's hiding in the caravan out front.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2015-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everybody has one","title":"Slug","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1844432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone French","original_name":"Simone French","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Clare","credit_id":"595b4e52925141222b035381","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1844433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Forbes","original_name":"Ryan Forbes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"595b4e5c9251410c5604d7ec","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1844434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cariad Wallace","original_name":"Cariad Wallace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Grace","credit_id":"595b4e669251410b860521ec","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1844435,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick McBain","original_name":"Patrick McBain","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595b4e7d92514121f0035668","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1844435,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick McBain","original_name":"Patrick McBain","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595b4e84c3a3680dec0222a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1844436,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emma Roberts","original_name":"Emma Roberts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595b4ea7c3a36828a105b5bc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5565480","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
