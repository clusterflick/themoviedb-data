This method of threading is used in Iranian culture and it has been a part of my upbringing since a young age. It is also a female bonding ritual, one in which I share with the women in my life and it is typically performed in a private space. This space is commonly reserved for story sharing and dialogue. I attempt to bring the viewer into intimate contact with acts that are usually performed in private; I attempt to create feelings of closeness and familiarity. My performance becomes an offer of intimacy and access.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sound of Strings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1843559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rah Eleh","original_name":"Rah Eleh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59596e9992514121f000f917","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
