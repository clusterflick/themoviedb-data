Why have sex and religion come to replace the plague as our number one collective fear? Set in a folkloristic alpine background, Les contagions barbares is a whirlwind of questions that a child might ask. Through a melting pot of images and video extracts, folk music, medieval archives and handmade drawings, the childlike voiceover narrator embarks us on a journey where gender, sexuality and systemic violence collide with history, tradition, family taboos and even a Bobsleigh race.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Barbarian Contagions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1843561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Dauverné","original_name":"Marie Dauverné","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59596f539251410a5902ae43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
