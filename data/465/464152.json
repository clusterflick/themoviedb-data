In Ecuador, an uncontacted tribe called the Tageari are next in the firing line and when contact occurs, their health, their faith, their environment, their love - all the things that define their culture - are changed forever. AMAZON - THE INVISIBLE PEOPLE traces the work of an Australian, Doug Ferguson, who went to Ecuador in 1986 to work with Indigenous people. He married a shaman's daughter, fathered two children and built a rainforest home. Doug has helped three tribes secure and demark their ancestoral land, saved more than a million hectares of pristine rainforest in reserves and National Parks, and established sustainable agricultural projects in a nation devastated by slash and burn agriculture. This is the story of Doug Ferguson's work.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bDWZluZD3BQUz1nRGe8nOK2GXo7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amazon: The Invisible People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1842418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Ferguson","original_name":"Douglas Ferguson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5957dcdd9251410b8600ed65","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Balson","original_name":"Michael Balson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5957dc44925141088300e8d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382474,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dean Jefferys","original_name":"Dean Jefferys","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5957dc50c3a36825e800d84c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bDWZluZD3BQUz1nRGe8nOK2GXo7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":510}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
