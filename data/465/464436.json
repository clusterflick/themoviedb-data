Director Todd, a Metis, introduces Edmonton elders Ann Anderson, Eva Cardinal, and Olive Dickason, remarkable educators who are working with younger natives. They recount harrowing experiences at reservation schools, memories which fuelled their determination to preserve their language and identities. Using a unique blend of documentary footage, dramatic re-enactments, and archival film, Todd weaves together the life stories of three unsung heroines who are making education relevant in today's native communities.","popularity":0.0566,"poster_path":"/cbpab4UXK3Ce7UL8ZKg8jrCamqH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tamarack Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1991-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Learning Path","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1118087,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Cullingham","original_name":"James Cullingham","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595a57969251410a5903cff6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Raymont","original_name":"Peter Raymont","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595a57a3c3a368265d03c5e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1843911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Loretta Todd","original_name":"Loretta Todd","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595a578d9251410b8603e2fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0226939","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cbpab4UXK3Ce7UL8ZKg8jrCamqH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
