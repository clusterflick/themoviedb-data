Images and representations of two structures in the Portland Metropolitan Area that have direct and complicated connections to the Chinookan people who inhabit(ed) the land are woven with audio tapes of one of the last speakers of chinuk wawa, the Chinookan creole. These localities of matter resist their reduction into objects, and call anew for space and time given to wandering as a deliberate act, and the empowerment of shared utility.","popularity":0.5293,"poster_path":"/aQRTeAauk3YWlhOsflWLsV48uEu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anti-Objects, or Space Without Path or Boundary","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3216647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Archuleta","original_name":"Greg Archuleta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"612c6566a135330042135a09","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3216648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilson Bobb","original_name":"Wilson Bobb","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"612c656d06f984008eb99ef9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2481766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sweetwater Sahme","original_name":"Sweetwater Sahme","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"612c6574d04d1a004439a9ca","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3216649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Zenk","original_name":"Henry Zenk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"612c657a42f19f00429fc76e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sky Hopinka","original_name":"Sky Hopinka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hYPYrwtFcrvgWXKT4AJBBW0eAi0.jpg","credit_id":"612c658f42f19f0066afef87","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sky Hopinka","original_name":"Sky Hopinka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hYPYrwtFcrvgWXKT4AJBBW0eAi0.jpg","credit_id":"595ec9e29251412251073e5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sky Hopinka","original_name":"Sky Hopinka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hYPYrwtFcrvgWXKT4AJBBW0eAi0.jpg","credit_id":"595ec9f79251412251073e69","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sky Hopinka","original_name":"Sky Hopinka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hYPYrwtFcrvgWXKT4AJBBW0eAi0.jpg","credit_id":"595eca17c3a368253c082bd0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15406352","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.552,"height":1622,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aQRTeAauk3YWlhOsflWLsV48uEu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":896},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ng37ATPxmGXWoowvT4C7XhgJLuU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":10322,"name":"native american"},{"id":1897,"name":"oregon, usa"},{"id":238772,"name":"chinook"},{"id":240834,"name":"washington"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Images Festival","release_date":"2020-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2018-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
