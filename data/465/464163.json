Due to childhood malnutrition causing bone problems in her teen years, she was forced to give up the violin and moved to New York City in the mid 1920's where she met and became involved with Russian electronics genius Leon Theremin and helped him to refine and perfect his new instrument, giving advice from the standpoint of a musical performer to make the theremin more playable and developing her own hand techniques and exercises for playing the instrument.","popularity":0.4693,"poster_path":"/dmC6fXtowv4eIl2N41e5BfA67hv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big Briar, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clara Rockmore: The Greatest Theremin Virtuosa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Clara Rockmore: The World's Greatest Theremin Virtuosa","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1842466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Rockmore","original_name":"Clara Rockmore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self - Performer, Theremin","credit_id":"5957e5609251410bfa00f3b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4102435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadia Reisenberg","original_name":"Nadia Reisenberg","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Performer, Piano","credit_id":"648166ae99259c00accb13a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1842442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Moog","original_name":"Robert Moog","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Round Table Discussion","credit_id":"5957e58dc3a368275000d24d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4418245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Rhea","original_name":"Thomas Rhea","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Round Table Discussion","credit_id":"65720bceae6f09011d566b53","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2112464,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Sherman","original_name":"Robert Sherman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Round Table Discussion","credit_id":"65720bf9dfe31d00c3ce29cb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25212,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ralf D.
