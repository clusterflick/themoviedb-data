Unlike the Chinese and the Japanese, people from British India were excluded by a regulation that appeared fair, but in reality, was an effective way of keeping people from India out of Canada until 1948. As a direct result, only a half-mile from Canadian shores, the Komagata Maru was surrounded by immigration boats and the passengers were held incommunicado virtual prisoners on the ship. Thus began a dramatic stand-off which would escalate over the course of two months, becoming one of the most infamous incidents in Canadian history.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/55CvqTZ98zBKl9M4tukHOK4pq31.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Continuous Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Kazimi","original_name":"Ali Kazimi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/iTZAXzVJIEfWnCz0f2qgnNPxij7.jpg","credit_id":"595972599251410a5902b139","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0490857","wikidata_id":"Q28132675","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1081,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/55CvqTZ98zBKl9M4tukHOK4pq31.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":711}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
