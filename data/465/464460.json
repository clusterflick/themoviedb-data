Let It Be is a documentary that records the daily labor and lives of three elderly rice farmers in Tainan County’s Houbi Township. In the heart of Taiwan’s rice-producing country, they have passed their days shedding a bead of sweat to match each grain of rice. The film depicts their lifestyles which have changed little over the last half-century. Observing their toil at work and the way they go about their lives allows the viewer to appreciate the wisdom that imbues their lives and the fascinating dynamics of their relationships with each other, their animals, the gods, the weather, and the land. Between the vastness of the heavens and the joys and sorrows of the earth and its inhabitants, each farmer fulfills his unique destiny.","popularity":0.168,"poster_path":"/vQpgWRUuVpU7KVVNvj3xJ5Kemdf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2005-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let It Be","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"無米樂","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1844023,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yen Lan-Chuan","original_name":"Yen Lan-Chuan","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595a6fef9251410bfa040699","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1844024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cres Chuang","original_name":"Cres Chuang","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/ozy4QnYueeH836B4fmXgwtVQUA3.jpg","credit_id":"595a6ffbc3a36828a1047998","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4692874","wikidata_id":"Q3847174","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vQpgWRUuVpU7KVVNvj3xJ5Kemdf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
