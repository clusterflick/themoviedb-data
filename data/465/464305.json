Hosted by Bon Clay/Mr. 2 & Buggy the Clown. The Straw Hat Pirates are now up showing off their skills in baseball. All 7 of them are up against the Arlong Pirates (This includes Arlong, Momoo, Chuu, Kuroobi, Hacchi, and several Skypiea characters for backup on both teams). This is unlike any ordinary baseball game, as Arlong's team uses iron spiked balls instead of regular baseballs to make Luffy and his team lose. After one strike out to another, it becomes 3-0 for the final inning. Will Luffy's team be able to defeat Arlong's team?","popularity":1.0812,"poster_path":"/7NJz6sLxEgk5a6u6WCBWs9qVo6i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5542,"logo_path":"/ayE4LIqoAWotavo7xdvYngwqGML.png","name":"Toei Animation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2004-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Piece: Take Aim!
