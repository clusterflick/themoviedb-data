At 13, his life changed: through a series of visions, Dawa acquired the gift of telling the epic story of Tibetâ€™s King Gesar. Now, at 35, Dawa receives a salary from the government as a guardian of national cultural heritage and is regarded as a holy man by his community. When an earthquake reduces his hometown to rubble, redevelopment of the region takes a giant leap forward. In the midst of such seismic shifts, Dawa seeks healing from King Gesar and other divine protectors of the land.","popularity":0.6071,"poster_path":"/t6EhkXrevE8wCFAtYV7wNvBQmh3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92001,"logo_path":null,"name":"alive mind","origin_country":""},{"id":39134,"logo_path":"/sijjN3vMtjCnc1LkCM7HSBErcO3.png","name":"Kino Lorber","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Young nomad Dawa's life was transformed at age 13 when a series of visions led to his remarkable gift for telling the epic tale of Tibet's King Gesar.","title":"A Gesar Bard's Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1843610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dawa Drakpa","original_name":"Dawa Drakpa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59598f12c3a36827500287bb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1843568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donagh Coleman","original_name":"Donagh Coleman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595973249251410b8602c131","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1843569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lharigtso","original_name":"Lharigtso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59597359925141088302be2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t6EhkXrevE8wCFAtYV7wNvBQmh3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4558,"name":"tibet"},{"id":208975,"name":"nomad"},{"id":236416,"name":"king gesar"},{"id":236417,"name":"bard"},{"id":236418,"name":"oral tradition"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bo","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Gesar Bard's Tale","key":"5LCaLySfN8Y","published_at":"2015-05-20T10:26:14.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"59597454925141225100f9c9"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lharitgso and Donagh","key":"dxCdV48xwUU","published_at":"2014-03-17T14:17:25.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"595aaddf9251410c56040c04"}]}}}
