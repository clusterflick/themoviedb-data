His parents and an old girl-friend, Sally - whom he hasn't seen for years, are expecting him at the dock. But, due to some unfortunate coincidences they are mistaken about the identity of each other, but meet unbeknownst to that fact. Jimmie decides that he has to find that girl. Finally, after having annoyed a policeman, and a great fraction of the female population, he finds her working as a temperance worker. To get her attention, he dresses up in rags to meet her. But his way of introduction causes more confusion.","popularity":0.4529,"poster_path":"/flDMTUrHimQdPkZzcx9J6nWyr2t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking for Sally","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Chase","original_name":"Charley Chase","popularity":0.3584,"profile_path":"/bIJBRLtjiZtrq3c9uDYn1Cl5a7J.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jimmy Jump","credit_id":"595e8904925141225107008b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Grant","original_name":"Katherine Grant","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/iVWXfb8B1gYrspOuQIaiaMEo5iD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sally Kavanaugh","credit_id":"595e891d925141225107009c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah Young","original_name":"Noah Young","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/g6JErSrooY8JZgUkADkFiBNGXiP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Detective","credit_id":"595e8932c3a36828a109d7d5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Willis","original_name":"Leo Willis","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/mUECrWjpFTvDDbaKKCebmg8HjDm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cop","credit_id":"595e895ac3a368293b093a9a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bynunsky Hyman","original_name":"Bynunsky Hyman","popularity":0.0432,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Man on Ship","credit_id":"61d217559a3c49001c6fc4ed","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John T.
