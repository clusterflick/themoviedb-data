In the small village of Vrontados on the Greek island of Chios, there is unrest. For over a century, parishioners of two Greek Orthodox churches have engaged in a battle on Holy Saturday, firing more than 100,000 homemade rockets at each otherâ€™s churches once the sun goes down.  Its origin is unclear. One theory holds that churches on the island faked a civil war during the Turkish occupation so they could celebrate Easter without being plagued by war. Accordingly the ruse worked, as the Turks kept a safe distance, allowing the villagers to attend Easter Mass.","popularity":0.0492,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":130051,"logo_path":null,"name":"Variable","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rocket Wars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salomon Ligthelm","original_name":"Salomon Ligthelm","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/5hHvQqBG3LQvuqfsve1nsAPvNLB.jpg","credit_id":"5e5ec629303c8500193d7ace","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2229739,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Khalid Mohtaseb","original_name":"Khalid Mohtaseb","popularity":0.1276,"profile_path":"/c33uWPtBKaZNwe8YVYlwhJWQoVm.jpg","credit_id":"5e5ec6403acd20001299b829","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2556325,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Friedman","original_name":"Alex Friedman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5ec6523acd20001799ac11","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salomon Ligthelm","original_name":"Salomon Ligthelm","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/5hHvQqBG3LQvuqfsve1nsAPvNLB.jpg","credit_id":"5e5ec669357c0000132ea467","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
