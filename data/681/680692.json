Anita isn’t compatible, and neither is Tonino, her grandfather shepherd who lives in the nearby tableland, close to a military base which affect the area since the Sixties. There is uncle Gaetano: being Jacopo’s brother the probability that he is compatible is higher, but Gaetano is a hothead and he and Jacopo haven’t had any relationship at all: an old grudge, which they don’t want to forget, is keeping them apart.","popularity":0.0872,"poster_path":"/7Xv2uwLpgu0Po3jd6ToJIo3qMtW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102339,"logo_path":null,"name":"Articolture","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":115211,"logo_path":null,"name":"MAT
