Desperate for affection, Maxine grabs hold of 'Noodle,' an enigmatic wanderer on his way to the Sierras, and convinces him to take her on his road trip where she discovers the beauty of nature. On their journey, Maxine falls for Noodle, but his haunting secret keeps him distant. Part comedy, part drama, I AM THAT GIRL is a love story that truly captures the spirit of D.I.Y. film-making and comments on American credit card culture while revealing the beauty of the simpler things in life.","popularity":0.7881,"poster_path":"/8Ua3f2GAHlLtvgHdVuIlIWYIxUH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130004,"logo_path":null,"name":"Idylwild Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am That Girl","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1786368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Rowe","original_name":"Grace Rowe","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/qbCtSN2SaDpVy1BE94bha9lhJb0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Maxine","credit_id":"5e5d8b9855c926001354a272","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Jaworski","original_name":"Michael Jaworski","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Noodle","credit_id":"5e5d8ba9357c0000112c94b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1709729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megan Molloy","original_name":"Megan Molloy","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Megan","credit_id":"5e5d8bb79b86160018fd0ee0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1842789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mandy Henderson","original_name":"Mandy Henderson","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Michelle","credit_id":"5e5d8bc687e63e001774c7ce","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2939710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Byer","original_name":"Gabriel Byer","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ted","credit_id":"60041a75223e200040b70b7a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1319440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cooper Barnes","original_name":"Cooper Barnes","popularity":1.2709,"profile_path":"/b9Pqy8KU4TVnLhvkASxrNmljvkE.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Terry","credit_id":"60041a7fa67254004012d308","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz Stewart","original_name":"Liz Stewart","popularity":0.2111,"profile_path":"/1IId6Ke30WNkgR67eK8vKWAg2eN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"60041a900328b9003ee1dc2a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Ferrucci","original_name":"Matt Ferrucci","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Sobe","credit_id":"60041ab0a67254003e12775c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1253360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Pascal","original_name":"Pedro Pascal","popularity":24.5552,"profile_path":"/kpaBw1oyfu2vGS2t9gGBz1Pz7vk.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Noah","credit_id":"60041abb904f6d003fc3d988","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2555601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"B.
