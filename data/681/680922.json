Sturdiness jousts with fragility, past with present, alienation with tenderness, abrasiveness with sensuality, red with green. The camera is moving in the slick of space. Shapes vibrate selectively out of the image; others at different points in space and in turn, vibrate or flash as vibrations also vary in rhythms and intensity. The Kinemacolor process was use in 1915 to obtain fairly illusionistic colors from black and white films by filming and projecting them through synchronized, alternating red and green filters. This film, while already in color, takes advantage of many of the particularities of the system.","popularity":0.1449,"poster_path":"/84qzQmjD7cuUT6BE6NKv3bziWcD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tremors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Grenier","original_name":"Vincent Grenier","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/9Pbwc4bS0m40fU5HdQU04Iw5tmB.jpg","credit_id":"5e61f12f8e2ba60018de3705","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/84qzQmjD7cuUT6BE6NKv3bziWcD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
