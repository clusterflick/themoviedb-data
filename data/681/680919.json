Through repetition of this approach, the movement and the framing become a sensual force —and the objects appear in all their voluptuousness. Gerson has employed this technique repeatedly. In his Translucent Appearances (1975), thirty-five different shots of Niagara Falls are blocked by horizontal, monochromatic mattes. The object is shaped —water flowing seeking a form that will suffice. These are films that disclose gradually, changing revealed and unrevealed layers of visual information.\" Mónica Savirón","popularity":0.0464,"poster_path":"/4IFP61wOCl9fnfE3F3GDx3kHJRU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Translucent Appearances","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1783744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Gerson","original_name":"Barry Gerson","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/rG4x1EZhdrdDfJijSc2oUgShIsW.jpg","credit_id":"5e61ef7855c92600195a88fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4IFP61wOCl9fnfE3F3GDx3kHJRU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
