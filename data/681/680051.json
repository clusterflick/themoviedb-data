One night while a comedian who owns a bar in the hotel gives him a drink, he breaks out in song and discovers a great voice. Under a psychiatrist's treatment, and because of a blow to the head by some hoodlums, he realizes his name is David and that he was the son of a great Jewish Cantor, and gradually recovers his memory of losing his parents. He gives up a promising career singing in nightclubs to return to the synagogue.","popularity":0.6956,"poster_path":"/4zruwdYYlTC8AMttbpWRtn0OQ4v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130015,"logo_path":null,"name":"A.N.O.
