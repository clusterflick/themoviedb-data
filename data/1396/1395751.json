In depicting moments of change or redefinition for these physical bodies, Well Dressed imagines unexpected points of convergence. Integrating devices of narrative, fantasy, documentary, and the confessional, Well Dressed is a series of provocations. Each gesture points to failures and fantasies-- the failed sexual cruise between the young queer body and an older male, the fantasy of sex between the gender queer body and the biological male, a friendship between a transitioned FTM and a pre-op FTM, the queering of maternity, and the return to the fetus and newborn. These scenes recontextualize narratives of sex, birth, and becoming.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Well Dressed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2632443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elliot Montague","original_name":"Elliot Montague","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b983e51227e9b99bf2d7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
