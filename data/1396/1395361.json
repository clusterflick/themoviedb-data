Originally, New Order recorded the song as an upbeat new wave tune in 1982. With Hi Tiger's re-imagining some 30 years later, The Village becomes a torch song that meditates on themes of love and loss, complicity and defiance. In the context of HIV and AIDS, the song becomes a love letter to those that have passed and a call to arms for the ones who remain.  Commissioned by Visual AIDS in 2014 as part of ALTERNATE ENDINGS, a program of seven videos that bring together charged moments and personal memories amidst the public history of HIV/AIDS.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Village","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3638399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hi Tiger","original_name":"Hi Tiger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674a1c34987d86c0eea00724","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5080451,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Visual AIDS","original_name":"Visual AIDS","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674a1c3a987d86c0eea00735","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
