In this award-winning production from the Opéra de Monte-Carlo, co-produced with Teatro Arriaga in Bilbao, visionary director Emilio Sagi crafts a whimsical journey that earned Best New Opera Production at the 2014 Teatro Campoamor Lyric Awards. Set in a world where imagination and deception collide, the story follows the gullible Buonafede, an old man tricked into believing he’s been transported to the moon. Goldoni’s sharp satire on human credulity meets Haydn’s elegant, playful score, full of creative flourishes and refined humor. Known as the father of the symphony and string quartet, Haydn’s operatic genius shines in this delightful fable, long overshadowed by his contemporaries but brought to vivid life in a production brimming with charm, humor, and lunar magic. Prepare for a journey where the moon feels closer than ever!","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/ck49nkXK51mfhBd3oXOw0hGw0TT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151692,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro di San Carlo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2014-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Teatro di San Carlo","title":"Il Mondo della Luna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5091200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Do","original_name":"Philippe Do","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ecclitico","credit_id":"674b39fa6935b13614d3ee51","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppina Bridelli","original_name":"Giuseppina Bridelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bN3p8fkuuTSt4aqIVc1WgSiYdJD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ernesto","credit_id":"674b3a12987d86c0eea02054","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1352068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto De Candia","original_name":"Roberto De Candia","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Buonafede","credit_id":"674b3a2e1e61e927de18d1e6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélène Guilmette","original_name":"Hélène Guilmette","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Clarice","credit_id":"674b3a3fe2df00a3bb785520","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1575811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandra Marianelli","original_name":"Alessandra Marianelli","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Flaminia","credit_id":"674b3a51987d86c0eea0206d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annalisa Stroppa","original_name":"Annalisa Stroppa","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lisetta","credit_id":"674b3a60e2df00a3bb78552e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4301309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathias Vidal","original_name":"Mathias Vidal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Cecco","credit_id":"674b3a86e2df00a3bb785552","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174993,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jérémie Rhorer","original_name":"Jérémie Rhorer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bEhCGtV1VNSli5X8ivQATxhszht.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"674b3a981e61e927de18d217","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2085913,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joseph Haydn","original_name":"Joseph Haydn","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/1ogxPO7AihKswp02N2INGfxUvaH.jpg","credit_id":"674b3aa71e61e927de18d22c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilio Sagi","original_name":"Emilio Sagi","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b3ab8b72de59123ee5dc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2346,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ck49nkXK51mfhBd3oXOw0hGw0TT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
