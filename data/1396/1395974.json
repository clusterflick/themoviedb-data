The photographs depict a range of high and low forms of wall art, while asking,  ‘Graffiti, art or vandalism’?.  The repetitive tags question if identify based graffiti is territorial or part of a community spirit? Is there an inherent social need to make one’s mark? And what is our relationship with the environment we inhabit?  The film is dated to the 1st & 2nd July to emphasise that graffiti is a temporary art. If this project was repeated any later, the same landscapes and subjects would have changed.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/kyazIaufrl4Uk1KG8MOKxLlXm9z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Criminal Damage Art","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2831385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Power","original_name":"Andrew Power","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1EvGOZvOkmMBryyhZu6Md8WxWXL.jpg","credit_id":"674c63e7386283927de019c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kyazIaufrl4Uk1KG8MOKxLlXm9z.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mZAUjTq2yPQDhmWM8nv6YxU9Fr6.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
