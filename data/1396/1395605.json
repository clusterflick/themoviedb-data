Abbado emphasized the psychological and political tensions within the story, employing stark sets and subdued colors to evoke a timeless, oppressive atmosphere. Lighting played a crucial role, intensifying the focus on the characters' inner struggles and conflicts. The cast featured René Pape as a commanding and deeply nuanced Philip II, alongside Ramón Vargas as Don Carlo and Anja Harteros, who delivered a luminous and emotionally charged portrayal of Elisabetta.","popularity":0.1517,"poster_path":"/fiWuRGj1VjBiXmDhfztxC30HNar.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72205,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wiener Staatsoper","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2016-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":205,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Wiener Staatsoper","title":"Don Carlo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramón Vargas","original_name":"Ramón Vargas","popularity":0.1114,"profile_path":"/oPUpcdxxlLU8ZPWbuzdMbzpjmzM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Don Carlo","credit_id":"674b22c5f043bc8a6771ae77","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Harteros","original_name":"Anja Harteros","popularity":0.0909,"profile_path":"/o2PNgibpNbj9Rt3hKVSdzIOqWp4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elisabetta di Valois","credit_id":"674b2328339b7b670c9c7a5d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Pape","original_name":"René Pape","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/1VsWqoYANXZNivalpSZfNNqny2H.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Filippo II","credit_id":"674b232f51d26ba93c78ae20","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1267405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludovic Tézier","original_name":"Ludovic Tézier","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/u9OD8isxAGK1oLJBs2HSHFCYo07.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rodrigo","credit_id":"674b2355b72de59123ee591e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ain Anger","original_name":"Ain Anger","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Il Grande Inquisitore","credit_id":"674b236c339b7b670c9c7a72","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1123525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Béatrice Uria-Monzon","original_name":"Béatrice Uria-Monzon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jHzfOps9lW1B3Us24926xXQB8sQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"La Principessa Eboli","credit_id":"674b239f0117851cd01c26a7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ileana Tonca","original_name":"Ileana Tonca","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Tebaldo","credit_id":"674b23b8f043bc8a6771aeb5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myung-Whun Chung","original_name":"Myung-Whun Chung","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/un576D5OG0EXHRVYvfDtBTn5Czm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"674b23ca339b7b670c9c7a9f","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5091045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniele Abbado","original_name":"Daniele Abbado","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b23ef6935b13614d3ea44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"674b23fa0117851cd01c26c9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2346,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fiWuRGj1VjBiXmDhfztxC30HNar.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
