Now, states are fighting to have the status removed, opening the door for hunters and ranchers to once again decimate the wolf population. This documentary is about the incredible journey of OR-7, a Grey Wolf which was collared in Oregon and eventually dispersed from his pack. A journey that tells the story not only of OR-7, but of the wolf as a species in America. It is a journey of survival. A journey of inspiration.","popularity":0.3238,"poster_path":"/pHPC5spqNurlAuY45afoMovyDWB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Or7: The Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5089118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.
