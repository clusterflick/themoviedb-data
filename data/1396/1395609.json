In this production Zeffirelli returns to a representative Super classic line, renewing the complex mechanisms of almost all his other productions (Il corriere musicale) with beautiful classic costumes by Maurizio Millenotti and lights by Paolo Mazzon (L'ape musicale). Carlos Álvarez is of beautiful voice (GP Opera) and presumably todays best Don Giovanni (L'ape musicale) while Irina Lungu is one of the best lyric sopranes (L'ape musicale). Donna Elvira, being sung by Maria José Siri was clearly and advantageously represented by her mellow and beguiling voice.
