It focuses on portraying and immersing the viewer in the cultural setting of Umbanda through interviews with workers and participants, interwoven with the full recording of the gira process. The project's aim is to demystify and break stereotypes associated with Umbanda's popular image in Brazilian culture, offering an emotional and personal perspective to bring the stories of those involved with the religion to the screen. It aligns with the general research areas of Communication: Ethics, Philosophy, and Religion, emphasizing religion (as a set of cultural systems, beliefs, and worldviews that establish symbols connecting humanity to spirituality and moral values), along with the specific research areas of narratives, memories, and identities.","popularity":0.1266,"poster_path":"/nRWCbuh4SXYht4TP486Afsr0NzO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":247671,"logo_path":null,"name":"Retravo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A
