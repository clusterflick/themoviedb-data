Only 7 half-hour episodes were produced, which were broadcast on the ABC. Real television commercials from the 1970s were shown during the program's \"commercial breaks\".  The show featured four \"funky\" undercover detectives: undetectable as police, given their \"hipness\". The conclusion of each episode was deliberately designed to be incredibly predictable: usually the perpetrator of the crime under investigation could be identified within the first few minutes of the episode.","popularity":0.4047,"poster_path":"/8vswbBt6X7mYRNPcZvDL00faHAz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1253,"logo_path":"/6f0A0AqIPHYheRb90tVMutuzSnP.png","name":"Australian Broadcasting
