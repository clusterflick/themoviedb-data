Through never-before-seen archival footage shot over 35 years, this documentary offers exclusive access to the man behind the Rocket myth. Designed by Serge Giguère and Robert Tremblay, who died before completing this project, MAURICE paints an intimate and authentic portrait of Maurice Richard, well beyond his exploits on the ice rink. More than a hockey player, he embodies the perseverance and hope of a people, forever marking Quebec culture.","popularity":0.7278,"poster_path":"/5Qc7jDFHAcOfZMs7fkdLIPwSlCI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20437,"logo_path":"/udmAwsZVjwjUCtz2gBMswim46kM.png","name":"Les Productions du Rapide-Blanc","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2025-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maurice","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Richard","original_name":"Maurice Richard","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sMkfKU3wf78WXDUzNRkGD7XIgyr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6749e65b39e6f43e30d96e6b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Giguère","original_name":"Serge Giguère","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6749e37d151d17c16a26ea42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1323501,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sylvie van Brabant","original_name":"Sylvie van Brabant","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6749e38e19902e039f080297","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205338,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Sylvie Krasker","original_name":"Sylvie Krasker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6749e39a1650a5e353390ae6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2000219,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amélie Lambert Bouchard","original_name":"Amélie Lambert Bouchard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6797ffc10a30d6d059242aac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1457660,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Benjamin Duffield","original_name":"Benjamin Duffield","popularity":0.1003,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798002e0a30d6d059242ae8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372743,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bertrand Chénier","original_name":"Bertrand Chénier","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67980038372cb20cf8237717","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sylvain Bellemare","original_name":"Sylvain Bellemare","popularity":0.3217,"profile_path":"/kGsqhWsy3TP92U5widUlBgUkLV4.jpg","credit_id":"67980044372cb20cf823771d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1613175,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Katerine Giguère","original_name":"Katerine Giguère","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798135db99d7e78c78f1b32","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Giguère","original_name":"Serge Giguère","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798137016f0d960df23c782","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34812189","wikidata_id":"Q131302021","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/5Qc7jDFHAcOfZMs7fkdLIPwSlCI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":1544,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xe2mds06NXrlSlr0Ip82T7M3y8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1014}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242541,"name":"local legend"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":289584,"name":"hockey"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
