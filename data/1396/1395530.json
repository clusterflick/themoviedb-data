Police said they couldn’t stop him with pepper spray or a truncheon. There was no single footage to reproduce the mysterious incident aside from some crime site photos taken by the media. While researching the case, we found a record from the public hearing dictated by the police department. We made this video based on the record. However, since there’s no testimony from Nguyễn Quốc Phi, the film remained two police officers fighting by themselves.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(Nguyễn Quốc Phi)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
