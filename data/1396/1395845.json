Weerasethakul, whose previous works have brought the invisible, inaudible and untouchable into our realm of the tangible, has greatly expanded the virtual space by making use of augmented and virtual reality. Fifteen audience members at a time are invited into a dark space to roam around, experiencing Weerasethakul’s visual poetry beyond the confines of language, soundscapes of silent waves by Sakamoto Ryuichi, and interactive particles of light floating through the air... They are invited into the depths of memory and existence in a dreamlike world where the origins of life and the afterlife coexist.
