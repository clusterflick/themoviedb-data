The documentary follows the journey of photographers Christian Pirskanen and Jennifer Janowski and Edward Dwornik, who joins them, from Krakow to Kyiv, giving the viewer the opportunity to get to know everyday life in the midst of war.  Even though air raids disrupt everyday life almost every day, people still try to live as normal life as possible. The interviewees openly talk about their own experiences, what goes on inside the head when you have to pull the trigger for the first time or how it feels to flee a war, leaving everything behind. Flowers for hope is about survival, hope and the power of people in the midst of difficulties.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/37xgUIEhGqnnsC2EiUIdGygDcXJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flowers for hope - Travel documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5091816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Pirskanen","original_name":"Christian Pirskanen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"674b89742d7800f5358a43c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5091819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Janowski","original_name":"Jennifer Janowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"674b899839f0453bf43e569a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5091823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Dwornik","original_name":"Edward Dwornik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"674b89aa615d3a3b41b71ac3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5091816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Pirskanen","original_name":"Christian Pirskanen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b8d7b615d3a3b41b71cd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/37xgUIEhGqnnsC2EiUIdGygDcXJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Flowers For Hope - TRAILER","key":"UASahRJEu9w","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-15T15:37:33.000Z","id":"674b89012d7800f5358a4368"}]}}}
