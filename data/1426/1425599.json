Playing off the prevalent conspiracy theory, the comedy is set in a world where a microchip planted in the vaccine causes the body to shut down in a \"blue scream of death,\" killing everyone on the planet except the ant-vaxxers. The film follows seven neighboring survivors as they selfishly navigate a post-apocalyptic world. The subjects include a religious zealot (Matt Mindell), a dooms-day prepper (James Morgan), an environmentalist (Natalia Borges), an actor who feared the vaccine's cosmetic side effects (Manoli Ioannidis), a workaholic who was too busy to get vaccinated (Llewellyn Connolly), and a gamer who was too lazy to make an appointment (Jasmine Cornielle).","popularity":0.1786,"poster_path":"/k8PhXgPBxtt93DXTeiDOKFkZiPc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vax","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2189116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manoli Ioannidis","original_name":"Manoli Ioannidis","popularity":0.0451,"profile_path":"/1ZcNmTyEEObLiKhfBbqZYi07pCO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mateo","credit_id":"6799eaebb4b6f91453a9745c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3859003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Mindell","original_name":"Matt Mindell","popularity":0.0647,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mr. Aberdeen","credit_id":"6799eafc83d7aae2f0279f02","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4354092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jazmine Cornielle","original_name":"Jazmine Cornielle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Zoe","credit_id":"6799eb26f2ff0dde55c0d0de","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14788092","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k8PhXgPBxtt93DXTeiDOKFkZiPc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
