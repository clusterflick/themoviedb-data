This early work offers a portrait of painter-educator-pacifist Anna Ottonie Krigar-Menzel, also known as Annot. Suppressed by the Nazis and forced into exile, it’s tempting to consider Annot a key inspiration for Raganelli, as one of her main works is a late 1920s cycle of paintings called Faces of Working Women, depicting female surgeons, physiotherapists, all manner of women’s labour.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":187661,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diorama Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1976-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Annot – Portrait of a Painter and Pacifist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1177860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katja Raganelli","original_name":"Katja Raganelli","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/h96OlmCEbHPeWKVXJmLxffrS4O7.jpg","credit_id":"67990367192115901e8f7d7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1177860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katja Raganelli","original_name":"Katja Raganelli","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/h96OlmCEbHPeWKVXJmLxffrS4O7.jpg","credit_id":"6799036ee1d5a9c6e08f1c43","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2195338,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Konrad Wickler","original_name":"Konrad Wickler","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67990377b921c548d82afcee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5209176,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christl Heider","original_name":"Christl Heider","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6799037f1be116409c237c7a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6empaU57QMHRyrlDxy9m4tqrg2p.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2025-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
