In close-up. The smallest movements and vibrations on this face – designated neither male nor female – rouse Epstein to invent a delirious carnival of metaphors. The face is a landscape, a décor, a piano; a smile is an earthquake, a storm, a theatre curtain rising. Everything is dramatic, but there is not – not yet – any story. A single 30-second close-up of Carola Regnier in Stephen Dwoskin’s Behindert (1974) – a type of shot he often made – can incite the same reverie.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The thinking machine 56: Smile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1823065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristina Álvarez López","original_name":"Cristina Álvarez López","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798f2ebb99d7e78c78f37d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1823066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Martin","original_name":"Adrian Martin","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798f3025dc8b3b72d2b0736","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
