However, beneath their friendship, unspoken feelings lingered. Raj was deeply in love with Priya and hoped to confess his feelings, believing she felt the same. One evening, Raj finally gathered the courage to tell Priya how he felt. She listened quietly, her eyes full of emotion, and then gently said, \"Raj, I care for you deeply, but my heart belongs to someone else.\" Raj was heartbroken but asked, \"Who is it?\" Priya hesitated before admitting, \"It's Deepak.\" Deepak, who had no idea of Priya's feelings, was stunned when Raj revealed the truth to him. Prem, ever the peacemaker, stepped in to remind them that love was never meant to break bonds but to strengthen them. In the end, Tere Liye became a story not just about romantic love but about the love that keeps friendships alive through honesty, understanding, and acceptance.","popularity":0.2145,"poster_path":"/aGOikkHaRMYhbzDI4vofEC2AZY3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
