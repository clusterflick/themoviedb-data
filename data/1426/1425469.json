As his next of kin, she is asked to come to Berlin. Over the course of a night in her father's Berlin apartment she learns from his diaries about a trip he took with a friend to Italy in the early 2000s to research fascist-era buildings and sculptures. It is a trip that ended in tragedy. Latina, Latina is a timely and moving hybrid-documentary that looks at a political ideology through the objects and buildings it left behind.","popularity":0.0575,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":251722,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Arts Council of Ireland's Reel Art Fund","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2025-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Latina, Latina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5210244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabrina Mandanici","original_name":"Sabrina Mandanici","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Geologist","credit_id":"67997a41f2ff0dde55c0c4f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5210245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendy Erskine","original_name":"Wendy Erskine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Voice of Geologist","credit_id":"67997a51b4b6f91453a96a9d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5210246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niamh Dunphy","original_name":"Niamh Dunphy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Woman on street","credit_id":"67997a5d0400ec6f45c0c212","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2462855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Duncan","original_name":"Adrian Duncan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6799796bbd75caacdfc0c438","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2462855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Duncan","original_name":"Adrian Duncan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67997977cbaf554931c0c35f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Feargal Ward","original_name":"Feargal Ward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/unDYejjQrOlhGWgLjwvLKt2mrOH.jpg","credit_id":"67997a6ab4b6f91453a96aac","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5210248,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jonathan Sammon","original_name":"Jonathan Sammon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67997a74f82d6da2b9279979","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2462855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Duncan","original_name":"Adrian Duncan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67997a83f2ff0dde55c0c509","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dublin International Film Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
