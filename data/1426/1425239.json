In the midwater, pelagic wanderers tread migratory routes that span entire oceans, and planktonic drifters and their predators take part in bioluminescent light shows. It is separated into zones based on depth, including the sunlight zone (epipelagic), twilight zone (mesopelagic), midnight zone (bathypelagic), abyssal and hadal zones. And below, lies the deep sea floor. A kingdom of mud and ooze, where sessile creatures cling to any solid outcrop and corals craft kingdoms on the seamount crusts. The worlds of the deep sea could not be more different, and yet their stories are fundamentally intertwined. In this episode, we delve into the Midnight Zone and the Twilight Zone, where anglerfish, giant sharks, and bioluminescent wonders are found traversing the void. Join as we uncover fascinating deep ocean facts and mysteries.","popularity":0.0456,"poster_path":"/nKcaz5aJAcAKVsulcqLTHaBR0f5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into the Abyss: Creatures of the Midwater","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1124,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gxFbooQqcvbz9DyQSpHKCVw0ZEW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1499,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nKcaz5aJAcAKVsulcqLTHaBR0f5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
