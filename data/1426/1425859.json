Recently discharged from an upscale psychiatric facility where he was treated for acute depression, he is still wrestling with the pain of losing his beloved sister. Her deathbed revelation—that she can see spirits who are still tethered to the living world, a gift that runs in their family—sits uneasily with Tate, who struggles to believe in more than what reason can explain. But when he takes up residence at a historic bed-and-breakfast on the Cape, he encounters a beautiful young woman named Wren who will challenge every assumption he has about his logical and controlled world.","popularity":1.1292,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12236,"logo_path":"/bVu0qQm4GujSTCvZZz9S3rHDczA.png","name":"Blinding Edge Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Remain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal","original_name":"Jake Gyllenhaal","popularity":6.8307,"profile_path":"/rJdYHYNhlcOBwbPvDZVvt1xw7bi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tate Donovan","credit_id":"679a75a3819ed2eab0344007","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1232756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phoebe Dynevor","original_name":"Phoebe Dynevor","popularity":1.7643,"profile_path":"/gvriCFuwIvOoZyYph5YkYGZyFR9.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Wren","credit_id":"67d31fa641ca4f51433e050b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"M.
