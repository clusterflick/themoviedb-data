There is also the relentless battle against the media coverage of the Syrian conflict, insofar as mainstream media render invisible the thousand-and-one faces of the “revolution” (Abounaddara continues to use this term to describe the situation in the country)—a revolution that is trapped in the grotesque outside perception that there are now only two protagonists confronting each other: the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad on one side, jihadist extremists on the other.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video Compilation (2011-2016)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1488598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abounaddara Collective","original_name":"Abounaddara Collective","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67991f86702f492f478f8ed0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
