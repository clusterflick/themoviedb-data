This portrait of model Venus Baginski, the second episode of Fragments, takes an introspective journey into their understanding and experience of their body. Directed by Franco-British filmmaker and photographer Mélodie Roulaud, the film examines the language used to express the body, the self, and their representation, highlighting the connection between bodily experiences and identity.  Drawing inspiration from the theoretical framework of the female gaze, the film seeks to offer a perspective that honours the subject’s lived experience. Through this lens, the body becomes a site of personal agency, fluidity, and transformation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fragments - Episode 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
