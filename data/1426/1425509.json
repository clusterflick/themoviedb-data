It tells the story of Kurt Muse, a U.S. citizen who, along with a group of six Panamanians, formed a clandestine radio broadcasting network during Manuel Noriega’s dictatorship. Their mission was to intercept and sabotage the communications of Panama’s National Guard to spark an uprising against the regime.  35 years after these events, they decide to step out of anonymity and share their story. The documentary explores the risks and sacrifices of those involved, highlighting the fine line between heroism and danger. More than just a historical chronicle, it delves into the psychology of its protagonists, the silent decisions that shaped their destiny, and the personal and collective impact of living in the shadows.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PA","name":"Panama"}],"release_date":"2025-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Señal de la Libertad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mercedes Arias","original_name":"Mercedes Arias","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6799922cb09359e5cca9679d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Delfina Vidal","original_name":"Delfina Vidal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67999240b09359e5cca967b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
