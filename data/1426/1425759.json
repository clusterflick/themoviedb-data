But his practice isn't going well, especially regarding his chip shots. When his mother, Nandani, comes home, things go downhill even faster. They argue over everything from food to Amit's swearing to getting Tiger Woods's name wrong, but underlying their conversation is their sadness over the recent passing of Amit's father. But when Nandani reveals herself as a quick study of the short game, Amit soon discovers that his mother knows more than he thinks.","popularity":0.048,"poster_path":"/pbEo4PtFMcSbfA3SKlus5koV2d5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birdie Cricket","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4853031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anish Chandak","original_name":"Anish Chandak","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Amit","credit_id":"679a465183d7aae2f027ad7d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2410995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Chandwaney","original_name":"Anita Chandwaney","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Nandani","credit_id":"679a466d306b6a135627a829","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5211176,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neil Tuli","original_name":"Neil Tuli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679a45c4b4b6f91453a98506","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5211176,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neil Tuli","original_name":"Neil Tuli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679a45cf306b6a135627a806","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5211176,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neil Tuli","original_name":"Neil Tuli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679a45e0306b6a135627a80f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5211178,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Reyna Rios-Starr","original_name":"Reyna Rios-Starr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679a45ff028a42238027a83d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32659097","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1499,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pbEo4PtFMcSbfA3SKlus5koV2d5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
