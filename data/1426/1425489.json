These Magdalene women and the children of the Mother & Baby Homes might still be shrouded in secrecy and shame, if not for the work of Justice For Magdalenes. This tiny group of women lawyers, academics and volunteers have together waged an extraordinary battle on behalf of the survivors of Irish institutions. This documentary tells their story.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2025-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Testimony","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aoife Kelleher","original_name":"Aoife Kelleher","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6799851efc14d24e35a96d4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aoife Kelleher","original_name":"Aoife Kelleher","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67998522f2ff0dde55c0c603","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dublin International Film Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
