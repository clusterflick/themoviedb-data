The Invisible Battles of Ukrainian Military Medics\" follows a group of Ukrainian military medics as they travel from the challenging realities of Ukraine to a peaceful retreat in Sweden. The medics, who have faced intense pressures and difficult situations since the escalation of the war in 2022, are given the opportunity to rest and reflect. Amid the calm of the Swedish forests, they begin to process their experiences, sharing personal stories about the emotional and psychological challenges they’ve faced. The film sheds light on the importance of mental health support for those who have been on the frontlines, focusing on the need for care and understanding in a time of great hardship.","popularity":0.5172,"poster_path":"/wCzJ1zeIzAku40zXeuGMWjF7J9p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":251670,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kyiv Independent","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2024-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Can You Hear Me?
