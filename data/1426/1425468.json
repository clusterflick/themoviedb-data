Institutionalised and labelled, she reclaims her narrative through her canvas. As she prepares for her first retrospective, her story reaches national newspapers, and she navigates the vulnerability of sharing her art and her truth. Will this confrontation lead to healing or a reopening of old wounds? Through immersive explorations of her luminous works, Jiménez’s documentary captures Amanda’s transformation of silence into radiance.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":170462,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Rose Films","origin_country":""},{"id":251722,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Arts Council of Ireland's Reel Art Fund","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2025-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amanda","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3911538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Miguel Jiménez","original_name":"José Miguel Jiménez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vepNjpJ9MPrBe2QXt9z3X0NOCuj.jpg","credit_id":"67997603cbaf554931c0c2bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3911538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Miguel Jiménez","original_name":"José Miguel Jiménez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vepNjpJ9MPrBe2QXt9z3X0NOCuj.jpg","credit_id":"67997607cbaf554931c0c2c1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3235061,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roisin Geraghty","original_name":"Roisin Geraghty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6799762fcbaf554931c0c2cd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dublin International Film Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
