Ajaya and his wife Prabha move to Kathmandu, where Ajaya starts working as a teacher. Later, his sister Gita joins them and enrolls in the same college. There, she meets a kind and charming student, but trouble arises when Madhav, a troublesome student, also starts liking her. One day, a fight breaks out in the college, and when Gita tries to stop it, an inspector arrives and brings the situation under control. Angered by this, Madhav and his group cause harm to Prabha and Gita. They also try to escape punishment through legal means. With no strong evidence, Ajaya takes a stand and challenges the court. In the end, he decides to take justice into his own hands, leading to a tragic ending where the inspector, fulfilling his duty, stops Ajaya. Chunauti is a story of love, courage, and sacrifice in the face of injustice.","popularity":0.1554,"poster_path":"/c4QoGh7ig1l5mx42XQ1sYPauF1Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chunauti","video":true,"vote_average":9.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumud Pant","original_name":"Kumud Pant","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":"/6qYgWw2lI6SnzpMk6Nt7loaH7yy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Neil Kanthe","credit_id":"679a7740d04b03bd9f344086","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1922484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shree Krishna Shrestha","original_name":"Shree Krishna Shrestha","popularity":0.2641,"profile_path":"/pcfQsfMd1XS5CDqe4bmMFjPBG1X.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Inspector","credit_id":"679a779b04c8dc347cfbb6f3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1943266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saroj Khanal","original_name":"Saroj Khanal","popularity":0.1301,"profile_path":"/eJwyet6EO1F3HXDWzyDLHmzbudT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ajaya","credit_id":"679a77ee4ebc991ea4bd660e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1943268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajaram Poudyal","original_name":"Rajaram Poudyal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ta2rExTRMBkF6WGncXE5oq3MOcR.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ajaya's Friend","credit_id":"679a7881b00d3bad92bd6890","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bipana Thapa","original_name":"Bipana Thapa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Gita","credit_id":"679a7763b00d3bad92bd6852","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5209944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohan Nirula","original_name":"Mohan Nirula","popularity":0.1962,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Madhav's Father","credit_id":"679a7824d04b03bd9f3440be","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1950081,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Biju Ranjit","original_name":"Biju Ranjit","popularity":0.1699,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Madhav","credit_id":"679a7843819ed2eab034407e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5211740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laxmi Bohara","original_name":"Laxmi Bohara","popularity":0.1563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Prabha","credit_id":"679a849c4448da3d2abd6b63","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5211660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naresh Kumar Poudel","original_name":"Naresh Kumar Poudel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679a78f904c8dc347cfbb75b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1950081,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Biju Ranjit","original_name":"Biju Ranjit","popularity":0.1699,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679a7941b00d3bad92bd68be","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3280129,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brajesh Khanal","original_name":"Brajesh Khanal","popularity":0.1918,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679a7a2387e0804ec3bd6891","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5093788","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nLbFSu6bFHiKgYs7t4YkgmbMMUj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i2NGAmO112ynalUXArv0cG7aj7s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rZXPbZ3MlZrIVsoItpNwLx6eeWV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c4QoGh7ig1l5mx42XQ1sYPauF1Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ne","note":"","release_date":"1996-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Chunauti | Nepali Full Movie | Saroj Khanal | Shrikrishna Shrestha | Bipana Thapa | Rajajram Poudel","key":"iS6c0122Xl8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-10T18:30:05.000Z","id":"679a7a7cd04b03bd9f344165"}]}}}
