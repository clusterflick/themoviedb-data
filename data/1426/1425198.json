The sneaker success story presents the Cloudneo as the first sneaker to be entirely recyclable, durable and circular. Sure, these shoes are made from castor beans. But as for the rest...Our investigation reveals that On is far from meeting the industry's sustainability standards. The same goes for the myth of circularity. From the factory producing these shoes in Vietnam to the Arkema site in Marseille classified as a dangerous area because of the bromine, chlorine or ammonia used to transform castor beans into plastic, we are in reality light years away from a product that is good for the planet. Investigation in India, Vietnam and France.","popularity":0.1657,"poster_path":"/4PwCjnt4xJMDwvx1LTv5piSqKG7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2024-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laced With Lies, Federer's 'Eco-Friendly' Sneakers","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Os Ténis Pouco Ecológicos de Federer","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les baskets pas si vertes de Federer","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3476928,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jean-Marc Chevillard","original_name":"Jean-Marc Chevillard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679900901be116409c237b96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2722946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Corinne Portier","original_name":"Corinne Portier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6799009adf4b0191ce2b338f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vEipymkNqOkgFZ7Y40OuV5809rs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hMJBkdy7iawhm9M439KYHGbnCVr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1180,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4PwCjnt4xJMDwvx1LTv5piSqKG7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":824}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":193164,"name":"current affairs"},{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"},{"id":333328,"name":"sport"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"On Running : révélations sur les baskets de Federer | RTS","key":"825ocBKO-TY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-06-20T19:00:03.000Z","id":"6798ff9d192115901e8f7c9a"}]}}}
