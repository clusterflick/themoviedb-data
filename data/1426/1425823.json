We follow their journey as an American volunteer takes them from Africa to study with Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas.  They end up touring the States and raising hundreds of thousands of dollars, more than enough to build a permanent home. But how have the kids' experiences in America affected them? And how will it change things back home in Tanzania?  Tunahaki's heartfelt journey gives us something new to ponder as we reach across the world to help those less fortunateâ€”is it always the right thing to do?","popularity":0.1968,"poster_path":"/7FfDKjGE4N1DYOr20C6GrkvjKfR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98540,"logo_path":null,"name":"MEGAMACE Fitness Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nine Orphans, One Journey, and the Power of Hope, Love and Resilience","title":"TUNAHAKI","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5213815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdul Hamza","original_name":"Abdul Hamza","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"679b9cff4448da3d2abd91ba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2712868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Fifer","original_name":"Scott Fifer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"679b9d14125798ad4bbd8879","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5213822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Rytula","original_name":"David Rytula","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"679b9d2e04c8dc347cfbe2af","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Hamza","original_name":"Anna Hamza","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"herself","credit_id":"679bad434448da3d2abd9766","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert W.
