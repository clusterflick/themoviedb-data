Success goes to Tommyâ€™s head, he forgets June, surrounds himself with Broadway lowlife, spends extravagantly, and becomes infatuated with Mona Merwin, a musical comedy performer. He hits a rough patch, and June asks Berg to help her save Tommy from himself, so he decreases Tommy's royalty checks. Tommy's Broadway friends desert him when the checks stop coming. Now that Tommy has seen the error of his ways Berg sends him to a country cottage he purchased in Flatbush, where Tommy finds June waiting to marry him.","popularity":0.3052,"poster_path":"/fmgiit5hj02vDpkzRi2c9K41UaJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tin Pan Alley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Ray","original_name":"Albert Ray","popularity":0.135,"profile_path":"/1fWnTkcdKIEzi7JYALBSZRd9Sqd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tommy Breen","credit_id":"679a46a2306b6a135627a84c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elinor Fair","original_name":"Elinor Fair","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":"/obwXPqtyOjRsQjE16nKl3aNUd2c.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"June Norton","credit_id":"679a46ab0400ec6f45c0e6ed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":951261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Hernandez","original_name":"George Hernandez","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":"/qDb0rmbrShNUnopaFIx18hwugFL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Simon Berg","credit_id":"679a46b4306b6a135627a85b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Natheaux","original_name":"Louis Natheaux","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":"/h5TozPP8nx5hGdIfNr4vhaHZzMj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Blake","credit_id":"679a46bca3fef657cda97928","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Price","original_name":"Kate Price","popularity":0.1337,"profile_path":"/auh0gxFdHdeT08W9zEv9VQMYa95.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. O'Brian","credit_id":"679a46c7028a42238027a869","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Weed","original_name":"Frank Weed","popularity":0.0926,"profile_path":"/pnZATaW6qWMUzP8teop6IFP9vPr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Moriarity","credit_id":"679a46e3b4b6f91453a98539","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5211185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ardita Mellinina","original_name":"Ardita Mellinina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mona Merwin","credit_id":"679a46d70400ec6f45c0e71c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Persse","original_name":"Thomas Persse","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Fred Martindale","credit_id":"679a46ed01383cf1e6c0d07f","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Beal","original_name":"Frank Beal","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/ylU8TQ2FKkFl6RQ9BFbL2Njanki.jpg","credit_id":"679a473ba3fef657cda97973","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5211192,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Charles Lengel","original_name":"William Charles Lengel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679a474a0400ec6f45c0e770","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143569,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Anthony Roach","original_name":"Joseph Anthony Roach","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679a4753cbaf554931c0e2d9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0010782","wikidata_id":"Q67684674","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fmgiit5hj02vDpkzRi2c9K41UaJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":339367,"name":"lost in the fox film vault fire"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1919-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
