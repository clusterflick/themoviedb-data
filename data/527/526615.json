However, they have not gone very far before their dislike of each other flares into open conflict and they tumble together down a hill right into the path of a German patrol. It is now that Hamish's native Gaelic tongue comes to their aid, confusing the German soldiers and buying them precious time to come up with a plan to fool the Germans into letting them go. Transferred to Nazi Headquarters in Berlin, they must somehow pull together to survive. If not, death by firing squad is certain.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Gaelic","iso_639_1":"gd","name":""},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Darkest Hour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1502696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Don","original_name":"Stephen Don","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":"/9SmyW9fhOVbp4P9y9hh5HZap24A.jpg","credit_id":"5b0a8b12c3a3684b280041c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6039842","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
