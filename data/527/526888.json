Set 1 features live gut-busters from \"Your Show of Shows\" and \"Caesar's Hour\", including 18 of Caesar's own favorite sketches, plus revealing interviews with contemporaries, including Mel Brooks and Neil Simon. Three digitally remastered volumes: \"The Magic of Live TV, Inside the Writer's Room,\" and \"Creating the Comedy\". Almost 4 hours on 3 cassettes or 3 DVDs.","popularity":1.2053,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sid Caesar Collection:  Inside the Writer's Room","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Woody Allen","original_name":"Woody Allen","popularity":1.372,"profile_path":"/wcPQgZLDibuej1RwNTy1R2U2ZJw.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c3534c3a3680378002003","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Brooks","original_name":"Mel Brooks","popularity":1.5792,"profile_path":"/c21qNcMJlHnRolfhQhZOVacjtwI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c353ec3a3680390002044","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Caesar","original_name":"Sid Caesar","popularity":0.3597,"profile_path":"/mMSjieicMCMBK7YsQREkX7BRcB2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c3547c3a368039000204a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":160239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nanette Fabray","original_name":"Nanette Fabray","popularity":0.2714,"profile_path":"/6w1VAH7UHKBhovOlSfIQaRrTx9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5b0c3552c3a36803a5001f39","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18267,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Larry Gelbart","original_name":"Larry Gelbart","popularity":0.2234,"profile_path":"/cR7GQsZkm9Ju4q4VMFQaftLNacF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c355c0e0a264840001a5d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Morris","original_name":"Howard Morris","popularity":0.6213,"profile_path":"/nb50cjIZX1tBzXlXGWuzihKXgPB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c35680e0a26485d0016ee","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Reiner","original_name":"Carl Reiner","popularity":0.571,"profile_path":"/hNZNrwU2qysa2ijndIgkd6yjSCt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c3574c3a368039c0018a7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1225413,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Danny Simon","original_name":"Danny Simon","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c357fc3a368037800203f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584535,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neil Simon","original_name":"Neil Simon","popularity":0.3004,"profile_path":"/qZ5iSAEcV7hCVYIOrOD4CI2J5Wi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c3589c3a3680382001324","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1227326,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mel Tolkin","original_name":"Mel Tolkin","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c3593c3a368039c0018b2","order":9}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0282970","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156203,"name":"sketch comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
