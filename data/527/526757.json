Much was written about this notorious crime but little understood about the hidden, yet legal, tissue transplant industry that spawned it...until now. With exclusive access inside maximum-security prison to the man the NYPD labeled \"Public Enemy No.1\" this film charts how a former surgeon went from saving lives to ripping them apart.","popularity":0.0923,"poster_path":"/fI0iKyWHZv5lTVc3EUzLTKYq0HM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bearkatt Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bodysnatchers of New York","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1248117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Sherman","original_name":"William Sherman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Journalist","credit_id":"5b532d2c9251411f7e00f079","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Mastromarino","original_name":"Michael Mastromarino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b532d3c0e0a26231f00fc53","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Cruceta","original_name":"Lee Cruceta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b532d4d0e0a26231a010ba8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Dumaine","original_name":"Anthony Dumaine","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b532d699251411f7c00ec63","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dayna Ryan","original_name":"Dayna Ryan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b532d809251411f8600f788","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":35814,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toby Dye","original_name":"Toby Dye","popularity":0.1137,"profile_path":"/YoyMfwc3ZF3u1o792fWQEyARqS.jpg","credit_id":"5b0b6a669251411e0800ee74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088809,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julian Eguiguren","original_name":"Julian Eguiguren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b532dd90e0a2623270107a4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088811,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gary Johnston","original_name":"Gary Johnston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b532e3f9251411f8400f41b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":35814,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toby Dye","original_name":"Toby Dye","popularity":0.1137,"profile_path":"/YoyMfwc3ZF3u1o792fWQEyARqS.jpg","credit_id":"5b532e8ec3a3680b590129b4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2088812,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Denise Castelli","original_name":"Denise Castelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b532e6dc3a3680b5601005d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088810,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Faber","original_name":"Nick Faber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b532e2ec3a3680b5601000e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088813,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Graham Ebbs","original_name":"Graham Ebbs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b532e800e0a262327010868","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":35814,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toby Dye","original_name":"Toby Dye","popularity":0.1137,"profile_path":"/YoyMfwc3ZF3u1o792fWQEyARqS.jpg","credit_id":"5b532e990e0a2623120102a7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1803147","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fI0iKyWHZv5lTVc3EUzLTKYq0HM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
