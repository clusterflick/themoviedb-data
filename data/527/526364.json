Through interviews and by employing the so-called friendly-camera method, the director portrays these exhausted, sleepy people and their dreary daily grind. Their lives are particularly well reflected in the early morning scenes of salesmen asleep in the most peculiar places and in the most curious ways: leaning against a fence or a wall, sitting on the railway tracks.","popularity":0.0681,"poster_path":"/2NnWZzL1ZlwmolUTvX4uywLkj1h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5724,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zagreb Film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People on Wheels","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088229,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rudolf Sremec","original_name":"Rudolf Sremec","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b088a0bc3a36803e4000001","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088229,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rudolf Sremec","original_name":"Rudolf Sremec","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0889ef0e0a262fcf0002d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050742,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ilija Vukas","original_name":"Ilija Vukas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b088a3b92514133ee00001b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1305881,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lida Braniš","original_name":"Lida Braniš","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b088a580e0a264584000027","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305880,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anđelko Klobučar","original_name":"Anđelko Klobučar","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/aZSDYp7pX1XlMseDMO16S8bl5nv.jpg","credit_id":"5e45149f3dd12600185ae22e","department":"Sound","job":"Music Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0862746","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2NnWZzL1ZlwmolUTvX4uywLkj1h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
