In Speaking Up II, she interviews around two dozen students from a well-respected primary school in Jiangxu (near Shanghai). They are asked to express their views on different topics such as personal issues, family, gender, society, and more. Presented in a skilfully edited montage and intertwined with footage of their daily lives at school, their answers highlight the changing face of today’s China.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/50i0wxPSLezmUGf4KIDd1ynZ99o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Speaking Up 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2051615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tammy Cheung","original_name":"Tammy Cheung","popularity":0.0504,"profile_path":"/g594nVwmVcVQKHatClUPQxVdxLP.jpg","credit_id":"5b0a9c740e0a260e15006d6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/50i0wxPSLezmUGf4KIDd1ynZ99o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
