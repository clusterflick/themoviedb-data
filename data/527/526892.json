These are compilations of fan favorites--digitally remastered to be as crisp as they were in the 1950s. \"The Fan Favorites\" includes gems from the heyday of live TV, as well as interviews with writers and actors, including Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, and Neil Simon. 3-3/4 hours on 3 cassettes or 3 DVDs. Set 1 features live gut-busters from \"Your Show of Shows\" and \"Caesar's Hour\", including 18 of Caesar's own favorite sketches, plus revealing interviews with contemporaries, including Mel Brooks and Neil Simon.","popularity":0.9606,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sid Caesar Collection:  Creating the Comedy","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Woody Allen","original_name":"Woody Allen","popularity":1.372,"profile_path":"/wcPQgZLDibuej1RwNTy1R2U2ZJw.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c36c1c3a3680378002199","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Brooks","original_name":"Mel Brooks","popularity":1.5792,"profile_path":"/c21qNcMJlHnRolfhQhZOVacjtwI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c36cbc3a36803a5002034","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Caesar","original_name":"Sid Caesar","popularity":0.3597,"profile_path":"/mMSjieicMCMBK7YsQREkX7BRcB2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c36d3c3a36803820013d6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":160239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nanette Fabray","original_name":"Nanette Fabray","popularity":0.2714,"profile_path":"/6w1VAH7UHKBhovOlSfIQaRrTx9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5b0c36dfc3a368039f00186d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18267,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Larry Gelbart","original_name":"Larry Gelbart","popularity":0.2234,"profile_path":"/cR7GQsZkm9Ju4q4VMFQaftLNacF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c36e80e0a264860001cb3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Morris","original_name":"Howard Morris","popularity":0.6213,"profile_path":"/nb50cjIZX1tBzXlXGWuzihKXgPB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c36f4c3a36803780021bf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Reiner","original_name":"Carl Reiner","popularity":0.571,"profile_path":"/hNZNrwU2qysa2ijndIgkd6yjSCt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c36fd9251410761001d9e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1225413,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Danny Simon","original_name":"Danny Simon","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c37069251410741001963","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584535,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neil Simon","original_name":"Neil Simon","popularity":0.3004,"profile_path":"/qZ5iSAEcV7hCVYIOrOD4CI2J5Wi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c3714925141077c0017cc","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1227326,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mel Tolkin","original_name":"Mel Tolkin","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0c3720c3a36803900021e3","order":9}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0282969","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156203,"name":"sketch comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
