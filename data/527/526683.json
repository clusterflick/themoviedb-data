Doors Medley highlights specifically gender paradigms embedded in popular culture. From anthropology’s viewpoint, we have created drama and we also reenacted the drama we create. Popular cultural texts fine-tune specific course of events with narrative logic, which we fervently imitate to act out our daily roles. Isolated narrative fragments, as they are subject to free combination, reveal their hidden predispositions.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doors Medley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2051836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Chiu-han Lai","original_name":"Linda Chiu-han Lai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0afa739251411e0800ad31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
