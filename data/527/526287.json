The mission of many of these schools in 1950, was still to “kill the Indian and save the man.” The children were beaten, humiliated or abused if they spoke their language or expressed their culture or native identity in any way. The trauma led many to alcoholism and violence in adulthood. At age 58, Walter began writing his memoirs as a way to explain his own abusive behaviors to his estranged children, but he could not complete the project without confronting the “thick dark fog” of his past so he could heal.","popularity":0.5012,"poster_path":"/peZJcTu754dZhU8Uy6tCfmJFexe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":229115,"logo_path":null,"name":"High Valley Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Reclaiming Native American Identity","title":"The Thick Dark Fog","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Littlemoon","original_name":"Walter Littlemoon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"self","credit_id":"6178065b0d5d850065f1d595","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3482681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Yellow Horse Jr.","original_name":"Manuel Yellow Horse Jr.","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6240b8d9dd83fa008a51befd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3482682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Ferrer","original_name":"Joyce Ferrer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6240b8e981a7fc005cee4900","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3482698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Gover, Pawnee","original_name":"Kevin Gover, Pawnee","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6240bcee5f2b8d005da8fb52","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1283668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sydney Freeland","original_name":"Sydney Freeland","popularity":0.2217,"profile_path":"/rsRHq0q3saUvKCFOkeffzgmgCwC.jpg","credit_id":"617807e2a579f90090b6f73c","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1853054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Skurnik","original_name":"Jonathan Skurnik","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617805a19ee0ef004246539a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149131,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Freedman","original_name":"Paul Freedman","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617805c9cf4b8b00623cd965","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Vasquez","original_name":"Randy Vasquez","popularity":0.3438,"profile_path":"/cGepuYRa1AmIzmwC2n4IrNmFXej.jpg","credit_id":"6178057c70b4440043d79ddc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149131,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Freedman","original_name":"Paul Freedman","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617805bc9ee0ef002cf193f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285358,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Westcott (Athabascan/Yup’ik)","original_name":"Brian Westcott (Athabascan/Yup’ik)","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6178078a924ce60043a19be2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285360,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kahlil Hudson (Tlingit)","original_name":"Kahlil Hudson (Tlingit)","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617807bea579f90066330f89","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2361537","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"thickdarkfog","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":766,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/11udp8moXv30cIP6yEkFHm4035j.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1362},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qz1Vq3ot0fPH1lNAyuJoWob2Kuy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.748,"height":1443,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/peZJcTu754dZhU8Uy6tCfmJFexe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":516,"name":"child abuse"},{"id":6271,"name":"boarding school"},{"id":10322,"name":"native american"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"American Indian Film Festival -
