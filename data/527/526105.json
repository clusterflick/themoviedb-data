At age 6, he was imprisoned at a remote site in rural Cambodia. There are no records of the labour camp where Hom bore witness to a daily succession of cruelty, starvation, disease and cold blooded executions. After 33 years, Hom returns to his former homeland to shed light on Camp 32. Hom crisscrosses the country searching for survivors and leads. Frustrated and no closer to finding Camp 32, he flags a taxi to take him to his father and brother's memorial stone. What happens next will change Hom's life forever.","popularity":0.0912,"poster_path":"/78fBMz8mzr8Hz0D6jACp2Bzwdfu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camp 32","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hom Chhorn","original_name":"Hom Chhorn","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b06bc970e0a26055c00ba56","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Blogg","original_name":"Andrew Blogg","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b06bcca9251410d8600b506","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Purdie","original_name":"Tim Purdie","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b06bcde0e0a26054300b6ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4215970","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/78fBMz8mzr8Hz0D6jACp2Bzwdfu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
