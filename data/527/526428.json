She objected: \"I'm not a heroine, I'm just an ordinary person.\" The authors of the film shot Gorbanevskaya for several years, asking questions that worried her as a poet, forced them to go to the square, and how her fate developed after forced emigration from the USSR.","popularity":0.2025,"poster_path":"/oDzeRHV3BoXpdjF7XjcyQJFuHyq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sugardocs","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2016-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Natalia Gorbanevskaya: I am not a Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Natalya Gorbanevskaya: \"Ya ne geroinya\"","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2046313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalya Gorbanevskaya","original_name":"Natalya Gorbanevskaya","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/pYRKP5R7OztIwkKRIqfqfDwWX0n.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"herself","credit_id":"5b093bd30e0a267c110025f6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirill Sakharnov","original_name":"Kirill Sakharnov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lTGG3h2UQgTSYgmkxBKhCFKBUqr.jpg","credit_id":"5b093bfb0e0a267c0f00230e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1987451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kseniya Sakharnova","original_name":"Kseniya Sakharnova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ikGDLceuZIYkNsKrQWQe7IqxgSU.jpg","credit_id":"5b093c0592514146e70021d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirill Sakharnov","original_name":"Kirill Sakharnov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lTGG3h2UQgTSYgmkxBKhCFKBUqr.jpg","credit_id":"5b093be9925141470c00233f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirill Sakharnov","original_name":"Kirill Sakharnov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lTGG3h2UQgTSYgmkxBKhCFKBUqr.jpg","credit_id":"5b093bed92514146ec001b61","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1987451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kseniya Sakharnova","original_name":"Kseniya Sakharnova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ikGDLceuZIYkNsKrQWQe7IqxgSU.jpg","credit_id":"5b093c0a0e0a267c02002ae5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vYcI4AehMVI2fPmVScCgtJUlPaa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fGCI72LHvDAV5Ns1HLnF2IhDGCP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a0eFvnM4UtL6FTFZhBHT9BQbLcJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/oDzeRHV3BoXpdjF7XjcyQJFuHyq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":504}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"Sputnik Russian Film Festival","release_date":"2017-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"International Film Festival on Human Rights \"Stalker\"","release_date":"2017-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2016-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
