She is married to John, a British politician and a business man of Spanish origin, who is unable to have children. To Eva, a woman's life has no meaning if she is not a mother. A Spanish theater company is in London to perform Yerma, the play by Federico García Lorca. The Director, Victor is a friend of Eva and her husband from bygone times. A new passion is reborn between Eva and Victor and Eva has new opportunities to get pregnant. Eva's true drama is not so much that she can't have children but the impossibility, because of strict social conventions, that she can't have them out of wedlock. The real problem shown in the movie is the lack of freedoms and the imposed self-censorship in a standstill and full of conventions society.","popularity":0.5944,"poster_path":"/ArJOdLM7KsdSqKm9Il7BYH3YgD4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dark Steel Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2017-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yerma: Barren","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1248911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Grant","original_name":"Rebecca Grant","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":"/1gXZhpI5Qnr0HYbsYxtL07izKUO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5b0be0a4c3a3684b8100c914","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Díaz-Aroca","original_name":"Miriam Díaz-Aroca","popularity":0.1247,"profile_path":"/zrfsHHl21zGw6pxw3edIHVNmIXc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b0be0afc3a3684adc00df9b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2052310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mundy Rieu Jr.","original_name":"Mundy Rieu Jr.","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b0be0bec3a3684b72010c1a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2052311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Brickell","original_name":"Susan Brickell","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b0be0c90e0a260dad013ce7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1008549,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emilio Ruiz Barrachina","original_name":"Emilio Ruiz Barrachina","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0be0df9251411e81013522","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5591278","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ArJOdLM7KsdSqKm9Il7BYH3YgD4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
