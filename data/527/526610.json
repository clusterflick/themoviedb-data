A series of personal accounts and shots of the decorated interiors of apartments and houses with no hint as to where we are, no names. No stigma attached, no label given. For these are not the subject of the film, which seeks instead to give a face and a voice – a sort of private landscape – to a space that has come to represent all that is standardized and anonymous.","popularity":0.1163,"poster_path":"/gu3Cl5aTHGC3W42DxCQgLwxNkAP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Council House","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1282340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Teboul","original_name":"David Teboul","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0a826f9251411e540053ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1282340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Teboul","original_name":"David Teboul","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0a827d9251411dc5004ece","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1137551,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Antoine Parouty","original_name":"Antoine Parouty","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6011e0ed99d5c3003f579c32","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832017,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anne Baudry","original_name":"Anne Baudry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6011e0f5cb8028003f0b8d92","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1296459","wikidata_id":"Q3213574","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gu3Cl5aTHGC3W42DxCQgLwxNkAP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14632,"name":"suburb"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno","release_date":"2008-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
