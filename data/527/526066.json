The villagers used the lianas and Heaven-Ladders to climb up and down the cliffs like a monkey. They had hardly contact with the outside world until a mule-horse-trail out of the rocks in 2004. The substitute teacher Shen is the only teacher in the Gulu Primary School and has worked over 20 years. Shen would really like to become a real teacher, but he has just a middle school education. One day, the young man Bao who called himself 'Don Quixote' came to Gulu because of the lianas and Heaven-Ladders. He felt, Gulu was just his utopia. Since then Shen's fate has changed dramatically.","popularity":0.0982,"poster_path":"/lerbCcTmvaMsjI6tCgkLUFZbNaX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hongjie Xu","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Rim of the Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1432858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Min-cheol","original_name":"Wang Min-cheol","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/pRlh4O8zt9FNALwmy5XfLoHyl0b.jpg","credit_id":"63189e0c8ddc340098f70643","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049626,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rainer Nigrelli","original_name":"Rainer Nigrelli","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0658afc3a3684ca0005f06","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049630,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bin Cheng","original_name":"Bin Cheng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b065954c3a3684c8c009cf7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hongjie Xu","original_name":"Hongjie Xu","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0657f49251410d74007b7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hongjie Xu","original_name":"Hongjie Xu","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0658879251410d9f008202","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hongjie Xu","original_name":"Hongjie Xu","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0658950e0a26054300852d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049628,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frank Schreiber","original_name":"Frank Schreiber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0658fb9251410d74007be1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hongjie Xu","original_name":"Hongjie Xu","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b06580fc3a3684ca6006394","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hongjie Xu","original_name":"Hongjie Xu","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b06581f0e0a26053d0088bd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049629,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jingbo Cheng","original_name":"Jingbo Cheng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b06593b9251410d9700684e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049627,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Xi Wang","original_name":"Xi Wang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0658d6c3a3684c8900a807","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3767620","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lerbCcTmvaMsjI6tCgkLUFZbNaX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":510}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Hot Docs 2015, Toronto","release_date":"2015-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Locarno International Film Festival","release_date":"2014-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"On The Rim Of The Sky Trailer","key":"jPbm2xv89hs","published_at":"2015-05-21T12:45:47.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b0654f89251410d86007fac"}]}}}
