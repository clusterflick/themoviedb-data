They played 31 shows in 29 days and raffled off a promotional mini-van in the process, in an unprecedentedly absurd publicity stunt that raised the bar for independent artists everywhere. Exploring the furthest of reaches of Nashville’s music scene, blazing new trails in its wake, the film follows the twists and turns, triumphs and follies of all 29 days as Thelma & the Sleaze bring their raw rock 'n' roll fury through DIY spaces, art galleries, laundromats, screen printing shops, record stores, clothing shops, candy factories, roller rinks and even a McDonald’s.","popularity":0.2597,"poster_path":"/aCza2Do5uw6WsGqci7DgW69EzrX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104922,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gravy Style Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A queer feminist punk band embarks on a 31-show, 29-day 'intra-city' tour of Nashville, blazing a new trail in Music City's DIY scene.","title":"Kandyland: The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Kandyland","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Gilbert","original_name":"Lauren Gilbert","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself - Lead Singer","credit_id":"5b0699bd0e0a260556009a93","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Graves","original_name":"Seth Graves","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b069961c3a3684c9100dbbe","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Graves","original_name":"Seth Graves","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b06994d9251410db90095ec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Graves","original_name":"Seth Graves","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b06993e9251410da200ad95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049750,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Salina Hernandez","original_name":"Salina Hernandez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0699830e0a260556009a7e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6397308","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aCza2Do5uw6WsGqci7DgW69EzrX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":806}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":164734,"name":"nashville, tennessee"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Nashville Film Fest","release_date":"2017-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"KANDYLAND (2017) [Official Trailer]","key":"kScd1jYaWos","published_at":"2017-03-13T14:18:59.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b069a110e0a26053d00a7be"}]}}}
