Exploring the decades-long campaign by the Nobel Prize winner, filmmaker Maurice Fitzpatrick reveals how Hume - inspired by Martin Luther King - became the moral architect for peace in Northern Ireland.  In the Name of Peace: John Hume in America is a compelling feature documentary, narrated by Liam Neeson, with dramatic footage and stirring interviews with Presidents Clinton and Carter, US senators and congressmen, and Irish and British leaders.  Reminding us of the redemptive powers of politics to overcome division.
