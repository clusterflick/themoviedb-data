In line with these themes, the project will compose of a two-screen 35 mm film installation celebrating the quality and techniques of photochemical film. Derived from the origin of her own sister’s name, Antigone takes its starting point from the undramatized part between two of Sophocles’ three Theban plays, Oedipus Rex and Oedipus at Colonus, whose mythological character, Antigone, guides her blind and lame father, Oedipus, through the wilderness. The film will underscore the importance of film experimentation and highlight the endeavor of film, as a medium, to find a form between art, cinema and theater.","popularity":0.0791,"poster_path":"/mbsKoZhxw7BiepdCkGEjPXq1hIg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antigone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Dillane","original_name":"Stephen Dillane","popularity":0.804,"profile_path":"/qjIa6pXD4Z7nL7nH2LxyHDfxNgC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5b1d899bc3a36808860035b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1459249,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anne Carson","original_name":"Anne Carson","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/12M2QeU0FYUCViLaL9eyJm2wiHR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b1d89a8c3a36808860035be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tacita Dean","original_name":"Tacita Dean","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b1d89b092514166ab0034da","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tacita Dean","original_name":"Tacita Dean","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0c4d720e0a26483a003150","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mbsKoZhxw7BiepdCkGEjPXq1hIg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
