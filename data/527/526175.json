Since Kodachrome color processing ended in 2010 it is only possible to develop it as black-and-white negative, rather than color positive. I set up ten-second shots of different wildflowers that bloom every year in Southern California. Like the Kodachrome itself, the flowers would be drained of the color that is their primary attribute. The negative stock, fifty years past its expiration date and suffering from base degradation, was returned from the lab with no discernible image on either roll. A description of each flowerâ€™s color and structure is read by a narrator at the moment when it would have appeared on-screen. The film is a record of something that is disappearing on something that has already disappeared.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wildflowers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Honda","original_name":"Margaret Honda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b07333d9251417d0c000e2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
