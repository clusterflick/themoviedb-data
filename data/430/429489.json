For the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes living on the isolated Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, new contact with lost artifacts risks opening old wounds but also offers the possibility for healing. What Was Ours is the story of how a young journalist and a teenage powwow princess, both of the Arapaho tribe, travelled together with a Shoshone elder in search of missing artifacts in the vast archives of Chicagoâ€™s Field Museum. There they discover a treasure trove of ancestral objects, setting them on a journey to recover what has been lost and build hope for the future.","popularity":0.8247,"poster_path":"/1P2JjBEyV6ftFpG8gcOeq3e4GCQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Was Ours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2938102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jordan Dresser","original_name":"Jordan Dresser","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"636e8a1bf14dad00839a22a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3781253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philbert McLeod","original_name":"Philbert McLeod","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"636e8a492495ab0078215622","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3781256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikala SunRhodes","original_name":"Mikala SunRhodes","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"636e8a72813831008084c40f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mat Hames","original_name":"Mat Hames","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/32mE4oMvSk1H4agytxnTLKbw3TD.jpg","credit_id":"636e8bdc81383100abf5cac2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1245570,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lois Vossen","original_name":"Lois Vossen","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636e8c112495ab00782156d2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1337088,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wilson Waggoner","original_name":"Wilson Waggoner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636e8c4df14dad008dde8190","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105242,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Layton","original_name":"David Layton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636e8c60fd4f80007fb842bd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2569502,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Greg Wright","original_name":"Greg Wright","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636e8c81813831008b7bf0ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638677,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ginny Patrick","original_name":"Ginny Patrick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636e8c94ca4f67009b544f59","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638678,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sandra Guardado","original_name":"Sandra Guardado","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636e8ca5f14dad00c758155c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mat Hames","original_name":"Mat Hames","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/32mE4oMvSk1H4agytxnTLKbw3TD.jpg","credit_id":"636e8cb7ca4f67007fc2722d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mat Hames","original_name":"Mat Hames","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/32mE4oMvSk1H4agytxnTLKbw3TD.jpg","credit_id":"584a56b8c3a368141a01d903","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1245557,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sally Jo Fifer","original_name":"Sally Jo Fifer","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60024ac7326c19003e8293ad","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2938102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jordan Dresser","original_name":"Jordan Dresser","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60024ad3c99826003ea213d6","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1811836,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Ruggiero","original_name":"Chris Ruggiero","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60024adc719aeb003f44ef5f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1000854,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nathan Halpern","original_name":"Nathan Halpern","popularity":0.2,"profile_path":"/kFKPw61KwSYhmmkDsQGMv1MzYj0.jpg","credit_id":"60024af6db952d003fd52066","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2272677,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shirley K.
