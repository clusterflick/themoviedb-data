Through this and other editing techniques, Mounira Al Solh’s Paris Without a Sea questions presuppositions about gender, subjectivity, and the interview format itself. In her voiceover, Al Solh affects the accents and manners of her subjects, performing an oral drag that subtly interrogates matters of masculinity, such as the fraternity of Beiruti swimmers or the motley origins of names and nicknames as they relate to fathers and their sons.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris Without A Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mounira Al Solh","original_name":"Mounira Al Solh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"584a292c92514119bc01ad92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
