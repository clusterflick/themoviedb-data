Nearly ten years ago the two paramilitary leaders told their stories on condition that they could never be revealed while they were still alive. The stories told by the Irish Republican Army's Brendan Hughes and Ulster Volunteer Force's David Ervine tell us of the motivations of the participants, the planning of campaigns of violence, the misery of a hunger strike, the tracking and killing of informers and the duplicity that ended a conflict that had lasted too long. It is also a narrative of the fate of combatants when their wars are over.","popularity":0.3952,"poster_path":"/yEar4KnY5JRz7hnYcZyjQrDKT5Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84137,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deer Lake Films","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2010-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voices from the Grave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate O'Callaghan","original_name":"Kate O'Callaghan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58465de0c3a3684903008c0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1718794,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jordan Montminy","original_name":"Jordan Montminy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"584660f5925141676401f7d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1638037,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kate McCullough","original_name":"Kate McCullough","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":"/uWj4um22t3wX1Jj6AbLJYHK8qa6.jpg","credit_id":"584660d5c3a36844c000b311","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Farrelly","original_name":"Patrick Farrelly","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58465fe0c3a36844c000b292","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Moloney","original_name":"Ed Moloney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9e56b2c3a3687e54f20072","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1779848","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yEar4KnY5JRz7hnYcZyjQrDKT5Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":980}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7005,"name":"northern ireland"},{"id":14552,"name":"ira (irish republican army)"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":230977,"name":"the troubles (north ireland, 1966-98)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Broadcast On RTÃ‰","release_date":"2010-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
