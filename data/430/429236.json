Film-maker John Bridcut has been granted special access to the complete collection of Her Majesty's personal cin√© films, shot by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen herself, as well as by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Much of it has never been seen publicly before. Various members of the Royal Family are filmed watching this private footage and contributing their own personal insights and their memories of the woman they know both as a member of their own close family and as queen. Among those taking part are the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry, the Princess Royal, the Duke of Kent and his sister Princess Alexandra, who has never before given an interview.","popularity":0.64,"poster_path":"/sb4NPBMtAIZ1N9m7P4nOaWHMvsa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107978,"logo_path":"/uf096idcZfCzr7ZRarNt8g2Fkwk.png","name":"Crux Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elizabeth at 90: A Family Tribute","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La reina Elisabet: un homenatge familiar","type":"Catalan (TV3)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"King Charles III of the United Kingdom","original_name":"King Charles III of the United Kingdom","popularity":0.2176,"profile_path":"/9WlQBs2v4QTbA1SOrlyyPG4MdN9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self -
