He fights with all his strength, but it’s not an easy profession for youngsters. His grandfather, an authoritarian patriarch, is against Berenguer's \"misguided passion\": he only enjoys bringing home young mulato girls. An accident will knock him down. In Los Angeles, Berenguer will search for a secret buried during many years.\r Will this trip change his fate, his way of understanding the world and the land where he was born, and his own life? It will be a short and powerful emotional journey full of smiles and some tears.","popularity":0.312,"poster_path":"/3Yt4r5smU5dyq1WLLQKGi2IsNuG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2016-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh, quina joia!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Álex Casanovas","original_name":"Álex Casanovas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb456540e0a267501c16342","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Gimpera","original_name":"Teresa Gimpera","popularity":0.1836,"profile_path":"/4GyMWHQ3wLagY1Pp0wI3o56iKlU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb456600e0a2626e3ca95a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricard Farré","original_name":"Ricard Farré","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/yuxzV2ysk1G5U0XNhJXIR19IgKw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb4566a9251412fa3295e47","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josep Maria Pou","original_name":"Josep Maria Pou","popularity":0.2134,"profile_path":"/dlrkGiYFUguEBdf19CLWHF1vGCj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb456740e0a267501c1634c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Pera","original_name":"Joan Pera","popularity":0.2592,"profile_path":"/8K0leTxxFghGT2X12yHCkGCLtNM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb456849251412fb32982d1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Montserrat Carulla","original_name":"Montserrat Carulla","popularity":0.2118,"profile_path":"/dJq3gMHqhIiYEwHoKyaD7tPf7hC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb456900e0a2626e9ca2f3b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Ruiz","original_name":"Pedro Ruiz","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":"/kyfB4XVtsHgWyDkptLsua6XSdVj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"65f98b8733a3760184370611","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ventura Pons","original_name":"Ventura Pons","popularity":0.1594,"profile_path":"/i19TKCacXNLL0TUiurZswOO7aZQ.jpg","credit_id":"5cb456a192514119df212e68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5677406","wikidata_id":"Q115939924","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Yt4r5smU5dyq1WLLQKGi2IsNuG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ca","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
