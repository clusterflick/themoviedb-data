Appearing to simulate London’s CCTV surveillance system, while replicating a video game aesthetic, Lewis’ video is a slow zoom and pan of the street corner area immediately before a building. The camera’s sweep captures passers-by, traffic signage, handrails and barricades, area buildings and a bit of the street. The almost featureless modernist building centrally located in the frame is set against a row of London style tudor flats.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bricklayers Arms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Lewis","original_name":"Mark Lewis","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5849f29cc3a3681411018802","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
