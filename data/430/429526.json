Near the film's end the tram lands in Manhattan, as if it had reversed direction; as in all of Murray's films, the images and the editing can pull several ways at once. There are no absolutes, and even the light by which we see is altered by the material it passes through. â€“ Fred Camper","popularity":0.0625,"poster_path":"/3e6oI63hyUA1dyEPHDWr3TTDycX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If You Stand with Your Back to the Slowing of the Speed of Light in Water","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1600743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Murray","original_name":"Julie Murray","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/7cn5OdrBhROj5VrVBTph4XsSvnw.jpg","credit_id":"584adf1592514119b60202a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6447202","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1134,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3e6oI63hyUA1dyEPHDWr3TTDycX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
