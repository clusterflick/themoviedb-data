She has to keep her hair back more and more strongly, when finally she lets it out. As she follows her hair upwards, filled with memories, she relives the boat trips with her husband, the long walking in the sunshine among bales of hay, and she slowly understands, that her time has come to be reunited, together with her husband once more..","popularity":0.087,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12438,"logo_path":null,"name":"MOME Anim","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2012-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A love story about an old lady who relives her memories of her husband through her hair","title":"Lady with Long Hair","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":933031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilona Kassai","original_name":"Ilona Kassai","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/un4aUTKRXs3m4IW7t40vdyr62Pu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Toupee (voice)","credit_id":"5848b3f9c3a368140e00e862","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1719494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Bakos","original_name":"Barbara Bakos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5848b3a892514119b600d7cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589516,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Árpád Hermán","original_name":"Árpád Hermán","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5848b3c892514119b900d94d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2797030","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
