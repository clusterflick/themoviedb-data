Once out of the belly of their mother, Laurence, they find themselves propelled into the hostile and worrying world of the hospital, full of the sounds of machines and of doctors in white coats. As the weeks pass in the neonatal service, mother and children fight for survival. Haemorrhages, respiratory problems… Surrounded by the medical team, Laurence lives to the rhythm of the twins, caught between the hope for improvement, fatigue, the ever-present possibility that things will go wrong and the fear they will die. The bond between mother and children is organic, vital. Together, they fight fiercely for life.","popularity":0.1338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":84352,"logo_path":"/jCluvAPVwESTEP012VHYmmAPrgs.png","name":"Stenola Productions","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2016-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life to Come","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","title":"Pril Leven","type":"Dutch title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudio Capanna","original_name":"Claudio Capanna","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"584dd7e0c3a3683221003c81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721591,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christophe Evrard","original_name":"Christophe Evrard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"584dd845c3a368322a003319","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721592,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Inne Eyesermans","original_name":"Inne Eyesermans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"584dd85e92514118f0003b85","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721590,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tristan Galand","original_name":"Tristan Galand","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4bdc05223a8b0038ad39d4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6204266","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOK, Leipzig","release_date":"2016-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2016-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
