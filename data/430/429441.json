The title indicates the place and progress of the film: it is a three-minute single shot, filmed in Spadina Road in the north of Toronto. We follow the transition from a close-up to a wide shot, all with the fluidity of a long dolly shot that is carefully developed. The movement begins with a reverse dolly shot, going from details of leaves on a tree to a wide shot of an urban landscape, then zooms towards a building and ends on an image of a woman taking some fresh air on her balcony.","popularity":0.1102,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spadina: Reverse Dolly, Zoom, Nude","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Lewis","original_name":"Mark Lewis","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5849f432c3a368141a01a06a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2006-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
