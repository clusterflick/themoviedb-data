In his mouth: a red thong that definitely doesn't belong to his wife. At least that's what the former Hamburg criminalist Viola Delbrück and the Upper Lusatian loner Burkhard Schulz agree on. And also in the fact that the place where the body was found is not the crime scene. The investigation leads them to a country estate where Staffler apparently housed his lover. The trail continues to lead them to a young Polish-German couple, whose escape becomes more and more desperate the closer the two inspectors get to them.","popularity":0.3476,"poster_path":"/fvPnPaydDbgT40xVZHiWtTuuYdi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":986,"logo_path":"/qDV8nLH9pjElZSnPmg29mzzNlTo.png","name":"ARD
