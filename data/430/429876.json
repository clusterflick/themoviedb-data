As the three women negotiate the dangerous relationships among them, the seven women directors weave a sensual tale of suspense. Drawing inspiration from the poem by Jessica Wilbur and the surrealist parlour game, The Exquisite Corpse, each director selected a word or phrase on which to base her segment, and the seven chapters of the film bear their individual marks. This impressive experiment in filmmaking emerges as a sensitive tale of young desire, loss, and love's confusion.","popularity":0.4225,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brushfires","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Autumn Brooke Wilkins","original_name":"Autumn Brooke Wilkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"584dd162c3a36832210035d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1721585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candace Thompson","original_name":"Candace Thompson","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Melissa","credit_id":"584dd17b92514118de00340f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"F.
