As each battles to maintain their reality, they find increasing conflict with their beliefs. With relationships, friendships, opportunities, and survival in the balance, each must decide what to do when what they believe in simply isn't enough. Aggressive, edgy, and sometimes raw, Belief is a unique take on the quarter-life crisis, as individuals look to define themselves against a changing backdrop of adult life. With a deep plot full of twists and turns, the film ultimately challenges its audience to provide answers.
