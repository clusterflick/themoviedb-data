The characters that he meets along the way are just as colorful and complex and all take on different issues as the film deals with everything from Mental Illness and Bipolar Disorder, Borderline PD, OCPD, Antisocial PD, Histrionic PD, Narcissistic PD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Feminism, Gender equality, LGBTQ stigmas, race, coming of age and refusal of coming of
