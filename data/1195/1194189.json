The presence of women in filmmaking seldom holds the same historical notoriety as that of men, and the Pernambuco scene is no exception. In the context of \"Amor, Plástico e Barulho\" (Love, Plastic, and Noise), we find a film that serves as a testament to the marginalization of women in the creative industry, intertwining themes of consumption and the production of brega music. Hence, we use \"Feminino e Barulho\" (Feminine and Noise) as a means to share what we've learned. Renata Pinheiro has inspired us to craft a narrative that gives voice to those who need to be heard. We are here to showcase a glimpse of them and what they represent. \"Feminino e Barulho\" is a short film about love, femininity, sisterhood, and empowerment.","popularity":0.3155,"poster_path":"/6oxdgNs4gV9d9vqlmgBXUDcTgtR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2023-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feminino e Barulho","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1016242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maeve Jinkings","original_name":"Maeve Jinkings","popularity":0.3955,"profile_path":"/s1pZd8CgUIll9ALVcgtUJhsB8uF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65348e2f2b210800c74967e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piera Pilar","original_name":"Piera Pilar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65348e622b2108013f5a7f85","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Liberato","original_name":"Leo Liberato","popularity":0.0293,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sérgio","credit_id":"65348e8f2b2108013f5a7fa2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Ururahy","original_name":"Luca Ururahy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Luca","credit_id":"65348e99abdafc012da911a3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4332823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernardo Guimarães","original_name":"Bernardo Guimarães","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bernardo","credit_id":"65348ea68cfcc700aa0264e8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4332825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Pedro Tavares","original_name":"João Pedro Tavares","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jgFB02lawaVbbYOdjMGGz6xMHsS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"João","credit_id":"65348eb48cfcc700c83db81d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4332825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Pedro Tavares","original_name":"João Pedro Tavares","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jgFB02lawaVbbYOdjMGGz6xMHsS.jpg","credit_id":"65348ef48cfcc7010af5d70f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4332823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernardo Guimarães","original_name":"Bernardo Guimarães","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653492c4c14fee0100e94eb8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Ururahy","original_name":"Luca Ururahy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65348ee3c14fee013a4cdd37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4332823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernardo Guimarães","original_name":"Bernardo Guimarães","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65348effc14fee0100e94cce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4332825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Pedro Tavares","original_name":"João Pedro Tavares","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jgFB02lawaVbbYOdjMGGz6xMHsS.jpg","credit_id":"653492d6c8a5ac00fff9ec5c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4332825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Pedro Tavares","original_name":"João Pedro Tavares","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jgFB02lawaVbbYOdjMGGz6xMHsS.jpg","credit_id":"657875077a3c5200ebfe50a8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4332823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernardo Guimarães","original_name":"Bernardo Guimarães","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6578751920ecaf00c699ce34","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/6oxdgNs4gV9d9vqlmgBXUDcTgtR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/2rB6twOhN52xeUYw1o1mRUuGHAG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":171468,"name":"femininity"},{"id":185059,"name":"brazilian music"},{"id":250808,"name":"brazilian northeast"},{"id":298721,"name":"women"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
