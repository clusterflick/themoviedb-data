Determined, Nina pulls her friend into the empty restaurant anyway, surprising the devastated owner, Shantu. As they sit, another stunned patron enters- Mark. When it quickly becomes apparent that Mark is a dedicated Trump voter, a slanderous argument between Jess and Mark ensues. Ultimately, Jess, Mark, and Nina find that they must get over their misconceptions of each other and come together for the common good: they transform the message of hate into a positive Hindu blessing, not only for their friend, but for their community.","popularity":0.2142,"poster_path":"/r7eA6Ir5JfSYpOQyCv2ExVdzmFK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Working Lunch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1616492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachael Perrell Fosket","original_name":"Rachael Perrell Fosket","popularity":0.143,"profile_path":"/5NDV4zLePU3euu5Cokbyh42MiXH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6534168142d83700eac59be6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ari Montgomery","original_name":"Ari Montgomery","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65341688abdafc014e7d3669","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4332185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Schuyler","original_name":"Peter Schuyler","popularity":0.0432,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"653416942b210800ff843e94","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanjeev Trika","original_name":"Sanjeev Trika","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6534169ba0be28011cbb2681","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801131,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shilpa Sunthankar","original_name":"Shilpa Sunthankar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65341661c14fee0100e92080","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6974054","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r7eA6Ir5JfSYpOQyCv2ExVdzmFK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
