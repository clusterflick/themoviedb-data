This will uncover their perspectives of what it means living in the Town, a city that’s ever-changing – from memories, dreams, home, and resiliency. Like a mixtape, SYNCHRONIZED amalgamates their voices, natural landscape sounds, and unconventional Oakland imagery to encapsulate a unique representation that acknowledges how the personal and environment coexist together. Inspired by Godfrey Reggio's 1982 film, Koyaanisqatsi, this film was produced during the COVID-19 pandemic and features voices from BIPOC LGBTQ+ Oakland residents along with beautiful takes of Oakland’s changing urban landscape.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/e7WCCoJLLKN98F0rpvMQVD3t6nP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Synchronized","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Corinne Manabat Cueva","original_name":"Corinne Manabat Cueva","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65348653a0be2800fff799c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Corinne Manabat Cueva","original_name":"Corinne Manabat Cueva","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6534867ba0be2800e23865d5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14128336","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e7WCCoJLLKN98F0rpvMQVD3t6nP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
