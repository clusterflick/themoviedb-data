Sir Bobby was a key member of the England team that won the World Cup in 1966 and a Manchester United team touched by success and tragedy in equal measure. Charlton survived the Munich air disaster in 1958, which killed several of his teammates, dubbed the Busby Babes. He became a crucial figure in the club's resurgence, winning two league titles and, unforgettably in 1968, the European Cup against Benfica.  He received a knighthood in 1994 and was awarded the prestigious BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008. A fiercely proud Englishman, Charlton was a pivotal figure at Manchester United as an ambassador, club director and close confidante of a succession of managers.","popularity":1.1334,"poster_path":"/fUruoO2tVfNUZfeLOvdjGpxap2F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary celebrating the remarkable life of one of England's greatest-ever footballers, Sir Bobby Charlton.","title":"Sir Bobby Charlton: The First Gentleman Of Football","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Beckham","original_name":"David Beckham","popularity":1.3071,"profile_path":"/9MOY95jds58WtvEwUTYZgXlTVr0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"653566d22b2108011ddfc99e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éric Cantona","original_name":"Éric Cantona","popularity":0.6633,"profile_path":"/lMIXZd1QiHH7Y5emujCKGnRh6np.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"653566f7c14fee00ad9e72af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Rooney","original_name":"Wayne Rooney","popularity":0.2631,"profile_path":"/pIUmu6SkoZpF5wT96mx0cEtyv2N.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6535670691f0ea00c422e9f4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1141893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Ferguson","original_name":"Alex Ferguson","popularity":0.2996,"profile_path":"/zzRldIXzQohouEzbXxcyJQDoFnM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6535671f8cfcc7012b4012dc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoff Hurst","original_name":"Geoff Hurst","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/t46LUriZNL4WfBK9RBstg2fl2kA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"653567328cfcc7010af63de6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Charlton","original_name":"Bobby Charlton","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":"/lREC342d7fGXvfYpCHJR2Mdu699.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6535674391f0ea00ac5d8186","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1924234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Law","original_name":"Denis Law","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":"/aMCou0KDmGlm1EUzhz3itYYofGY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65356761abdafc012da9774d","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4y7UIwHK2r8rqQVMOnxF1956J7z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qRvNJM4f2O3BQVA5KSDW8LbOzgB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fUruoO2tVfNUZfeLOvdjGpxap2F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sir Bobby Charlton Interview | Full | History Of Football","key":"mjwc7M75mI8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2016-02-09T10:58:55.000Z","id":"675cd0afd0b2f1868d1afa2f"}]}}}
