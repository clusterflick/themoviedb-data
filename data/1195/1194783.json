Even now, Zeki Müren continues to have a profound influence on Turkish society and on the Turkish people. 'Zeki Müren Hotline' is a cross-platform documentary that collects and curates people’s messages about Turkey’s beloved queer pop star, through a simple telephone line and an interactive web experience. Callers participate in a collective meditation on and around Müren, often expressing nostalgia for the deceased icon and Turkey’s bygone days.","popularity":0.0356,"poster_path":"/yBqhJZWQZOuSBoVFbOBblJg35AE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zeki Müren Hotline","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4333780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beyza Boyacioglu","original_name":"Beyza Boyacioglu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65356247c8a5ac00e2b75573","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4333781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Soyk","original_name":"Jeff Soyk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6535624f2b210800ff84c2a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4333780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beyza Boyacioglu","original_name":"Beyza Boyacioglu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6535628f8cfcc7014c8e0242","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4333781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Soyk","original_name":"Jeff Soyk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6535629891f0ea00c422e8c0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4333780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beyza Boyacioglu","original_name":"Beyza Boyacioglu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653562a7c8a5ac0139ab110a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4333781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Soyk","original_name":"Jeff Soyk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653562b3abdafc012da975f1","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6474600","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yBqhJZWQZOuSBoVFbOBblJg35AE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
