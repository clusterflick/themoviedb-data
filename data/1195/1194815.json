Burszstyn goes from the Spanish city of Cordoba to Fes in Morocco, then onwards to Egypt and finally, Israel. In the course of this physical, geographical journey, Bursztyn also does a deep dive into Maimonides’s 12th century canonical work, The Guide for the Perplexed, which he uses as a tool to interpret present-day events and the conflicts between faith and rationale, and between religion, culture, and gender.","popularity":0.2489,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Guide for the Perplexed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"'מורה נבוכים'","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1733552,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rami Katzav","original_name":"Rami Katzav","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653574d702842000c59bd98e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4333957,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yair Dalal","original_name":"Yair Dalal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65357573c8a5ac00c50a4eb0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Igal Bursztyn","original_name":"Igal Bursztyn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6535744aabdafc00eb8c847a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Igal Bursztyn","original_name":"Igal Bursztyn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65357383c14fee00ad9e7675","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Igal Bursztyn","original_name":"Igal Bursztyn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65357366abdafc00acf81702","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Igal Bursztyn","original_name":"Igal Bursztyn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65357471c14fee00c6ee47ee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1129262,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Era Lapid","original_name":"Era Lapid","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653574858cfcc700aa02d685","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563835,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gil Toren","original_name":"Gil Toren","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653575ef8cfcc7012b401779","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0814128","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"},{"id":186849,"name":"literary adaptation"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":321414,"name":"religions"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
