It's also a film about confused people seeking love, acceptance, and happiness. Tim, a quiet and depressed young man with a secret looks after King, his mysterious wheelchair-bound benefactor. Much to Tim's dismay, King constantly seeks to explore his most explicit and disturbing desires. Through King's exploits Tim meets Izzy, a young woman with her own troubles who offers Tim some hope for the future.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love/Sick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4653476","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
