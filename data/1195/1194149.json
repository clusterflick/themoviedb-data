'This is Victor and me six months ago', she comments in the voice-over. 'What has changed in the meantime? Not much. Apart form the fact that a nasty habit of mine has reared its head.' Marijn Frank is jealous and, she admits, extremely suspicious. She has the annoying inclination to search for dubious messages on her boyfriend's cell phone. While filming Victor when he is checking his text messages, she invariably asks him who sent them. What if she would secretly glance through his inbox? Or would that constitute an invasion of his privacy? Sometimes she muses in front of the camera, other times in the voice-over, or talking to her lover. Is she the only person having this problem?","popularity":0.0696,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":47251,"logo_path":"/bL1c2INFMGR8XceGU8MO4y8EB7F.png","name":"IDTV Docs","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2008-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De verleiding - Mobieltje","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4331843,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Willemien van Aalst","original_name":"Willemien van Aalst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6533cffaa0be2800c5685b11","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303730,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Suzanne van Voorst","original_name":"Suzanne van Voorst","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6533d004c8a5ac00e2b696bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4331846,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mascha Wiggelman","original_name":"Mascha Wiggelman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6533d00fa0be2800e2382211","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marijn Frank","original_name":"Marijn Frank","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/1MPM9y1UQtJYGrlIjT3eNDBopqF.jpg","credit_id":"6533cff0a0be280139a24e48","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591386,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Axel Skovdal Roelofs","original_name":"Axel Skovdal Roelofs","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6533d01b42d83700c93ec935","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marijn Frank","original_name":"Marijn Frank","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/1MPM9y1UQtJYGrlIjT3eNDBopqF.jpg","credit_id":"6533cfe1abdafc00acf775b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
