The relationship that the protagonist, Juliana, builds with Ananke mirrors the abusive relationship that one can have with substance abuse, where the euphoria is so dazzling it replaces ambition and independence. In the short film, we explore how one, who suffers from a lack of support and loneliness, can give away everything to feel wholesome. The film explores addiction within LGBTQ+ communities.","popularity":0.0763,"poster_path":"/pFUCs94YUV29C0npNzIhQ3VWEqi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The moment they met it was intoxication","title":"Ananke","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4268728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hemma Gulhane","original_name":"Hemma Gulhane","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"653476b6abdafc00cac3720c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Feride","original_name":"Feride","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"653476bdc8a5ac00ac38d313","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3804913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Wight","original_name":"Cameron Wight","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"653476d02b210800ae52165d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Kate Steven","original_name":"Melissa Kate Steven","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4zzBb2YM48drbR7UCnnKbbtXFdP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"653476d78cfcc700c83daaa8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caitlyn Calfas","original_name":"Caitlyn Calfas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"653476e442d837014db8ec7e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Macnaughton","original_name":"Ian Macnaughton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"653476faabdafc010c29257c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Walsh","original_name":"Chris Walsh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6534770c2b210800c7495a76","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebekah Bosworth","original_name":"Rebekah Bosworth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65347717a0be2800fff79132","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Bennet-Moore","original_name":"Joshua Bennet-Moore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"653477202b210800c7495a8c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Letelier","original_name":"Caroline Letelier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6534772d2b210800e23c615d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heather Lewis","original_name":"Heather Lewis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"65347738c14fee013a4ccf6c","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Barinoff","original_name":"Catherine Barinoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653476a642d837014db8ec4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3214008","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pFUCs94YUV29C0npNzIhQ3VWEqi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
