Unsure of what to do next - undergo a high risk treatment or simply end his own life - he reluctantly decides to return to the isolated family home he has just inherited. Returning to the old house dredges up good and bad memories of his estranged twin brother, Robby, but also forces him to recall the abusive relationship he had with his father, also a cancer sufferer who ended his life by suicide - in the very same house. Completely alone, James soon begins to hear and see strange things around the house. Is it hallucinations caused by a tumor and too many pain killers, or is it really a ghost? James will have to confront the force that occupies the house and his own personal demons.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark St The Top Of The Stairs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dark At The Top Of The Stairs - Feature Film Teaser Trailer 1","key":"mx_Q2NOzc8Q","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-16T21:44:03.000Z","id":"653452d291f0ea00e1aafe47"}]}}}
