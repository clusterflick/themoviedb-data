The inhabitants of this archaic society are religious harvesters of a fungus called \"Shpongle\" which is consumed through many forms and connects its users to a fantastical world of which they are both the builders and hosts. We follow these wayward characters out of their respective \"hives\" and into this strange realm; a fantasy world disclosed in a series of elaborate (and increasingly horrifying) fairy-tale narratives. Between these two realms, we witness the recurrent seeding, harvesting, and extraction of Shpongle, which simultaneously powers and strangles the city.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/84FE3mzyHR4v7l8XKRCVGHDVBED.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chronicles of Shpongle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9391166","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/84FE3mzyHR4v7l8XKRCVGHDVBED.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/62Kq4FwAb0LavWIYffFJnYE8eOJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
