OUTRAVE explores the connections between 2SLGBTQ+ people and electronic music, from the origins of house to today's massive global rave culture. In the pilot episode of OUTRAVE, host Denise Benson - DJ, author, and music historian - speaks with queer pioneers and contemporary shining stars of Toronto's vibrant rave scene. Chippy Nonstop, Karim Olen Ash, Cozmic Cat, Aeryn Pfaff, James St. Bass, Deko-ze, and DJ Chiclet share their takes on the significance of social space and the magic of queer and trans creativity. We're here, we're queer, we're creating our own parties. All while adding glitter and good to the broader rave culture.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/1LXeDmeQnszWodUgh22umSTBxZ3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's
