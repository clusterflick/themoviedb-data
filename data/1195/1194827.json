The competition is a landmark of the Buenos Aires nightlife since many artists take their first steps there, having the opportunity to share the stage with established figures in front of a fierce audience and a jury of notables. At the same time that the different stages of the contest are recorded, following the emotional pulse of each participant, the film reflects and narrates a brief history of local drag, invoking and summoning figures that built myths in the night.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":"/fTXZ5XbgtsOiigVrbDOdNFlpHFE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2023-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darlo todo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4333958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germán \"Tano\" Nieto","original_name":"Germán \"Tano\" Nieto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65357626028420013aaf656a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4333958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germán \"Tano\" Nieto","original_name":"Germán \"Tano\" Nieto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654cfacb29383501387d6368","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4069890,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sebastián Frota","original_name":"Sebastián Frota","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654cfaec5a5ed000c6ad0d30","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4333958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germán \"Tano\" Nieto","original_name":"Germán \"Tano\" Nieto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654cfadc67b61300e5dd0eca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dVLTzrzUxa9LZt1HFIOOg19h6Al.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/fTXZ5XbgtsOiigVrbDOdNFlpHFE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Asterisco","release_date":"2023-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
