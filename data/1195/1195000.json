I chose the path of creativity, chose to manifest myself through music. I discovered my gift, talent. I want to dig deep and understand — is there the same sound that started the process? \"The Sound that Opened Me Up\" is a short documentary about three artists who are at the beginning of their creative journey, Erika Lundmoen, the Settlers group and the Margosha group. The singing of birds, the sound of a chewed film in the player or the ocean crashing on the rocks. The heroes shared their personal stories about their formation and told what kind of sound launched their creativity.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jlH4LOWz73QTlLVUXpZvwmVAruC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2023-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sound That Discovered Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4334858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oganes Eknosyan","original_name":"Oganes Eknosyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65361cac8cfcc7012b407cad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2143012,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ilya Gryzenko","original_name":"Ilya Gryzenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536804ac8a5ac00e2b804cd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335312,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ivan Zheltov","original_name":"Ivan Zheltov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6536806aabdafc010c2a35de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1036,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jlH4LOWz73QTlLVUXpZvwmVAruC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":691},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1036,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ltFr79mrggqcIa7R0uHa8FRAEsu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":691}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
