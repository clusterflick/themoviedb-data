So when their mom sees it at home in a pile of papers and asks if they wrote everything on the paper, the middle schooler responds with yes, not remembering that what they wrote would out them in one of the dumbest ways possible, with the pun “not as straight as this line” on top of a straight line. The middle schooler then has to deal with this unexpected situation and goes to a place of comfort in order to sort their thoughts and come to terms with being out to their mom before they were ready.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vxf3RGCWq2O8qJchUVqhIsNx8YR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not as Straight as This Line","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marigny Adelman","original_name":"Marigny Adelman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65343ff58cfcc7010af5af19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vxf3RGCWq2O8qJchUVqhIsNx8YR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1012}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Twin Cities Film Fest","release_date":"2023-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
