Her son Goldie keeps her active beyond her energy level. Her husband Jack owns a large ad agency and has been a loving husband who has recently expanded his romantic life beyond his marriage to include co-worker Maeve...who happens to be the ex-partner of his sister-in-law Lena. Lena is a burgeoning music writer who, getting over a break-up, takes on an assignment writing about one of her favorite queer indie artists, Mia Hawthorne. Mia is out in the Berkshires, in search of inspiration, a bit frustrated with a high-class problem: the record label wants her to have a co-writer. The mundane poetry of life ensues.","popularity":0.3389,"poster_path":"/4wdHdTRNcp6XoKR7WkOL8ssKU2s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186051,"logo_path":"/nDrmmLOHOJQkCWNq9cjxfJ1gdHf.png","name":"The Balas Brothers","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A trip in the woods towards love","title":"Midwinter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Rose Gold","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":4059259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Chiang","original_name":"Josephine Chiang","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Maeve","credit_id":"653569362b210800ae527ad1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia D'Angelo","original_name":"Julia D'Angelo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mia Hawthorne","credit_id":"6535693d2b210800ae527ad7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3163461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlowe  Holden","original_name":"Marlowe  Holden","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nadine Andrews","credit_id":"6535694842d837010ba9330e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4333849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chadwick Sutton","original_name":"Chadwick Sutton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jack","credit_id":"6535695042d837012c76ec0e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":3639518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Traisman","original_name":"Charlie Traisman","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/naY9oZHfgLxBvXOpR3o9rSLWILM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lena Andrews","credit_id":"6535695802842000ffb58cbb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2285396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maggie Alexander","original_name":"Maggie Alexander","popularity":0.3103,"profile_path":"/q074aaVNB4bRJ9p9Fj8evBDwbfi.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Doctor Ross","credit_id":"6631ac4bdd2589012b2dbf2f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian George Randles","original_name":"Brian George Randles","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mr. Jokes","credit_id":"6631ac62ad59b501286c78ab","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1304761,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Andrew Balas","original_name":"Ryan Andrew Balas","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/t0AJMmk1cEfjIOnZHFba8LYEFLN.jpg","credit_id":"653569222b210800ae527aca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1304761,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Andrew Balas","original_name":"Ryan Andrew Balas","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/t0AJMmk1cEfjIOnZHFba8LYEFLN.jpg","credit_id":"6687088dcd7144ae2958b0ac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28711135","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cAEay2wjMEeZHxugGlaSjKSfMeO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tI90i5jhGRr6PB4V68idNPgVqZ6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2248,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4wdHdTRNcp6XoKR7WkOL8ssKU2s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1499}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
