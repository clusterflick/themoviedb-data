Ross Uwen and his crew are on a mission to get young people involved in politics by any means possible which politicians and other organisations are consistently failing at. Believing that televised news is a great way to become politically educated they try to devise a plan to get young adults watching the news by combining it with adult softcore material to entice viewers to tune in regularly and therefore becoming politically aware and potentially engaged. When you run out of traditional methods you've got to think outside the box and that's what Getting Involved is all about.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/ayWQYnvWj1dfjlfoS7ddWeKXnaM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Getting Involved","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3902462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Milne","original_name":"Ross Milne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ross Uwen","credit_id":"63db856ca5743d00ce380c22","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3902473,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ray O'Connell","original_name":"Ray O'Connell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63db8764a5743d00ce380cee","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3902462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Milne","original_name":"Ross Milne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63db86c285702e05480e509f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3580001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brett C.
