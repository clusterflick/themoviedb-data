Thousands of people have seen and heard what they believe to be phantom footsteps, abnormal phenomena, and ghosts of all shapes and sizes, sometimes even moving above ground level.

The film ranges from a haunted house, a haunted inn, even a theatre haunted by a butterfly - to Borley Church where many strange occurrences have been recorded.","popularity":0.0459,"poster_path":"/iFi8Rmsq0YovgHRl34puUrHsu7U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1975-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ghost Hunters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Croom-Hollingsworth","original_name":"Geoffrey Croom-Hollingsworth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63dac59c9e458600b4cf4cf9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Underwood","original_name":"Peter Underwood","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63dac5a6a9117f007f21f8be","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504907,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Hugh Burnett","original_name":"Hugh Burnett","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dac733955c65008c7c53ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7201414","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iFi8Rmsq0YovgHRl34puUrHsu7U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":935}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
