Set against the backdrop of the filmmaker's quixotic quest to build an ark in a field in Maine, the film heads far afield - to salt mines in the Alps, fjords in the Arctic, and ancient libraries in the Sahara - to illuminate the strange world of archives, record-keeping, and memory.","popularity":0.8113,"poster_path":"/txlwRKlc1MiOnPp0sHrnB6JAEyX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sandbox
