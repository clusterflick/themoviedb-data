In the video \"Abell 2877\" she deals on different levels with the similarities that can be found in the emotional and social attributions towards both the depths of the oceans and outer space, and for this she makes use of elements of repetition and sound modulation. In this way, she attempts to direct the viewer's attention to the perspectival ambivalence, situativity, and transience as well as the inadequacy of undifferentiated, human meaning-making.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abell 2877 – Asoka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3903236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kai Hellebrandt","original_name":"Kai Hellebrandt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dc26bad40d4c009ddbb08b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
