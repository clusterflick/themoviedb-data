Obviously, a film is, first and foremost, a document, a testimony of the world that surrounds us. The rich expressional possibilities of film are based on the imperfection of the human eye, its sluggishness, so thanks to the stroboscopic effect we can animate a still image. Film is therefore a kinetic image, or a moving image. It can make the invisible visible, bring the distant closer, enlarge the small, speed up the slow, slow down the fast, and return the end to the beginning. The technological basis of film: light, film tape, camera, projector, film screen. Expressive possibilities of film: scientific, documentary, communicative, artistic. Basic film genres: differences among films.","popularity":0.267,"poster_path":"/3CVXDGof5AM1gnjCsWDU29gjFqe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20915,"logo_path":"/g0ZgDi0m0RubOnoUFYaHsa8M5To.png","name":"Hrvatska Radiotelevizija","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":5724,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zagreb Film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Introduction to Filmmaking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087028,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ante Peterlić","original_name":"Ante Peterlić","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/3fpTdaaeJtQcpLsiZ2mj7vvQPIB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"63da5bbfa6c104008587aa9e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1556163,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ivan Hetrich","original_name":"Ivan Hetrich","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Survey conductor","credit_id":"63da5bf3a6c10400d4caa052","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308713,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Duško Jeričević","original_name":"Duško Jeričević","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63da5cc4a6c104007c072796","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901051,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Todor Dedić","original_name":"Todor Dedić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63da5d61a6c104007f63a1f8","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901043,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mirjana Trumbetaš","original_name":"Mirjana Trumbetaš","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63da5b80955c65008c7c2f01","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901049,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Oto Zake","original_name":"Oto Zake","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63da5cf93dc313009df1dadc","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1880878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zlatko Sudović","original_name":"Zlatko Sudović","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qQn1Gg6D8APKyDg20DnsbCttMhI.jpg","credit_id":"63da594585702e05753c5d87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1880878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zlatko Sudović","original_name":"Zlatko Sudović","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qQn1Gg6D8APKyDg20DnsbCttMhI.jpg","credit_id":"63da595b955c6500a84335d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901050,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mladen Šiklić","original_name":"Mladen Šiklić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63da5d34a9117f00797762df","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901052,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jasna Fulgosi","original_name":"Jasna Fulgosi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63da5d9c955c6500847b5415","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901047,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Zvonko Durbešić","original_name":"Zvonko Durbešić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63da5cdaa9117f00b2ece225","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087028,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ante Peterlić","original_name":"Ante Peterlić","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/3fpTdaaeJtQcpLsiZ2mj7vvQPIB.jpg","credit_id":"63da5950955c65008c7c2e6f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3CVXDGof5AM1gnjCsWDU29gjFqe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":222228,"name":"cinema history"},{"id":312368,"name":"film theory"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hr","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
