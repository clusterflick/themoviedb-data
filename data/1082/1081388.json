Every time he sees an attractive woman, he gets a nosebleed. His long-suffering mother Meng Jie (Samantha Ko) is worried that his lust will get the better of him, and that he will end up getting a woman pregnant. But his life is changed on the day he decides to seek out baking lessons from Mary (June), a baking teacher who is 15 years older than him – and also happens to be a friend of his mother. Mary is wary of Johnny’s affections, and thinks that a relationship between them would be totally inappropriate. But Cupid has other plans for them. Eventually, she finds that fighting her feelings is a fruitless struggle – and finds herself seriously beginning on a romance with the younger man. But things take a turn when Johnny must go abroad to Italy to study. And then the situation gets extremely awkward when Johnny’s stunned mother learns of Mary’s love for her son.","popularity":0.2655,"poster_path":"/gfUFtF5mqLYfd948FEpgecJYIib.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Mary Met Johnny","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1614456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Liao","original_name":"廖亦崟","popularity":0.2073,"profile_path":"/qpfIlUVdqYDVIdIb6389anZfMsu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Johnny","credit_id":"63da9f79955c65007bac0696","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2481446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Tsai","original_name":"六月","popularity":0.3767,"profile_path":"/igUm0YPOjv1E7UCgDCQrhK4FUoJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"63daa156955c6500a84351fb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2171708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ko Shu-Chin","original_name":"柯淑勤","popularity":0.2159,"profile_path":"/6kHqPUSHMwVpZ4p1qAwPmB91vFv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Meng Jie","credit_id":"64d5d239bf31f201ca8b5a55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1089570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chang Han","original_name":"張翰","popularity":0.3447,"profile_path":"/jroxa0xd9OXRrPBNr9UCap4Nezl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63daa1cea6c104007f63bb1a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":570507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crystal Lin","original_name":"Crystal Lin","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/2rIWo4LvZnuzpMSV9FXRZMefGnH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63daa20f955c6500a8435242","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1497813,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Li Ding","original_name":"Li Ding","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/olWNhxkeKufMC9ohJAiAIQy435k.jpg","credit_id":"63da9ea6a6c104008587c3ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gfUFtF5mqLYfd948FEpgecJYIib.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1191,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/nCfY9NgFjdbj0TRt1Nnt48sGbm8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":794}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
