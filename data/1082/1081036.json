Great natural beauty clashes with manufactured outdoorsmanship, as a tired body and sluggish mind seek the oblivion of hotel hospitality in an arid region of artistic aspirations. The viewer is introduced to a world of prickly plants and satin-skinned succubi who prowl the alleys of western decay to staple their fig leaflets on the vertical shafts that poke unsheathed at the virgin skies of southern Arizona. The sheaths are administered, and the population prepares for cinematic coupling in a city park earmarked for culture. Enter the masculine caves that spilled forth their glittering guts onto a surface world as desperate for gems as it was for water. Witness this natural spectacle all packaged and delivered in the form of a vacation video, and marvel at the mavens of movie-making as they bombard the public with a cacophony of celluloid under the moonlit, desert sky.","popularity":0.0678,"poster_path":"/enEIF98PvHieuhmCyrSAFoUQV2u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arizona Byways","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63d96c8fa6c10400ab1ffbbd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1959089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Barten","original_name":"Rebecca Barten","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63d96ca822df2e008cca49d7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","credit_id":"63d96ce83dc3130082334073","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0454394","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/enEIF98PvHieuhmCyrSAFoUQV2u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
