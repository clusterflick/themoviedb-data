With such, we propose a new constellation of technologies through a narration on vulnerability. Tools to destroy and disappear, but also to expand and nourish.  A homage to the symbolic link in a drop of water and a late-night DM; a soaked jacket coming back home and trying to resuscitate a phone in rice.  The film was created through a back-to-back dialogue between \"makers\". Itâ€™s a research on writing and filming, and simultaneously on affection and subjectivity. It was filmed in Super-8 and 16mm film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Might Go and Throw My Phone Into The Lake, Yeah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucia Vives","original_name":"Lucia Vives","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f576b77dfda600792b88cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3933297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Fuentes","original_name":"Sam Fuentes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f576c29bcd0f00a9fedc4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
