In 1924, a visionary South African, Sol Plaatje, set out to bring the wonders of cinema to the community. Brandishing a few educational 16mm films under his arm, Plaatje arrives in a dusty, Blacks-only township in the Western Transvaal. He is looking for a venue which can be set up as a bioscope. Things do not seem promising, but Plaatje is first befriended by a helpful young boy. And then, despite prevailing apartheid obstacles, a room is found. The township community is excited and set to be overawed by the new celluloid world about to unfold before them.","popularity":0.0872,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1994-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Come see the bioscope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":211947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Ndhlovu","original_name":"Ernest Ndhlovu","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Sol Plaatje","credit_id":"63dbde4bd40d4c0081727593","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3905575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simanga Nhlapo","original_name":"Simanga Nhlapo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Mmusi","credit_id":"63de82e2e55937009ffe1b4e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3905576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Ramokagdi","original_name":"Deborah Ramokagdi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Mma Salepo","credit_id":"63de830d6ee3d7008573c416","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3905577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdul Sadek","original_name":"Abdul Sadek","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Mohammed","credit_id":"63de832b6ee3d7008573c42b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712142,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catharina Weinek","original_name":"Catharina Weinek","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dbdbbdd5ffcb00799770fa","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827962,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kevin Montanari","original_name":"Kevin Montanari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dbdc950cb33500d399e0a2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323126,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Leon van der Merwe","original_name":"Leon van der Merwe","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dbdcd210923000f04d9fe7","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13084,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lance Gewer","original_name":"Lance Gewer","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dbdb9b25a536008fba469d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3902915,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Didi Kriel","original_name":"Didi Kriel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dbdcc225a53600878ed983","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3902933,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beverley Green","original_name":"Beverley Green","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dbde0ad5ffcb00c61fdd49","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13084,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lance Gewer","original_name":"Lance Gewer","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dbdc83d40d4c0085470f10","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3902910,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Newman","original_name":"Mark Newman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dbdc5610923000982300d9","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3862622,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Micki Stroucken","original_name":"Micki Stroucken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dbdbd8d5ffcb00e6da3bbc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267633,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lloyd Ross","original_name":"Lloyd Ross","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dbdcac0cb335007e11c7dd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
