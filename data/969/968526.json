Following strategies of structural film making, 16mm plays with the footage roll used to film it as constitutive base of its form and content. A 16 mm film standard roll of 200 feet (60.96 meters) gives an approximate duration of 5' 33\" (333\"). That means 1 meter of film is consumed every 5.46 seconds or 18.3 cm. every second.","popularity":0.0542,"poster_path":"/v2SyfboPagEgnyzumcmrR82G9NY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"16mm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3153269,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Steegmann Mangrané","original_name":"Daniel Steegmann Mangrané","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6269ed40b7a1540051365431","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":968,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v2SyfboPagEgnyzumcmrR82G9NY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":645}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
