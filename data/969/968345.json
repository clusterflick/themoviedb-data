Rolands Kalniņš, one of the great masters of Latvian cinema, sits down to have his photo taken and looks straight in the lens. Kalniņš’ life has spanned an authoritarian regime, a world war, long years under Soviet occupation and censorship, and retirement in independent Latvia. His films have been censored, destroyed, found and restored. But here, like Herz Frank once did with a child, for ten minutes we shall observe the micro-emotions of a man who has dedicated his life to film. Confronted directly by the tool of his trade, the camera. As we face Kalniņš eye to eye, we hear the sounds of his present, and the memories of his past.","popularity":0.0822,"poster_path":"/la2y8AaA0n0I0iV2w5BktSKDGJ2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82814,"logo_path":"/kqoYsJ1mEpsVbggNSk6Ms2pTLa2.png","name":"Trickster Pictures","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2022-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Hundred Years Older","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolands Kalnins","original_name":"Rolands Kalniņš","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/tphisfJrIloU2w1AnA7DUCUOsUs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6269717b001bbd154b2d1dda","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agita Cāne-Ķīle","original_name":"Agita Cāne-Ķīle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6269711f614c6d009ab83bf7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2941883,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daira Āboliņa","original_name":"Daira Āboliņa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6269712ec613ce005032e086","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1105426,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matīss Kaža","original_name":"Matīss Kaža","popularity":0.1522,"profile_path":"/gOKxbIW0cJJyIiZrnT7iOxXWtX5.jpg","credit_id":"6269715cc613ce005032e18d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566705,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrejs Rudzāts","original_name":"Andrejs Rudzāts","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62697169158c8535c1a25a8d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1105426,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matīss Kaža","original_name":"Matīss Kaža","popularity":0.1522,"profile_path":"/gOKxbIW0cJJyIiZrnT7iOxXWtX5.jpg","credit_id":"6287b4b3209f1812c62b31b4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20355390","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c9v4otpQopoMfhY9ESONCsUdBCk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/la2y8AaA0n0I0iV2w5BktSKDGJ2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
