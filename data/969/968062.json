Then the question of an abortion arises. The absence of a reciprocal desire causes a heavy and untrue behavior. They are practically two puppets. But one day something special happens in their life. A new existence starts, based on a more careful attention of the one for the other. The search of a love' s desire finally becomes credible and needed. And day by day the two rediscover themselves and learn how to really love each other.","popularity":0.3844,"poster_path":"/zGpck2sSSGZcNEtji0pSo9PcoyN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La ragion pura","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleonora Brigliadori","original_name":"Eleonora Brigliadori","popularity":0.3619,"profile_path":"/vCgcGsm3QoXuTZVUxy9C8isYEii.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"62688f93924ce600504d858f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Nero","original_name":"Franco Nero","popularity":1.2366,"profile_path":"/uiCrTolkOqpZYVxveMZeBx7sjZO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marito","credit_id":"62688f9b9f37b00066e5d289","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvano Agosti","original_name":"Silvano Agosti","popularity":0.2216,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62688fa79f37b00066e5d302","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1259,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ennio Morricone","original_name":"Ennio Morricone","popularity":0.412,"profile_path":"/avjgzi45bdXgC1AtyNsRc5nxtFM.jpg","credit_id":"62688fae7cffda004f6c725f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvano Agosti","original_name":"Silvano Agosti","popularity":0.2216,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62688fb612aabc0051694ac0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvano Agosti","original_name":"Silvano Agosti","popularity":0.2216,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62688fc24ccc50004ff6d010","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvano Agosti","original_name":"Silvano Agosti","popularity":0.2216,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62688fca7cffda004f6c72ca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3525072,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Patrizia Gallo","original_name":"Patrizia Gallo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62688fda4ccc50009cb44d16","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0308791","wikidata_id":"Q3823827","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zGpck2sSSGZcNEtji0pSo9PcoyN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
