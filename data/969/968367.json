She is convinced that the crisis that France has been experiencing since the beginning of the pandemic is more political than sanitary. Sonia founded the Blouses Blanches, a collective working for fundamental freedoms, and is opposed to the mandatory and systematic vaccination of caregivers and children. From her point of view, both have been sacrificed on the altar of the pandemic. For several months, Maga and Ariakina Ettori met with scientists, doctors and politicians in order to understand what this health crisis reveals about our health system, our society, our collective values and our democracy. A balanced and nuanced journalistic investigation.","popularity":0.1297,"poster_path":"/r9sR4tBE77RpddgFjuoR8BZNVpp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les enfants de la liberté","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3526241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariakina Ettori","original_name":"Ariakina Ettori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6269808c1f98d1009adc37e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2228421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magà Ettori","original_name":"Magà Ettori","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6269809712aabc00a6e7376f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2228421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magà Ettori","original_name":"Magà Ettori","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626980a364f716160e708520","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q112752860","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":1220,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/r9sR4tBE77RpddgFjuoR8BZNVpp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":916}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
