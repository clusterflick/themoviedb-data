Waiting For Cambodia features interviews and discussions with a variety of citizens, many of who represent a face of change and hope, and many who remain dedicated to the Khmer Rouge ideology. Images of cultural beauty are displayed through ritualistic dance and song, serving as a powerful accompaniment to the rough images of conflict. The attempts to regain culture, individual rights, and freedom are prevalent themes within the film, and footage of Cambodian relief camps and liberation organizations are displayed as efforts of change.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waiting for Cambodia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3525143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shari Robertson","original_name":"Shari Robertson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6268b521fea0d7009cf92f23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3525144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David A.
