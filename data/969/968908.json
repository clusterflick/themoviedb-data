Alongside them were Jóhann Páll Valdimarsson, publisher and the Cadillac expert Steini í Svissinum. The trip gave them the inspiration to write a book about the trip which came out in the fall of 2006. Alot happened on this trip and the publisher Jóhann Páll wanted to write a book with the title: How to survive a mad trip with four insane guys. The book could be used for teaching in psychiatric studies.","popularity":0.3043,"poster_path":"/uuu4taLwXDJEIEwajQcgl2YlBAp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Úti að aka - Á reykspúandi kadilakk yfir Ameríku","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":128698,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Einar Kárason","original_name":"Einar Kárason","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Einar Kárason","credit_id":"626b47c4931ea1006f3243ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3528156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ólafur Gunnarsson","original_name":"Ólafur Gunnarsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"626b482f0c0b38006705093c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sveinn M.
