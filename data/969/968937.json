Worshipped by millions of devotees in the border regions of southern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, and adjacent areas of India, this fertility goddess is best known through media representations and social activism protesting practices linked to sexuality and prostitution. Her musical and social traditions have parallels in the devadasi (women dedicated to male deities) system in Tamilnadu before its reform and classicization in the early twentieth century. The film attempts to balance the typically negative representations of the tradition, which tend to focus on controversial practices and to exclude the unique musical forms essential to the worship of the goddess Renuka/Yellamma.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music for a Goddess","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3528223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amy Catlin-Jairazbhoy","original_name":"Amy Catlin-Jairazbhoy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626b59bccdbaff004f492156","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3528220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nazir Ali Jairazbhoy","original_name":"Nazir Ali Jairazbhoy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626b5964a410c800520fc678","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
