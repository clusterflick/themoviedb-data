After their deaths, it became the photo book with the greatest international projection of all time and this film is a tribute to the work of these two figures, which is now 100 years old.","popularity":0.1364,"poster_path":"/lPXxis0B9LVtdYy0uLFF684X9wl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156789,"logo_path":null,"name":"NewTalks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lisbon, Sad and Happy City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1723038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Trabulo","original_name":"João Trabulo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626b3992439be1004f6f1bc6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3528136,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Miguel Mendes de Carvalho","original_name":"Miguel Mendes de Carvalho","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626b39abdc1cb400a0c103ef","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1723038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Trabulo","original_name":"João Trabulo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626b39c30ed2ab01825d2b35","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20603328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3G2A5gskQzaufaS5N9Y1bDkDMBo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1778}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/lPXxis0B9LVtdYy0uLFF684X9wl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1902,"name":"lisbon, portugal"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
