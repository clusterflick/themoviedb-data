They are just over 40 cm tall. They were originally drawn by the Belgian cartoonist Peyo, but Hanna-Barbera Productions later made a popular TV show about them that Laddi voiced in Icelandic. The Adventures of the Smurfs first appeared as sequels in the cartoon magazine Sval but were immediately published in book form.","popularity":0.1285,"poster_path":"/kvZN1gkP7Ps5xkicXHTcl5M1pic.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smurfs 9","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Þórhallur Sigurðsson","original_name":"Þórhallur Sigurðsson","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/dDCwBRJBzsoGd0pNWUqg29WRPYF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"voice","credit_id":"626b0aca489d000068230b7c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Þórhallur Sigurðsson","original_name":"Þórhallur Sigurðsson","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/dDCwBRJBzsoGd0pNWUqg29WRPYF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"main","credit_id":"626b0af8394a8700a21b34d4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225594,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peyo","original_name":"Peyo","popularity":0.4258,"profile_path":"/hwbIS9WXXXy3vZYcd1BaBSLHX7k.jpg","credit_id":"644ad4e5596a9105a5576459","department":"Writing","job":"Comic Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225594,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peyo","original_name":"Peyo","popularity":0.4258,"profile_path":"/hwbIS9WXXXy3vZYcd1BaBSLHX7k.jpg","credit_id":"644ad4ff596a91054d5764ae","department":"Writing","job":"Characters"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kvZN1gkP7Ps5xkicXHTcl5M1pic.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2EvjW0i8cOp19h5tnnS7oFUBXoP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
