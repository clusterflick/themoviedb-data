The video looks at the early years of 1939-1940 when the force suffered huge losses, through to 1941 when they began to possess the means of victory. In 1942 they developed new tactics and new aircraft and by 1943, with the use of the Pathfinder Force, they were making 1,000 bomber raids on Germany and for the next two years the Nazis reaped the 'Whirlwind' that 'Bomber Harris' had promised them.  By 1945 they had destroyed most of Germany's towns and cities and broken the morale of the population.","popularity":0.1801,"poster_path":"/ABvCtby8MGuITpr2hn2PMqUglo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pegasus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bomber Command: 1939-1945","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2348726,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joanne Garofalo","original_name":"Joanne Garofalo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62693b339f37b00066e7b33a","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3525829,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Buckley","original_name":"John Buckley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62693b6064f716160f8f41ea","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Garofalo","original_name":"Robert Garofalo","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/bALY1FrqhjMtAaldxMd4frVzz33.jpg","credit_id":"62693bc21967570051a43097","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3525830,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Dunne","original_name":"Michael Dunne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62693b7c001bbd154a98d8ad","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Garofalo","original_name":"Robert Garofalo","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/bALY1FrqhjMtAaldxMd4frVzz33.jpg","credit_id":"62693ba6001bbd154a98d904","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Garofalo","original_name":"Robert Garofalo","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/bALY1FrqhjMtAaldxMd4frVzz33.jpg","credit_id":"62693bc94ccc50009cb62463","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574010,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lyn Beardsall","original_name":"Lyn Beardsall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62693b97f92532162336a2d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uuVBs8wmq0abBTHwVfLsYeYWzRs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":840,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ABvCtby8MGuITpr2hn2PMqUglo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Copyright was 2002","release_date":"2002-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
