His best friend WEI Zhuoping is the director of the orphanage, and although he has a heart of gold, his character is very weak and afraid of trouble. At first, Wei Zhuo Ping refused to buy the land as a warehouse for his smuggled goods, but he was forced to give in because he had the control in the hands of Jin Huan Wu.  Without the orphanage, the poor children were once again on the streets. Yin Zhaoshi was furious when he learned of this. The warehouse was sealed and the orphanage was returned to Wei Zhuo Ping's hands, but Jin Huanwu felt that it was the work of Yin Zhaoshi who was responsible for his failure and vowed to take revenge.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9sMQ4v9P48LjGlQ4UZi8VvBNdxz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bright Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1103,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9sMQ4v9P48LjGlQ4UZi8VvBNdxz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":781}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
