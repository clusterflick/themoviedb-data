Unlike card magic, which focuses on illusions, cardistry has grown into its own art form, with a dedicated community that continues to push its boundaries. Though it shares roots with magic, it has developed into something unique over time. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the journey.","popularity":0.8275,"poster_path":"/etRRCeEaRrtUktMtmPHS9tjxmD8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Cardistry Documentary","title":"Out of the Box","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Buck","original_name":"Dave Buck","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6707d212d0616c7b19fb65e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4850244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Buck","original_name":"Dan Buck","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6707d2251d96dc6d476a3254","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4991952,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Jung","original_name":"Max Jung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6707d204c92c2e56d8615c6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/etRRCeEaRrtUktMtmPHS9tjxmD8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Ovc9yxMGCMnjLV7dj9XyG9RcK.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rd5lfT3HsgGUVPi6YKC1OAJ5iYZ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2343,"name":"magic"},{"id":287885,"name":"cardistry"},{"id":287886,"name":"playing cards"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cardistry's Story of Skilled Card Shuffling | Documentary","key":"KyiqfCNZOh4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2024-10-06T21:00:17.000Z","id":"6707d1bb6718012fc233c01a"}]}}}
