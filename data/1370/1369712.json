A harmonious matrimony of image and sound, this anti-film serves as retrospective of his family's history, personal failures and rejections, his on-going independent experimental filmmaking career, a reflection of his ongoing scrimmage against a mental illness, and an optimistic glimpse of his coming days. BAKLAYCORE is not cinema, it's Nikko Martinez's life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/o5adLcEFruT8h6L6JeygWyEUAXc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baklaycore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikko Martinez","original_name":"Nikko Martinez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67092cee265a5f8bc570c046","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o5adLcEFruT8h6L6JeygWyEUAXc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":539}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
