Their obsession with vampire role-playing games leads them to decide to become vampires and get revenge on a world that doesn't understand them. Unfortunately for them, it takes a bit more than cheap Halloween makeup to scare people, so their attempts just lead to even more ridicule and physical harm. But that all changes when they discover a dealer of the occult named Maxwell Selwyn who can give them want they want: a potion that will turn them both into vampires. They fork over the money and sure enough, their dream comes true. They set out to finally get revenge on the world that rejected them... only to find they were better off with the cheap makeup.","popularity":0.0863,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raising the Stakes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lloyd Kaufman","original_name":"Lloyd Kaufman","popularity":0.5372,"profile_path":"/4jNIqeZBK2YbpPupBhl4l1moQn5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Floyd Faukman","credit_id":"6709682d22f7254ed396307d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Dyszel","original_name":"Richard Dyszel","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/3NnxkjyA5EXNr0P7SZL8v74Yl6N.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Union Vampire","credit_id":"67096841b0c4f7a5361a28c1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1526622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Channell","original_name":"Justin Channell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670967e8e1db9ec4862e86d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1526622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Channell","original_name":"Justin Channell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670967eeb68d4f70e0ab36a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1526622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Channell","original_name":"Justin Channell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670967f7b68d4f70e0ab36a8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0446767","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
