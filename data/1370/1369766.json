At 13, Duncan Major met artist Tara Bryan and discovered a shared passion for letterpress printing that shaped his life. In her memory, Duncan created Imprint, a poetic animated film that serves as a heartfelt tribute. Using the letterpress and craft material she passed down to him, the film brings hand-printed art to life with vibrant animation, evocative imagery and a beautifully designed soundscape. Imprint celebrates how the relationships we build echo outward, leaving an enduring legacy.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/k1RTpog0m6uXm8a6nnuDTNGbiJD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2025-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imprint","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2680725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duncan Major","original_name":"Duncan Major","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6709437ed357a2103996e2c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k1RTpog0m6uXm8a6nnuDTNGbiJD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/vdMeIUHwcMWLRTrfsq8pLr9inrX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
