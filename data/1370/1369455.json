They made a video game.  The Great Game traces how both men rose to the tops of their fields following World War II, before falling out of favor with their respectives agencies — on opposite sides of the Iron Curtain. For Kalugin, a growing discontent with the KGB’s treatment of Russians radicalized him against the institution. Meanwhile William Colby, an OSS operative and the CIA’s man on the ground in Vietnam, was fired by President Ford after testifying before Congress about controversial CIA programs like MKULTRA and CoIntelPro.  After the fall of the Berlin Wall, both living on American soil, Colby and Kalugin played themselves in Spycraft, a multi-million dollar game that was among the most advanced of its time — and is now almost entirely forgotten.","popularity":0.6092,"poster_path":"/mx0FmxmXMzH4Bb3c6MCpwzkMkOw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91439,"logo_path":"/cO8qk69dFUET0oKEL8WGf3E1vYa.png","name":"Polygon","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In 1995, former KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin and ex-CIA Director William Colby collaborated in an unexpected way.
