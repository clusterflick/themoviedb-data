Kepes, a professor at MIT, founded the Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS) in 1967 to facilitate the intersection between art, science and technology.  The film, though silent, features Kepes speaking at a seminar. It includes title cards towards the beginning, including one introducing Gyorgy Kepes and another showing a brochure for a symposium accompanying the exhibition in January 1966. It also includes close-ups of Kepes’ influential books, including editions in a variety of languages.","popularity":0.0668,"poster_path":"/8LpFL7D7iTtMmMmgmNngeb0t7DY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gyorgy Kepes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4995190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"György Kepes","original_name":"György Kepes","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/91qxsa0ecipEcGyojZpJL3rL8rq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6709df44cf9915920374c032","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4198697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Eidlitz","original_name":"Frank Eidlitz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iWsT0d7a9cidKR1WBzYl5WlqSKH.jpg","credit_id":"6709df55cf9915920374c054","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4198697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Eidlitz","original_name":"Frank Eidlitz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iWsT0d7a9cidKR1WBzYl5WlqSKH.jpg","credit_id":"6709df5ccf9915920374c05a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LpFL7D7iTtMmMmgmNngeb0t7DY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Frank Eidlitz Collection: Gyorgy Kepes","key":"H-nIPS_w7J8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-05-30T05:58:23.000Z","id":"6709dfac576497fbd05a45a2"}]}}}
