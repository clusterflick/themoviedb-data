The animation drew inspiration from iconic pop culture references, including the chase in JAWS and the playful antics between Tom and Jerry. The sound was designed by Alex George and nods to Henry Mancini’s theme for The Pink Panther. The animation’s goal was to combine a timeless narrative using classic 2D animation techniques and attentive craftsmanship. Through this work, Nim aimed to showcase her artistic vision while staying true to the essence of traditional animation.","popularity":0.0605,"poster_path":"/r6st0Ki9cvzEGw4q99KkJIJZIUc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Claws","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nim Longley","original_name":"Nim Longley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670927a06adf662021303847","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r6st0Ki9cvzEGw4q99KkJIJZIUc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
