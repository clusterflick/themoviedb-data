The crane operator and longshoreman seem to have disappeared. In this \"forgotten space\" of the ocean (that channels 90% of global trade), their absence, along with the grime and buzz of the port city has been mourned, there have been requiems. But they exist, countless of them, their hand-eye and body workings, rendered tiny and near-invisible against the backdrop of the lego-land image of the container port. CAMP's work here, filmed on location at the Zhuhai International Container Terminal, Gaolan on the Pearl River Delta offers \"a day in the life of\" look at what can be seen; of both the systems-view and workers-view of that seemingly automated movement of boxes.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":154160,"logo_path":null,"name":"CAMP","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men-At-Work with Boxes in Stereo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
