Having already produced specials with Comedy Central and Netflix, Paul goes for a more grassroots approach to his newest collection of material. Not having to worry about the industry red-tape or pleasing suits behind a desk, Paul gives a no-holds-barred, “anything goes” performance that fans and peers alike are calling his best work yet. Filmed at the Den Theatre in Chicago, IL.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/dWmVdpPMnfam5YpWQajcTEV8JBy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paul Virzi: Reasonsable Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2142035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Virzi","original_name":"Paul Virzi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/715NZ3thKLsVADznoRCh5bqIccK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67075201d0616c7b19fb26ca","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33780797","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1373,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dWmVdpPMnfam5YpWQajcTEV8JBy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":915}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
