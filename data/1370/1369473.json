Known for his work with legendary photographers like Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson, Morris was instrumental in shaping the way iconic historical moments were visually documented.  The film centers on Morris’s decision to publish 11 frames from Capa’s D-Day photographs, which became some of the most significant images of World War II. Directed by Michelle and Olivier Richard, the documentary blends interviews, archival footage, and personal reflections to capture Morris’s profound impact on photojournalism, his ethical approach to imagery, and the emotional weight of curating war photographs.  John G. Morris: Eleven Frames offers a compelling glimpse into the life of a man whose editorial choices helped shape public perception of world events.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/oE5w78qglBCgHskxZFUdxypgHow.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John G.
