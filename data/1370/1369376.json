As Lin says himself, the final part marks the climax of the trilogy, because it corresponds to the completely detached, free and highly abstract forms of “spontaneous” calligraphy. The performance contains elements of Tai Chi and is musically accompanied by compositions by Jim Shum and Liang Chun-mei. The performance was recorded in 2009 at the National Theater in Taipei, Taiwan.","popularity":0.0897,"poster_path":"/jxIqco8VxpLZp5Xxbd985avHXP4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Cursive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1485704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lin Hwai-min","original_name":"Lin Hwai-min","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6708304b200b5388b5566060","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jxIqco8VxpLZp5Xxbd985avHXP4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"行草 Cursive","key":"G-km7hyaqCE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-04-25T10:36:02.000Z","id":"670830d2200b5388b55660ca"}]}}}
