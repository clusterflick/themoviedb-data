Images in color and black+white are super-imposed from two 16mm projectors.  One projector plays a 5 minute color film; this film is played forwards and backwards, continually being re-threaded â€“ we see writing and un-writing, painting and un-painting.  The second projector screens a series of writing actions on various surfaces; on rock, on paper, in negative and in revealed invisible writing separated by black intervals. During the performance these two superimposed projections create a flow of repeating actions: creating and uncreating, writing and erasure, color and blackness. The sound is created live by the performer through manipulation of a hand cranked cassette machine, contact mics, guitar pick-ups, looper and percussive machines. The text is read intermittently through the performance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/cugq3iDUowskVnfQ1IkP1JdSqUP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Goes Without Saying","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1441095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg Pope","original_name":"Greg Pope","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6709923e84af55cc1eafa9ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cugq3iDUowskVnfQ1IkP1JdSqUP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
