The result is a pulsing, meditational, almost tribal film containing lurid colors and dense, finger paint-like qualities. In a sense, the video is closer to what Iâ€™d intended when I made the original black-and-white film and follows the same Rimbaud-esque disordering of the senses.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qKbLnaL12gZg54XTgBvXIyQWlD6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alchemy of the Word (Altered Video Version)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1352411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter von Ziegesar","original_name":"Peter von Ziegesar","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ikT3JKkIX3YMIi1maslyvJ5u3N5.jpg","credit_id":"67085905f18919dd4c482f0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1352411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter von Ziegesar","original_name":"Peter von Ziegesar","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ikT3JKkIX3YMIi1maslyvJ5u3N5.jpg","credit_id":"672c1982898d18e69095ebab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nveEdZ9QALw1izGZJFO6MOHO7Oo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qKbLnaL12gZg54XTgBvXIyQWlD6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
