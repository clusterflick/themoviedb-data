The director thus tracks down all the still visible traces of the insurrectional movement, in the South Pacific but especially in Paris, by following Alain Dalotel, author of numerous works on the Commune (and who died on May 29, 2020 in Bagnolet). He also tracks down all the archives, allowing us to understand, with the means of communication and information of the time (and with a voice-over by Bernard Langlois), what contemporaries experienced between March and May 1871: their hopes, their dreams, their fears, their anger.","popularity":0.3957,"poster_path":"/ifgDKkhqRXx92oO4WxW4IrozBlk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mémoires Vives productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Commune de Paris 1871","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4395159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Langlois","original_name":"Bernard Langlois","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/jkv6mcphMVtpJylv58VIyLa5LNT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"670929a0d357a2103996d552","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3336756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Medhi Lallaoui","original_name":"Mehdi Lallaoui","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/vTjJnGJ0hYDLrX18J8OTHusxEjd.jpg","credit_id":"67092780d357a2103996d519","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3336756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Medhi Lallaoui","original_name":"Mehdi Lallaoui","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/vTjJnGJ0hYDLrX18J8OTHusxEjd.jpg","credit_id":"670927856adf662021303828","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2081665,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Pierre Guillerez","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Guillerez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67092922d357a2103996d527","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2878140,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stéphane Kayler","original_name":"Stéphane Kayler","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6709292f8d487f6541289177","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115292,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Antoine Laviolle","original_name":"Antoine Laviolle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6709293b265a5f8bc570be33","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7858994","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z5yAOnCSvTpYtXpaoJYIQ750KjR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ifgDKkhqRXx92oO4WxW4IrozBlk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4319,"name":"french revolution"},{"id":252314,"name":"revolutionaries"},{"id":314761,"name":"communist movement"},{"id":339646,"name":"commune de paris"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
