These were some of the titles that the mainstream media attributed to filmmaker Ken Loach and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Now, they are destroying some of these old myths to change the narrative. The documentary addresses media bias, defamation and censorship, and exposes the mechanisms of the establishment and the British mainstream press, revealing how they exploit fear and discrimination to defame individuals, their ideas and the project they represent. But these tactics are not limited to the UK: the film draws parallels with other parts of the world, including the United States, Brazil and other European countries.","popularity":0.064,"poster_path":"/cyYNjx55O7oSvWi96WvNcQpR9xM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bad Patriots","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3526654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Fraga","original_name":"Victor Fraga","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67094aac265a5f8bc570cec0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3526654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Fraga","original_name":"Victor Fraga","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67094ab48d487f654128a27e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3526654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Fraga","original_name":"Victor Fraga","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67094ad38d487f654128a298","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4810677,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Giulio Amendolagine","original_name":"Giulio Amendolagine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67094ae3d357a2103996e5b8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2859947,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Valnei Nunes","original_name":"Valnei Nunes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67094aef8d487f654128a2a6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33968248","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cyYNjx55O7oSvWi96WvNcQpR9xM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"48th SP Film Fest","release_date":"2024-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
