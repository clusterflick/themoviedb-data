Her laptop sits on a shoebox, in the privacy of her home she finds first lines and harmonies: “I like to be alone,” one song begins. One by one, musicians join her. Intuitive ideas take shape. A window has opened. Arrangements, rehearsals, recordings follow. Step by step, the music enters public space, images are produced, videos, narratives. Questions arise: New beginning or back to the roots? New Biedermeier or tough political comment? The bigger the band, the riskier the booking. The more crisis-ridden the environment, the more comforting the music-making.","popularity":0.4007,"poster_path":"/rpkvo3HnyfJeV4jNC0wQIHSD8Eh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barbara Morgenstern – Doing It for Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1545558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabine Herpich","original_name":"Sabine Herpich","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6707e041e46a12a1941a35bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1545558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabine Herpich","original_name":"Sabine Herpich","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6707e052d0616c7b19fb6cda","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1545558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabine Herpich","original_name":"Sabine Herpich","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6707e05ce46a12a1941a35d1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1545558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabine Herpich","original_name":"Sabine Herpich","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6707e06cd0616c7b19fb6ce1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1796354,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tobias Büchner","original_name":"Tobias Büchner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6707e077e46a12a1941a35e4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873692,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dominik Avenwedde","original_name":"Dominik Avenwedde","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6707e0871d96dc6d476a37f2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873692,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dominik Avenwedde","original_name":"Dominik Avenwedde","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6707e09ad0616c7b19fb6d0f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1796354,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tobias Büchner","original_name":"Tobias Büchner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6707e0b3200b5388b5563975","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4hkF7VCOUS3mCkb0MyVORYgKesS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lvJ8xmQHsCslYC8nOl0Kmq5Lgdx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/rpkvo3HnyfJeV4jNC0wQIHSD8Eh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":989}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220,"name":"berlin, germany"},{"id":41388,"name":"portrait"},{"id":190608,"name":"music production"},{"id":251433,"name":"elektro pop"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
