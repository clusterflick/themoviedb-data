Shot across three separate road trips, the film blends visual poetry with intimate monologues in multiple languages, reflecting the fragmented nature of the protagonist’s life.  The film’s segments—Leaving Amman, Scrambled Eggs, and Postcards to a Friend—explore themes of love, loss, and freedom. The first segment, set in Amman, presents a conflicted relationship with home, inspired by Charles Bukowski’s Let It Enfold You. The second, in French, revisits past romances, while the third, narrated in Kazakh and Urdu, contemplates departure and longing. Through dreamlike cinematography and raw reflections, The Road captures the bittersweet beauty of transient nature of life and self-discovery.","popularity":0.0585,"poster_path":"/cUBE3scvlqaWiSk4d6DApG9IlT0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"},{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Road","title":"The Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dilara Mustapina","original_name":"Dilara Mustapina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"670911a38d487f65412885a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yemeen Khalid","original_name":"Yemeen Khalid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"670911cc265a5f8bc570b14f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jude Hammoudeh","original_name":"Jude Hammoudeh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"670911d6265a5f8bc570b166","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahamoud Traore","original_name":"Mahamoud Traore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"670911ee6adf662021302f7a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jana Hammoudeh","original_name":"Jana Hammoudeh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67090e346adf662021302d27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jana Hammoudeh","original_name":"Jana Hammoudeh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67090e4ad357a2103996c777","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cUBE3scvlqaWiSk4d6DApG9IlT0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Road (trailer)","key":"1018648292","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-10-11T11:58:13.000Z","id":"6709135dc5fcf5a1634f6f87"}]}}}
