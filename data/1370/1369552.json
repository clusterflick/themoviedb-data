Eunsol, granddaughter of the once-renowned pansori master Park Manchun, has silently guarded this place, becoming like a relic of the past herself. Eunsol, who occasionally performs pansori for tourists, one day finds herself singing along to beats produced by Sijung, a hip-hop musician of similar age who has secretly snuck into the hall. This musical encounter gives Eunsol conviction that it might be the only hope to save the memorial hall from its impending closure.","popularity":0.1395,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":128371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bada Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2024-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beatmaker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2834863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Jun-hyung","original_name":"Kim Jun-hyung","popularity":0.167,"profile_path":"/qTM5GmhUrFSG6y1Urw2JTpstuk6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"672b23dc425bdcd2ace350ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4696184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Go Do-eun","original_name":"Go Do-eun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/lvlO0gK2Qhs5CAAihzr9iRLJF3U.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"672b23e5425bdcd2ace350b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5043501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"kaogaii","original_name":"가오가이","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/owvz9LhMRxrxesrQGRJEIpzNPg1.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"672b240950e15e8f5a583f6d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1696022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"An Min-young","original_name":"An Min-young","popularity":0.3602,"profile_path":"/mLweJKWvz4CGP5l2GSYI3MHKbmv.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"672b2412425bdcd2ace350c2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5043503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Si-bon","original_name":"Park Si-bon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"672b24205508209cf7ad1ca5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4999401,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shin In-kee","original_name":"Shin In-kee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670cc0194111be4f02750147","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4999401,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shin In-kee","original_name":"Shin In-kee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670cc0271ca4c39fdeeb7b2e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2685827,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Yu Young-jong","original_name":"유영종","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670cc0623bb4557c669bf53f","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1669101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ko Eun-ki","original_name":"고은기","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/dE5GhAtPCvkjFW7Qu46wFZGijfp.jpg","credit_id":"670cc077f58a9206aa4148a3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Jeong-jung","original_name":"Kim Jeong-jung","popularity":0.0694,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670cc088f58a9206aa4148ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2529301,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lee Do-hyun","original_name":"Lee Do-hyun","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672b23aa60f5b9ecdff07a0d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ALL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul Independent Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
