It is a story revolving around Aubrey, a young student who suffers from an undiagnosed condition and family issues, who later meets Miaâ€”a young girl who she slowly trusts and builds a relationship with. Will this blooming relationship be for the better or worse?  It is a horror-thriller with a mix of mystery and drama that will surely make the viewers question the film's whole lesson, message, and importance in today's society. It embodies a first-person point-of-view to make the audience think they are also involved in the film.  Was it real?
