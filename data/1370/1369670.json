He talks about his first steps on the dancefloor and the tough path into his dancing career, his great successes and also the many setbacks, his decisions and valuable experiences. Taking responsibility has always been one of his core values and has taken him to the world's great show stages, made him a national coach and helped him to be part of the team that took the dance sport of “Breaking” to the Olympic Games.  Director Julian Heinke accompanied the still active dancer on his travels and shows him from exciting angles as well as on unpublished video material from his active time.","popularity":0.1528,"poster_path":"/9gTcHJNyR3quQntWPY88mgOIiLk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"A 30 Year Celebration","title":"Patrick Grigo: Spotlight, Backstage & In Between","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Grigo","original_name":"Patrick Grigo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"67090ebcee9614858724ca92","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Grigo","original_name":"Diana Grigo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"herself","credit_id":"67090ece8d487f6541288387","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1100752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niels \"Storm\" Robitzky","original_name":"Niels \"Storm\" Robitzky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"himself","credit_id":"67092fd5c5fcf5a1634f7c57","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katrin Gaggl","original_name":"Katrin Gaggl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"herself","credit_id":"67092ff0d357a2103996d705","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4318873,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniela Hüttner","original_name":"Daniela Hüttner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"herself","credit_id":"67092ffbd357a2103996d713","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tobias Winkler","original_name":"Tobias Winkler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"himself","credit_id":"67093025ee9614858724db5b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Woschitz","original_name":"Christopher Woschitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"himself","credit_id":"67093040d357a2103996d74d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4993966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitta Luisa Merki","original_name":"Brigitta Luisa Merki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"herself","credit_id":"670930628d487f65412893f1","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4317462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Heinke","original_name":"Julian Heinke","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/uceDROfduEaXSKNmav2O8pmaGJw.jpg","credit_id":"67090ee96adf662021302d60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4317462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Heinke","original_name":"Julian Heinke","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/uceDROfduEaXSKNmav2O8pmaGJw.jpg","credit_id":"67090ef2d357a2103996c85d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4317462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Heinke","original_name":"Julian Heinke","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/uceDROfduEaXSKNmav2O8pmaGJw.jpg","credit_id":"67090efc6adf662021302d74","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cJEHrzic19ZIP9c7QKKTFHLYAhh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tHVVux8XRxFc20yrjc1kadj9l2O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/9gTcHJNyR3quQntWPY88mgOIiLk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":898,"name":"hip-hop"},{"id":8338,"name":"coach"},{"id":33934,"name":"choreographer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
