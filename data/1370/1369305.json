The bitter feud between Tim Nicholas and his identical twin, Todd, was only resolved when Tim shot Todd through the heart. Identical twins, John and Bill Reiff eat together, sleep together, work together, and have known no other relationship throughout their adult lives. These are just two of the extraordinary personal stories that are uncovered during Thomas' journey through the private lives of twins; a journey that ends with a remarkable discovery.","popularity":0.1116,"poster_path":"/hmnixb5vHXZ8s56SgCYUqhQT3Uw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Extraordinary Lives Of Identical Twins","title":"Twins: The Divided Self","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Body doubles; The Twin Experience","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4992164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Schappell","original_name":"George Schappell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self (as Reba Schappell)","credit_id":"67080114e46a12a1941a4673","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1228447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lori Schappell","original_name":"Lori Schappell","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"67080122d0616c7b19fb7c60","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antony Thomas","original_name":"Antony Thomas","popularity":0.0815,"profile_path":"/fOywBou7Sv5kQBpZkJyccC5bT4i.jpg","credit_id":"670d1e2c9f3531e6b26be505","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hmnixb5vHXZ8s56SgCYUqhQT3Uw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Twins: The Divided Self","key":"b21zmDlzsEI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-05-12T16:00:19.000Z","id":"6708013ee46a12a1941a468e"}]}}}
