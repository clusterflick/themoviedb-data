Marilyn Monroe dies under mysterious circumstances. How did she die? The police report states: probable suicide. But there are many things that point to murder: a corpse draped too beautifully, an investigation that was cut short, evidence that disappeared. Plus Marilyn's affairs with the then US President John F. Kennedy and his brother Bobby.  What really happened on that fateful summer night? After her housekeeper discovers the body, six hours pass before the police are called. She finds a beautifully draped corpse, sleeping pills in the blood but no pill residue in the stomach, witnesses who seem uncertain. The first investigator thinks about murder - and is taken off the case. Today no police files can be found.","popularity":0.9166,"poster_path":"/eJr8e79HWDTlFRQwcZmPrxVSScc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19797,"logo_path":null,"name":"Raphaela Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":195307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Preview Release GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":73716,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palm Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":196807,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walgroove Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marilyn Monroe: Death of an Icon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marilyn Monroe","original_name":"Marilyn Monroe","popularity":1.0136,"profile_path":"/9lwUFj9zV6C7qYeWSR7UhWXt0uY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"642590f9960cde009a96516c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John F.
