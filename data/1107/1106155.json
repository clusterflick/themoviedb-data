Incorporating dance, animation, and re-enactments, the film, directed by queer filmmakers and artists, imagines the lost identities of the models used for Parisian sculptor Georges Gardet​’s work Eternal Youth. From hermetic Greco-Roman cult to two-spirited heritage, this film, told from the filmmakers’ point of view, offers a unique perspective on Winnipeg’s famous mascot as seen from a rent-controlled building.","popularity":0.1329,"poster_path":"/wz30BPHi4Rut7cmLLokdJcrcNpL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Purple
