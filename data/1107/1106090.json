With sharp humor and sincere vulnerability, Nickerson dives into the absurdities of pandemic homeschooling, generational shifts in parenting, social media-induced stress, and his own self-admitted immaturity. Balancing witty observations with genuine emotional honesty, he captures the chaos of raising kids with anxiety, ADHD, and ODD—all while humorously grappling with his own shortcomings. Runs in the Family masterfully finds laughter in life's toughest moments, reminding us that sometimes the best remedy for family dysfunction is simply to laugh through it together.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":"/vv3IFbyYA8JcSwgdVMHszqKRvSm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102561,"logo_path":null,"name":"An Independent Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dustin Nickerson: Runs in the Family","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3264130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dustin Nickerson","original_name":"Dustin Nickerson","popularity":0.1288,"profile_path":"/wcCMtgi6Gq2F7NqSr04eORyQcbC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6423b2266905fb00bd0898ec","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3264130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dustin Nickerson","original_name":"Dustin Nickerson","popularity":0.1288,"profile_path":"/wcCMtgi6Gq2F7NqSr04eORyQcbC.jpg","credit_id":"6423b25ac04429026b118073","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984295,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alec Parent","original_name":"Alec Parent","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423b272aaec7100931cf250","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984295,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alec Parent","original_name":"Alec Parent","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423b915aaec7100931cf522","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28091575","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5a71nXcxyr86HzDqsQnGf09sl8C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1917}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2550,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vv3IFbyYA8JcSwgdVMHszqKRvSm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1700},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eLplJPTnS5SoTdavniKTwSIVRz3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dustin Nickerson | Runs in the Family (Full Comedy Special) #newcomedy #standupcomedy","key":"0Dybn3Atj9k","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-03-29T00:00:10.000Z","id":"6423b2f7a3e4ba00f2328d1f"}]}}}
