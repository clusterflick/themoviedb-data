Anton Krastev, a DOP and his wife Diana are separated by the Iron curtain - she fled with their son Antoan to Western Berlin while he stayed in Bulgaria. She believes that Antoan can only be cured in Germany. But Anton can't live without his job. He works with the best film director who is a high ranking Communist. The State Security Services are keeping a zealous eye on Anton. His phone calls are being taped, his letters are being read. His close relations to the power people of the day make him even more suspicious. The State Security Services put an end to Anton's relation with his wife. Thorn apart, Anton and Diana go through love, alienation and hate. There comes a time though when the powerful friends of Anton lose their power and he loses everything that he's ever loved - his work, his wife and son. Thirty years later Anton shoots the story of his own life. But those who now direct the movie are the very same people who once persecuted him.","popularity":0.3129,"poster_path":"/zXWmG4A7fjXRKlU0p5RQbDCdd2V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voice Over","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Barnev","original_name":"Ivan Barnev","popularity":0.103,"profile_path":"/6eVZuGv7FplYlZXhWRX0ZaKFWwi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anton Krastev","credit_id":"66b3e8dbfa53395dc36a3684","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kasiel Noah Asher","original_name":"Kasiel Noah Asher","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/298Jqh1BJUkMfF6BZBCj3hMgBaC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Diana Krasteva","credit_id":"66b3e97920854ad9c77b96ea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1255959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koyna Ruseva","original_name":"Koyna Ruseva","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/qo7i7C2s5hgCRWbIaBuHFHbCDb2.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Carlo's Wife","credit_id":"67d9aff35ac5af5d2baebad9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1255960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tzvetana Maneva","original_name":"Tzvetana Maneva","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/6GLR7Ju0y0xLYLTBGBZd2fSvkVa.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Diana's Mother","credit_id":"67d9b01275362d856d17d9a0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Mavrodiev","original_name":"Stefan Mavrodiev","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":"/jxvvnh8mPEYQZVeVjp5ZaU1ybZ7.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Anton's Father","credit_id":"67d9b0265ac5af5d2baebb03","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentin Ganev","original_name":"Valentin Ganev","popularity":0.1728,"profile_path":"/9mS8rtog7pDBEgM9zk1Lc5cID3G.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Carlo","credit_id":"67d9b03d41d983133217dd5a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1508647,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Svetoslav Ovcharov","original_name":"Svetoslav Ovtcharov","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/1SO4KrppIOEdXlpU7bhRnUk600D.jpg","credit_id":"64249a7c960cde0103a352a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1508647,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Svetoslav Ovcharov","original_name":"Svetoslav Ovtcharov","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/1SO4KrppIOEdXlpU7bhRnUk600D.jpg","credit_id":"66b3e99bf7a06306d86f727d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hristo Totev","original_name":"Hristo Totev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b3ea65b304f5785ce185a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575824,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rali Ralchev","original_name":"Rali Raltschev","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b3eb2f914705e7906f77f9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1997472,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bozhidar Petkov","original_name":"Божидар Петков","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b3eb4bf4b7362d34622889","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1616204","wikidata_id":"Q12280274","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zXWmG4A7fjXRKlU0p5RQbDCdd2V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":275694,"name":"bg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
