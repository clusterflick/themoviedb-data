The geographer is gone, but his thoughts remains. Its political and cultural ideals inspire the debate on Brazilian society and the construction of a new world. His statement is a true testimony, a lesson that the world can be better. Based on geography, Milton Santos performs a reading of the contemporary world that reveals the different faces of the phenomenon of globalization. It is in the evidence of contradictions and paradoxes that constitute everyday life that Milton Santos sees the possibilities of building another reality. He innovates when, instead of standing against globalization, proposes and points out ways for another globalization.","popularity":0.6267,"poster_path":"/2CWy44sQHPUJn2huwKnQdg9gENx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Milton Santos, Pensador do Brasil","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milton Santos","original_name":"Milton Santos","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"642594a3c044290236ca3d6e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1138622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvio Tendler","original_name":"Silvio Tendler","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":"/wDhgT6rFtzmzLvmFHqFjPeY9iZd.jpg","credit_id":"642594e8a3e4ba0095f1c7d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2CWy44sQHPUJn2huwKnQdg9gENx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":192940,"name":"geography"},{"id":214608,"name":"geopolitics"},{"id":217051,"name":"afro brazilian"},{"id":222930,"name":"latin american history"},{"id":233421,"name":"brazilian politics"},{"id":253224,"name":"brazilian history"},{"id":256404,"name":"latin americans"},{"id":256736,"name":"latin america"},{"id":264118,"name":"brazil"},{"id":279389,"name":"brazilian cinema"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"},{"id":286670,"name":"latinx"},{"id":308686,"name":"latin"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"FILME | Milton Santos, pensador do Brasil, 2001","key":"XUodFeve88g","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-09-10T18:09:21.000Z","id":"642595c98de0ae00f4beb183"}]}}}
