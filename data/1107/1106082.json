Sifr, which could be a love story. Sifr, which is a queer story. A lot of it is memory. Two young girls, away from home, in red-bricked walls, in long corridors of an all-girls college. Navigating self-hood, sexuality, desire, and spatiality through companionship and common ground. Sifr, which can also mean silence, absence, or negative space. Infinity. Infinite possibilities, blank slate. Sifr, which divides the narrative, time and again, to capture ruptures within interpersonal relationships, and how the self experiences urban loneliness,heartbreak, intimacy, and ultimately, self-awareness.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dDCrd3QNHoUuPXdadCSQjIkRWRc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"sifr","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mekhala Singhal","original_name":"Mekhala Singhal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mekhala","credit_id":"6423aa3f37b3a9011364a9be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekssha Kashyap","original_name":"Ekssha Kashyap","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ekssha","credit_id":"6423aa55a3e4ba0077918cef","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984232,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Khushi","original_name":"Khushi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423aa088de0ae00b6526d70","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"JK","original_name":"JK","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423a959a3e4ba00f23288d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984227,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aanand Sagare","original_name":"Aanand Sagare","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423a9a5960cde009a9582ee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984229,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adrija Ghosh","original_name":"Adrija Ghosh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423a9beaaec7100f2b310e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"JK","original_name":"JK","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423a98ba3e4ba00f23288f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984234,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Soyam Dean","original_name":"Soyam Dean","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423aa146905fb012607ab12","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dDCrd3QNHoUuPXdadCSQjIkRWRc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
