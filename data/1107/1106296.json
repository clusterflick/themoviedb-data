How can the substance of motion be visualized? What degree of abstraction allows a communication with the viewer?  Therefore movements of famous Olympians were digitalized into 3D through motion tracking and rotoscoping of original footage of Olympic competitions. Camera motions and playback speed of the footage were borrowed and the movements of the athletes were recreated frame by frame.  The specific character of each sport is reflected in the visual language and the illustration of its motions.","popularity":0.7099,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citius, Altius, Fortius","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3985116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Deimann","original_name":"Felix Deimann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64247aed8de0ae00978b48c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3985116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Deimann","original_name":"Felix Deimann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64247bc86905fb00bd08e74d","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3034808,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kreng","original_name":"Kreng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64247bd36905fb00e0548468","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3985116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Deimann","original_name":"Felix Deimann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64247be0960cde012633102b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":2070,"name":"olympic games"},{"id":10159,"name":"computer animation"},{"id":281135,"name":"olympic sport"},{"id":297442,"name":"animation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Desert Dust Cinema","release_date":"2014-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Citius, Altius, Fortius","key":"100576137","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2014-07-12T10:12:46.000Z","id":"64247c728de0ae00978b4941"}]}}}
