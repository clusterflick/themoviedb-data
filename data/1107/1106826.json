Political motivations aside, the film shows Bangkok as a capital on the cusp of modernity that still preserves its traditional values, and there are scenes that evokes nostalgia such as the ballroom dancing at Lumpini Park Auditorium, Chalermthai Theatre on Ratchadamneon Avenue, Dusit Zoo, Don Mueng Airport, the studio at Thailand’s first TV channel, night scenes of downtown Bangkok, and many more.","popularity":0.1215,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":191546,"logo_path":null,"name":"U.S. Information Service","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bangkok, Our Capital","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2903,"name":"propaganda"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"th","note":"","release_date":"1957-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
