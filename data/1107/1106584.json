Home to America’s most notorious sheriff, Joe Arpaio. Serving time in Maricopa County is brutal. Inmates do their time outside in military surplus tents, 365 days a year. And the sheriff’s taken away all privileges: no television, no coffee, no cigarettes...He’s even put women on a chain gang to teach them discipline and deter crime.
