Tyrannized by their powerful neighbors, they talk about their lawsuits and sing about their two-century struggle, filmed in the village, during a procession to San Pedro and an expedition to the court where a delegation will file a complaint.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Of the Tree, the River and the People's Cry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrice Chagnard","original_name":"Patrice Chagnard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6426894a8de0ae01134ecb66","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrice Chagnard","original_name":"Patrice Chagnard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642689348de0ae01134ecb51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3571196","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
