The AIDS epidemic hit San Francisco the hardest and created a wave of fear and uncertainty that left many victims feeling hopeless and alone. Brinker, a woman whose deep compassion became a source of strength for others struggling to cope with the times, began cooking meals in her kitchen to deliver to her neighbors who were too ill to take care of themselves. Her goal was to not only provide meals but to also revitalize the city's sense of community and spend time with HIV/AIDS patients to end the isolation they experienced.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/whIJpTF5ILgm2ePooJA5zimmpJ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105592,"logo_path":"/yur3TTcyJi6Eko9XhKaMfoirN7j.png","name":"Burn A Light Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ruth Brinker Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3987144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Brinker","original_name":"Ruth Brinker","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"642659d6960cde0103a3fa3a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3987145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandy Kovtun","original_name":"Sandy Kovtun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ruth Brinker","credit_id":"642659f26905fb0103228453","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3987148,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Victoria Beits","original_name":"Victoria Beits","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64265b057f6c8d00d50433fa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Apo W.
