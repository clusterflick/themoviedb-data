But the epic film he planned and largely shot would never be completed. In 2012, film historian Ian Christie visited the hacienda where Eisenstein spent much of his time in Mexico, to ask what really went on there, and discover what’s happened since. This essay film, made in partnership with Japanese filmmaker Chiemi Shimada, looks beyond the apparent failure, to ask what contemporary audiences – and Eisenstein himself – could still learn from Que Viva Mexico!","popularity":0.0653,"poster_path":"/6egwRyUIP6rs1rm5PnlG39uEd7r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Trip to Tetlapayac","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2416353,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiemi Shimada","original_name":"Chiemi Shimada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642491f4d132d60111be2398","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Christie","original_name":"Ian Christie","popularity":0.1153,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6424920ad132d6009322939f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6egwRyUIP6rs1rm5PnlG39uEd7r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
