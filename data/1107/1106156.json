Today, neither \"Buraku\" nor \"Burakumin\" exist anymore in terms of laws and social systems. However, many Japanese people still have a deep-rooted sense of discrimination towards people who descend from those families. Why does something that should not exist continue to exist? How did this discrimination begin in the first place? This film takes a variety of approaches to unravel the history of accumulated discrimination and its intricately intertwined context, from its origins and evolution, vividly depicting the structure of discrimination that often remains hidden from the public eye.","popularity":0.1527,"poster_path":"/lnKTjmKSCwmbRRJlAt2RdJzjaLE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":205,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Watashi no hanashi buraku no hanashi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186890,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yûsaku Mitsuwaka","original_name":"Yûsaku Mitsuwaka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64240828a3e4ba00f232b56e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1651920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arata Oshima","original_name":"Arata Oshima","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642408448de0ae00f4bdf555","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20563462","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lnKTjmKSCwmbRRJlAt2RdJzjaLE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":297101,"name":"caste discrimination"},{"id":315271,"name":"buraku"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
