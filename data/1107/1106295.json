To do this, I unspooled the whole roll in order to have a rectangular working base, onto which I applied Super 8 emulsion from another film, in a crosswise fashion, going from strip to strip diagonally and horizontally. The visual effect is totally abstract and resembles a mosaic, with its many little triangular forms.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/381fShEzyuzITegQLvkv1NOtM8H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MOSAÏC","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1692660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cécile Fontaine","original_name":"Cécile Fontaine","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/9P70SF2jALMTfsuWR3wi5uytWpI.jpg","credit_id":"642478f06905fb0077efe01c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/381fShEzyuzITegQLvkv1NOtM8H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
