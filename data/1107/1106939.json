He ran away with an ancient book of his teacher.  Dewa Tuak did not pass down all his knowledge, because Penging committed many crimes.  Dewa Tuak then sends another student, Anggini (Devi Ivonne) to retrieve the book, while Penging has appointed himself as regent of Lumajang.  When they met, Anggini even asked to be his wife.  Because the request was rejected, Anggini was detained and will be hanged.  So Dewa Tuak then asked Wiro Sableng (Tonny Hidayat) for help.  On the way, he met Mahesa Kelud (Johan Saimima) who also had a grudge against Penging, because Penging had stolen both of his weapons.  The two of them, with the help of Dewa Tuak, were finally able to finish off Penging.  Anggini then arranged an arranged marriage with Mahesa Kelud.","popularity":0.0894,"poster_path":"/gqbqDtzhxm3XIwBBscjR5oFbdRr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79888,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Cancer Mas Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1988-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sting of a Poisonous Warrior","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","title":"Wiro Sableng 7: The Sting of a Poisonous Warrior","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tonny Hidayat","original_name":"Tonny Hidayat","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Wiro Sableng","credit_id":"6426491e01b1ca0113caf4e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1689526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devi Ivonne","original_name":"Devi Ivonne","popularity":0.1847,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Anggini","credit_id":"642649418de0ae00f4bf04c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Santoso","original_name":"Robert Santoso","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Penging","credit_id":"6426495bc0442901e8165c62","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1202405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piet Pagau","original_name":"Piet Pagau","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/sc28qcTi4fQ0D04Ic5DKrY3bQDj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dewa Tuak","credit_id":"642649659cc67b0093a48661","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1688384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Saimima","original_name":"Johan Saimima","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mahesa Kelud","credit_id":"642649786905fb009ad7b0e1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":568594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanaka","original_name":"Tanaka","popularity":0.1563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"66104d969d592c01471ec123","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Syamsuri Kaempuan","original_name":"Syamsuri Kaempuan","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"66104dab2476f2017e7b3b8a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamal Jentak","original_name":"Jamal Jentak","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"66104db69d592c017a1ec4db","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1692386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Gesha","original_name":"Bobby Gesha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"66104dc76c8492017d0b76b0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1489310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruslan Basrie","original_name":"Ruslan Basrie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"66104dfba76ac50186bae467","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Netta Sri Suprapti","original_name":"Netta Sri Suprapti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"66104e24dd47e10162b72aab","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1643307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zaitun Sulaiman","original_name":"Zaitun Sulaiman","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"66104e35dd47e10162b72aaf","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2035517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yongky","original_name":"Yongky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"66104e4befe37c016cc11542","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tisna S.
