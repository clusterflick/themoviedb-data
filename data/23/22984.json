It captures their zany craziness and outrageous antics from the initial formation of the group in 1964 to 1978. It notably features the band's last performance with long-term drummer Keith Moon, filmed at Shepperton Studios in May 1978, three months before his death.","popularity":1.5676,"poster_path":"/30KLQduKvVzuYbqHMrWBcDHKs7O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14313,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Who
