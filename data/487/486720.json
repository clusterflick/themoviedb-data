What is special: Their service area is the border system, an anti-imperialist protective wall according to their superiors, death strips and prison bars for a population incapacitated in naked reality. Now, seventeen years later, there is a reunion with the comrades and the old post.  This feature film, which was the first in reunified Germany to deal with the inner workings of the GDR border troops, tells of life on the fence, the associated contradictions and some hot phases in the Cold War.","popularity":0.2872,"poster_path":"/vcWHehWK7Ov3JaDR326wN2BS6Dq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary about five young men who are being trained as border guards in the former GDR.","title":"Grenze","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Grenze - Lebensabschnitt Todesstreifen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2129145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dirk Bojanowski","original_name":"Dirk Bojanowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b9e78b90e0a26756301edc8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2129146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Longin","original_name":"René Longin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b9e78c00e0a26756501fbff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2129147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siegfried Mücke","original_name":"Siegfried Mücke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b9e78c7925141260001cbdc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":164954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Nathan","original_name":"David Nathan","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/kyyRs1ARDz9YMfzCMvA8QggjdCu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5b9e78d00e0a26755f01e74e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2129148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Rataj","original_name":"Thomas Rataj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b9e78d9925141260601ba6b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1277144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolai Tegeler","original_name":"Nicolai Tegeler","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/zBrMWTuz5d1mO11GreuHLheXGnC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5b9e78e1c3a3684406020146","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2129149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Wolf","original_name":"Thomas Wolf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b9e79140e0a26755f01e7c3","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326788,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Holger Jancke","original_name":"Holger Jancke","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9e789a92514125e901b6bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326788,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Holger Jancke","original_name":"Holger Jancke","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9e78a4c3a368440e01e66a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0432407","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1181,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vcWHehWK7Ov3JaDR326wN2BS6Dq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":827}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":292,"name":"berlin wall"},{"id":13065,"name":"soldier"},{"id":156026,"name":"east germany"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
