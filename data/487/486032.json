These men and women, that back then were children, found a legendary Jewish-German character named Fredy Hirsch, who changed their lives forever. The work describes the terrible living conditions in Terezin Ghetto and; on the other hand, the approach to culture and art behind the walls of the concentration camp. Up to this moment, everything develops as a known story, but by the end of 1943 there is an unexpected turn when these children are deported together with their families to the extermination camp in Auschwitz-Birkenau. And there, in the middle of hell, they lived in.","popularity":0.6159,"poster_path":"/qQLLIUZCc2fLQ4rW2ueFtDcsmO1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1269,"logo_path":null,"name":"Momentum Films","origin_country":""},{"id":97111,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cohen y Cohen Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heaven in Auschwitz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dinah Gottliebova","original_name":"Dinah Gottliebova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a03f07c9251412e1a008e71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Gross","original_name":"Eva Gross","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a03f098c3a3680fc100898f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dita Krause","original_name":"Dita Krause","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a03f0a69251412e0d0092f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1920235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zuzana Růžičková","original_name":"Zuzana Růžičková","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a03f0b49251412e230092af","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bedrich Steiner","original_name":"Bedrich Steiner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a03f0c39251412dc5009607","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1920237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fredy Hirsch","original_name":"Fredy Hirsch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"archive","credit_id":"5a03f114c3a3680fe7008d7f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920239,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Esther Cohen","original_name":"Esther Cohen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a03f1629251412dc5009731","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920240,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stephanie Kurian Fastlicht","original_name":"Stephanie Kurian Fastlicht","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a03f17f9251412e28009162","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920241,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fernando Alanis","original_name":"Fernando Alanis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a03f191c3a3680f7d00a0d6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1050096,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sabina Berman","original_name":"Sabina Berman","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a03f1429251412df8009192","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2659336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Cohen","original_name":"Aaron Cohen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed16c21528b2e00206a00b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5676108","wikidata_id":"Q24708068","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"doc_auschwitz"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/clhY7nUsUd1XW08B6UYI99LXQBw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qQLLIUZCc2fLQ4rW2ueFtDcsmO1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10939,"name":"holocaust (shoah) survivor"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
