Like many others  who oppose the pipeline’s construction, Gray wishes to defend the water source for his community & the integrity of this sacred site.  But Gray’s involvement in the fight is driven by more subtle motivations: after losing a son to suicide as a consequence of bullying, Gray has resolved to fight all forms of bullying & oppression.
