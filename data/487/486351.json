She invented the multiplane camera and created the first feature length animation. Lotte that Silhouette Girl is an homage to her, told in Lotte’s style, with stop motion shadow animation and through a lens of folktale storytelling. For many unjust reasons, Lotte is just a footnote in the history of film, but she revolutionized animation and made it what it is today. In this short film, Lotte’s puppets have come back to life to set the story straight.","popularity":0.0822,"poster_path":"/6HTt9Uh6E519ktCW1S9ZOmPcW6a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Once a small girl, from Berlin, hailed from the shadows a light from within.","title":"Lotte That Silhouette Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":549834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lotte Reiniger","original_name":"Lotte Reiniger","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/tHompQjOe14o9WvImnIw4qGSAMj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self- Narrator","credit_id":"6404eda8383df200835b83a2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2597613,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carla Patullo","original_name":"Carla Patullo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404ee6e383df200835b83e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228825,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jennifer Maisel","original_name":"Jennifer Maisel","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404ee4f136545009e7be4a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2597613,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carla Patullo","original_name":"Carla Patullo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404ed5b13654500846bfde7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3950298,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elizabeth Beacherl","original_name":"Elizabeth Beacherl","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404ee2567dcc90085f67e90","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3950294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Beecherl","original_name":"Elizabeth Beecherl","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404ed4a13654500ba4eb955","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7289540","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6HTt9Uh6E519ktCW1S9ZOmPcW6a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Red Rock Film Festival","release_date":"2018-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lotte That Silhouette Girl (2018) - Official Trailer | A new Lotte Reiniger documentary","key":"AXLwrpI-5DQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-03-28T23:09:37.000Z","id":"6404ed2139271200a9f3c394"}]}}}
