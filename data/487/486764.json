Along with Elena, a photographer for a magazine, we end up in La Fortuna, where Elena takes Ana after helping her when she feels unwell after a marathon. There, in the bar, we’ll get to know Ana’s world, her father, a likable sponger, and her long-suffering mother, and we’ll accompany her on her road to independence.","popularity":0.0879,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tenderness and the Third Person","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Llorca","original_name":"Pablo Llorca","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a089e94c3a368672a002be6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7548984","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
