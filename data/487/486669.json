Tregenza remains a master cinematographer throughout, and the various ellipses between sequences are often as provocative as the sequences themselves” (Jonathan Rosenbaum).","popularity":0.3634,"poster_path":"/8jhFX1rTdAbi5kkYxUNhnZlQtQy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Arc","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ash Adams","original_name":"Ash Adams","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"John Butz","credit_id":"5a0823cdc3a36833ac014ce4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Fennell","original_name":"Gregory Fennell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a0823ebc3a36833ac014d0b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1252516,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Catherine Fogarty","original_name":"Catherine Fogarty","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a0823fac3a368341c01404e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1155981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Hemmingsen","original_name":"Brian Hemmingsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a082405c3a3683344015aef","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Holden","original_name":"Larry Holden","popularity":0.1803,"profile_path":"/1ZYJUFYu97gM0MaCX5EI6oJZu89.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a0824229251414bc2014330","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Lodge","original_name":"Mary Lodge","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a08242c9251414c2d013cb1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Mendenhall","original_name":"Jennifer Mendenhall","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a082436c3a368341c014097","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Nees","original_name":"Hugh Nees","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5a082441c3a36833ac014d74","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1080885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Tregenza","original_name":"Rob Tregenza","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":"/u8I28bxOm30ik4RFqBKQzeX5UF4.jpg","credit_id":"5a082458c3a368341c0140ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1080885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Tregenza","original_name":"Rob Tregenza","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":"/u8I28bxOm30ik4RFqBKQzeX5UF4.jpg","credit_id":"5a082463c3a36833ee0130d4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922394,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"J.K.
