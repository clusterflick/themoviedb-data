Featuring sprightly music by folk singer Pete Seeger and narration by theatre actress Frances Hyland, the film is shot through the seasons on a large Canadian cattle ranch near Kamloops, British Columbia. With hundreds of cows and calves on the ranch, there’s no shortage of work to be done: soil cultivation and crop maintenance are taken care of by seasonal ranch hands while the resident cowboys—“anxious guardians”—brand and breed their bovine charges.","popularity":0.3743,"poster_path":"/zHUVIIRPQCfmlcGMBMS2YO4X10O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1961-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cattle Ranch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1923063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thérèse Arbic","original_name":"Thérèse Arbic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator (French Version)","credit_id":"5a099c23925141781101a52e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89094,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frances Hyland","original_name":"Frances Hyland","popularity":0.1152,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (English Version)","credit_id":"5a099c3c92514177f6019c33","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1594953,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy L.
