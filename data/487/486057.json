In the jungle of western Nepal lives Fofo, who is married off at the age of 10 to a man of 20. When Thuli becomes a widow after 10 childbirths she is mocked at by both neighbours and relatives. Savitri did not even know the name of the groom she was marrying and she was not even allowed to see him during the wedding ceremony. Nepalese law does not allow child marriage but the law does not reach girls who have never been to school and are living in areas with no roads. This film shows some of the reasons behind the 40 % guerrilla women in the Nepalese Maoist army.","popularity":0.4086,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97113,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmcentrum","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"}],"release_date":"2007-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daughters' Destiny","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Khadka Karki","original_name":"Anita Khadka Karki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a041c7ac3a3680fe700c995","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thuli Maya","original_name":"Thuli Maya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a041c8cc3a3680f6c00dfcb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Savitri","original_name":"Savitri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a041cbbc3a3680fc100c620","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"May Gauffin","original_name":"May Gauffin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a041cd99251412dc500d85a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920352,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Gauffin","original_name":"Christian Gauffin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a041cf0c3a3680fd400c1da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"May Gauffin","original_name":"May Gauffin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a041cfe9251412dc500d896","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1969973","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2692,"name":"arranged marriage"},{"id":212915,"name":"women's rights"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
