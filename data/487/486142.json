Mouris says, “I shot another 100 foot roll on classmate Jerry Strawbridge’s home animation stand, and edited that into the best sequences from QUICK DREAM. The whole film was a tongue-in-cheek series of odd couples/couplings, which the title suggested. The FRANK FILM photo collage animation evolved here.” - Yale","popularity":0.3566,"poster_path":"/zkOtKfQFNLymIW1NkiYlFkpekzQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You're Not Real Pretty but You're Mine...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Mouris","original_name":"Frank Mouris","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/mA9fL4PcVuNe9jjzwMxGApu4gwS.jpg","credit_id":"5a0485d49251414a69000093","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8946514","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6faCSDckg1FxIUSPWCmVrkeI6mj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1057,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zkOtKfQFNLymIW1NkiYlFkpekzQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":213891,"name":"abstract"},{"id":214793,"name":"cutout animation"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"You're Not Real Pretty But You're Mine...
