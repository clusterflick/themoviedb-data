The museum caretaker observes the work of art being brought to the lounge where it will be exhibited to the public. The wet box drips on the paint, the paint softens and releases the conjoined painters who walk around the museum intervening on the works of art in a Cubist and Surrealist manner. The caretaker \"chases\" our painters in a classic cartoon chasing, using the Renaissance mechanisms to restore the order.","popularity":0.3553,"poster_path":"/8MiHRDOwO8Ep4sphNtIoG5eTHz6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weba!!!","origin_country":""},{"id":97237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animacting","origin_country":""},{"id":97238,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animatório","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2013-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A short animation film about two genius painters wreaking havoc in a museum","title":"Dalivincasso","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922228,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Demian Rios","original_name":"Demian Rios","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a07cb939251414bce00c277","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcelo Castro","original_name":"Marcelo Castro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a07cb54c3a36833bf00dc4f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marlon Tenório","original_name":"Marlon Tenório","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a07cbecc3a368337f00be76","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marlon Tenório","original_name":"Marlon Tenório","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a07cb67c3a368334400da38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcelo Castro","original_name":"Marcelo Castro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a07cbff9251414bfa00c586","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcelo Castro","original_name":"Marcelo Castro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a07cbc5c3a368341c00ca4a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcelo Castro","original_name":"Marcelo Castro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a07cba2c3a368341c00ca1c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marlon Tenório","original_name":"Marlon Tenório","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a07cbadc3a368341c00ca26","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":847,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/8MiHRDOwO8Ep4sphNtIoG5eTHz6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":603}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2598,"name":"museum"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":236810,"name":"paintings"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
