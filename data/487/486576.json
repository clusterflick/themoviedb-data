The boudoir inside an industrial plant brings an aggressive aesthetics to the teachings and orgies. The takes are developed in different ways. The franzy of orgies has a fast editing, whilst philosophical moments are long sequence shots. By bringing to the contemporary world a 200-year-old romance, we intend to trigger questions about the real moral changes in Western society. It is also interesting to highlight Sade's feminism. His female heroes are independent women, masters of their own sexual drive. At last, due to the solid theatrical background of the artists, the film was inevitably contaminated by unusual procedures, contributing to new possibilities of exchange between arts.","popularity":0.1322,"poster_path":"/oVivo3wQlp7Qulac5qz7OCm4eUy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51859,"logo_path":null,"name":"Satyros Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Philosophy in the Boudoir","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Philosophy in the Alcove","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1357370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phedra D.Cordoba","original_name":"Phedra D.Córdoba","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/stRNlvG6HffT4B1R0D9tFL3XcAm.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Augustin","credit_id":"67f583f08cfccf7bafd99874","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephane Sousa","original_name":"Stephane Sousa","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Juliette","credit_id":"5a078eab9251414bfa0068f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1922056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Godinho","original_name":"Hugo Godinho","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/qNePlG2AXMHfePKz9dJPWXevTwH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Escravo","credit_id":"5a078eb9c3a368341c006d55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2881913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bel Friósi","original_name":"Bel Friósi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Eugenie","credit_id":"5fcae01b3f8ede003d612e40","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2881914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzana Muniz","original_name":"Suzana Muniz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mistival","credit_id":"5fcae04966a7c3003e48b9e0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3096405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrique Mello","original_name":"Henrique Mello","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/6sf9LCZWJ6V32mupG5ycg1FMH1M.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dolmance","credit_id":"60a58759543398003eb17caf","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1458238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodolfo García Vázquez","original_name":"Rodolfo García Vázquez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bbva4rEgSsyXwxMuKMAWpMLxu0G.jpg","credit_id":"5a078ef6c3a36833bf0077d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivam Cabral","original_name":"Ivam Cabral","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/Aw5OHoaaV7PY6Utql7xjihPfw17.jpg","credit_id":"5a078ed79251414bc2006deb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7894158","wikidata_id":"Q116298787","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/olXh2sb1R74uSx8bmnV80RwBN9d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oVivo3wQlp7Qulac5qz7OCm4eUy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Filosofia na Alcova • Trailer • Estreia 23/NOV","key":"jjQRyLDFXT0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-11-24T01:55:13.000Z","id":"61fb0a51b6abc40044523349"}]}}}
