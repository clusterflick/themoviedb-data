Each year, the Arnold Strongman Classic crowns the winner in the purest test of strength on the planet. This year’s Arnolds are unique with each of these four weighing more than 400 pounds. Lithuanian Zydrunas Savickas, 40, is the acknowledged Strongest Man Ever, who may have passed his prime. American Brian Shaw is the defending champion, a 6’8’, 425-pound giant who seems poised to take the crown. England’s Eddie Hall is “the hungry wolf, ” knocking on the door. “I’ll do anything, ” he says. “I’ll die, if I have to. ” Finally, there’s Icelander Hafthor Bjornsson, who plays the Mountain on Game of Thrones. He’s the youngest of the group, but with perhaps the greatest potential. “It’s great to see these Monsters, ” says Arnold Schwarzenegger, the host of the competition and a former bodybuilding champion. Born Strong revels in the drama when these remarkable giants clash.","popularity":2.549,"poster_path":"/fot5hiDybdAk5z6YeMzPw1kXSjI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104284,"logo_path":null,"name":"Triple Threat Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Born Strong","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":28,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Рожденный сильным","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","original_name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","popularity":3.445,"profile_path":"/2marNcjIfCUE5Z2HyrcEiJHPbsA.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a54f9fd0e0a2607e4012f89","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1369307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson","original_name":"Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson","popularity":0.5854,"profile_path":"/wDyF1bkjZb2c4zw7hi27LZh2H6a.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a54fa0ec3a3685ecd012a74","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Henry","original_name":"Mark Henry","popularity":0.9931,"profile_path":"/cvE0cob8gdCgm9V2ecvPwtEXvuT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a54fa4c0e0a2607d4012736","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Shaw","original_name":"Brian Shaw","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/m6ObzUvnnOCjckPZd99W74HmBbl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61e70d652d93750041aa4b6b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2369623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Hall","original_name":"Eddie Hall","popularity":0.617,"profile_path":"/7rF3bFpbAIOTMoq3gzR4I27yK7w.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61e70ddb41a5610019742051","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3388229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zydrunas Savickas","original_name":"Zydrunas Savickas","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":"/zAskIoQabwEOBAPsaDfTgDwjzuR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61e70df790ea4b009cae935d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":772146,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gary Cohen","original_name":"Gary Cohen","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a54fa780e0a2607d7012ae5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross Hockrow","original_name":"Ross Hockrow","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a54fa880e0a2607e0012783","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross Hockrow","original_name":"Ross Hockrow","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a54fb109251417aaf01171a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7582508","wikidata_id":"Q47461742","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9jQCFmeXFCjdvEkIEn4Ynl12udn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fot5hiDybdAk5z6YeMzPw1kXSjI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/unuGr2Kawzhxvo91JLISZwXE2cA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Born Strong\" Trailer - Strongman documentary on Netflix","key":"u7-qeEr7kSE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-01-12T14:25:13.000Z","id":"65e6bfa809dda4017cbe1aa4"}]}}}
