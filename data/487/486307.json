They have known each other for 30 years. Elfriede Jelinek is the better known of the two, the great author with her analytical mind and her social commitment against the whole \"politician's docks.\" The now deceased lyricist Elfriede Gerstl remains rather tender with her poetry, although her poems do not miss a certain amount of sharpness, albeit ironically packed. When the two Elfrieden sit in their Viennese coffee house and drink the little brown, they usually talk about clothes, they talk about the fashion that Elfriede Gerstl has just collected again.","popularity":0.3098,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Klarfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elfriede & Elfriede","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1074827,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elfriede Jelinek","original_name":"Elfriede Jelinek","popularity":0.0754,"profile_path":"/GB1KJDPzA5QLAjJfrjxgdIArRx.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a059978c3a3686a8c018168","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elfriede Gerstl","original_name":"Elfriede Gerstl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a05998b9251417de60168d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberley Gebhardt-Reschke","original_name":"Kimberley Gebhardt-Reschke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a0599b2c3a3686a38015a77","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921079,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Peter Göltenboth","original_name":"Peter Göltenboth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a059a109251417e1c017542","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921076,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Karin Eckert","original_name":"Karin Eckert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0599fe9251417e1c01750d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hanna Laura Klar","original_name":"Hanna Laura Klar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0599eb9251417de60169b3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":72275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva C.
