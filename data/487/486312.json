The film highlights the significance of this act and its background.  Beate Klarsfeld, born in Berlin in 1939 as Beate Künzel, is primarily known to people as \"the woman with the slap\" and as the Nazi hunter. In 1960 she went to Paris and met her future husband Serge Klarsfeld, whose father was deported to Auschwitz and murdered there. She was confronted with the darkest part of German history, about which she had learned nothing at school. Serge gave her books to read and made her actively deal with them. Since then, she has not let go of dealing with the crimes of the Nazi era. For them, it was always about \"responsibility, not guilt\".","popularity":0.3363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Klarfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin - Paris: Die Geschichte der Beate Klarsfeld","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1906926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beate Klarsfeld","original_name":"Beate Klarsfeld","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":"/gGDSRHrd7n8KprakCbiQp22FOkk.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a059fa49251417de60173f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1906927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Klarsfeld","original_name":"Serge Klarsfeld","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/lJlZ8uwxWVRCk8KzXuhulYvYQGP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a059fb79251417dfd017194","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1921097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arno Klarsfeld","original_name":"Arno Klarsfeld","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":"/555fxqTyxNT9Z088SE9zUxoqWiE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a059fc3c3a3686ac7017fc0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1369289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günter Wallraff","original_name":"Günter Wallraff","popularity":0.2466,"profile_path":"/dCPafcANfHEK2KZa1yugb9rfobh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a059fe69251417e1c018049","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921100,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aliosha Biz","original_name":"Aliosha Biz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a05a067c3a3686adc016763","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921098,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Maurice Eberl-Rothe","original_name":"Maurice Eberl-Rothe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a05a0229251417dc901841e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599349,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Judith Futár-Klahn","original_name":"Judith Futár-Klahn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a05a082c3a3686af101816a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921099,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Irmis Leidenschaft","original_name":"Irmis Leidenschaft","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a05a0559251417de601758c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Giefer","original_name":"Thomas Giefer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a05a033c3a3686a68017c6f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hanna Laura Klar","original_name":"Hanna Laura Klar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a05a000c3a3686a8c018f0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hanna Laura Klar","original_name":"Hanna Laura Klar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a05a00f9251417e1c0180b2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2051827","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":191726,"name":"nazism"},{"id":239538,"name":"nsdap"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
