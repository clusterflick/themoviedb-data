Those who have to work themselves to death until dawn to complete one more designated driving call also need warm encouragement. They met sisters who did the same job when they joined the 'Kabugi Mutual Aid Association', a mutual aid organization for designated drivers. Until then, they were lonely individuals who worked separately. They shared their joys and sorrows, created an app to find a late-night restroom, and also grew a community that helped designated drivers who were having a harder time than them. The reality is not easy, but the weed-like vitality of these female designated drivers who encourage each other and live faithfully every day is tenacious.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2024-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Ghosts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5341855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Chang-woo","original_name":"Lee Chang-woo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ebc40bd76c159a15fb0fec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2NqTL9oC3fgeuR13M7pNqaDT4N8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Independent Film Festival Busan","release_date":"2024-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Busanjin, Busan","release_date":"2024-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
