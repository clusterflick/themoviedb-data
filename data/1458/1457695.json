With nothing but a beat-up bicycle, a cassette Walkman, and a heart full of questions, Jamie traverses quiet highways and forgotten towns, collecting stories from strangers and uncovering a family secret long buried. As the miles stretch on, so does Jamie’s understanding of love, grief, and the threads that connect us all.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/uOveK0CjQJ6MbbBTn5NdIzrkBk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":12,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Run to Deetle Baby","title":"Running To Deetle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uOveK0CjQJ6MbbBTn5NdIzrkBk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
