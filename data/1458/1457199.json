Not only a profession, but above all a discovery of the world through films, yesterday as today.","popularity":0.0759,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":188501,"logo_path":null,"name":"Doruntina Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like Life - Private Stories of Italian Film Critics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2866442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianni Canova","original_name":"Gianni Canova","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/4IdTJfttlOCr7Xh765uII5HWcmR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67ead69b9de606b446b6f23f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Goffredo Fofi","original_name":"Goffredo Fofi","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":"/6VG5KwjbqUP5buDRp7MLnZoCwcf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67ead6a40e2ac292dc244b7f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriano Aprà","original_name":"Adriano Aprà","popularity":0.2561,"profile_path":"/pQHVez81yQSeZaHGSfvufjyI3kk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67ead6b79de606b446b6f253","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Silvestri","original_name":"Roberto Silvestri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67ead6d3dd55f16c015499b3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2372195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Mereghetti","original_name":"Paolo Mereghetti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/jA1VJhoTkIZSq4wvGrOOeMltUNH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67ead6ecd0847d03bf549497","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Menarini","original_name":"Roy Menarini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67ead7070e2ac292dc244be0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniele Vicari","original_name":"Daniele Vicari","popularity":0.1482,"profile_path":"/ujmpIe6CyclCJ6uvzKhJw3hAIqy.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67ead7264958d1f68124496d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1640342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Giusti","original_name":"Marco Giusti","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/wRdMSH0WkzRpnz3YKHgxHFkbwCi.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67ead7b1d52ea23087b6f3ce","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irene Gallina","original_name":"Irene Gallina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ead57bb82f7f7dd3244a52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340311,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stefano Cattini","original_name":"Stefano Cattini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ead5b00cec672270b6f420","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3012357,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michele Guerra","original_name":"Michele Guerra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ead768dd55f16c01549a12","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5340309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irene Gallina","original_name":"Irene Gallina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ead790d52ea23087b6f3c9","department":"Crew","job":"Mix Technician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
