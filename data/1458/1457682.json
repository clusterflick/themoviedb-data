For a long time he tried to a frazzle out his father's hunting gun for that purpose. Eventually he gets the gun. Already in the forest Haik understands it's not a pheasant hunt season; besides he doesn't know how to use the gun. As it gets darker, the colorful autumn wood turns into a cold and a frightening place, that the desperate boy strives to escape... Finally he manages to get a pair of superb pheasants. And perhaps something else, that is much more important.","popularity":0.0717,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pheasant Hunter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5342597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samvel VARDANYAN","original_name":"Samvel VARDANYAN","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67ec15a39cbdf6a94af63823","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashot Adamyan","original_name":"Ashot Adamyan","popularity":0.1218,"profile_path":"/xzmXMoBeOwf2WXOfJOkmdUzLrLx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67ec15b0db09e9bd84df90bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5342598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie GALSTYAN","original_name":"Annie GALSTYAN","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67ec15cddb09e9bd84df90cc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Narine Grigoryan","original_name":"Narine Grigoryan","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":"/vOsN0bCQJ7PqAvKXmcjCtNSO45b.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67ec15daa5aa153610df9370","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1644263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sos Janibekyan","original_name":"Sos Janibekyan","popularity":0.2142,"profile_path":"/nnbVkJCrFAN9bSP7YTHwO0fwIeR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67ec15eca5aa153610df9378","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3685907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Janibekyan","original_name":"Karen Janibekyan","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":"/rYeR1leUgb3xkZLMOBU9YhIFLAp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67ec15f89cbdf6a94af6383f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364253,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marine Zakaryan","original_name":"Marine Zakaryan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ec16159cbdf6a94af6385a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":522463,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Saroyan","original_name":"William Saroyan","popularity":0.2062,"profile_path":"/dcDbFEQv8vypyEUot7XGRCXD6qO.jpg","credit_id":"67ec162ea5aa153610df93a7","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hy","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
