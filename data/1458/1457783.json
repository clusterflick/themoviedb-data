Inspired by the drama of Fântâna Albă on April 1, 1941, the film reconstructs the fate of a Romanian community in Bessarabia, massacred in a desperate attempt to find refuge from the Soviet occupation. The testimony of a survivor of this genocide becomes the backdrop against which archival images and his wife's memories of Siberia are superimposed, in a dizzying game of mirrors that questions the notion of historical truth and reveals forgotten traumas with potentially devastating consequences in the present.","popularity":0.0948,"poster_path":"/ySv3YNWkvIBzOjskNVce6Tf8yWX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Spruce forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":438968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mircea Andreescu","original_name":"Mircea Andreescu","popularity":0.1579,"profile_path":"/4r4x9TpKQExMwU5EUOvZwGod1tC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67ec5158c544233d8f2fd07b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":62510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coca Bloos","original_name":"Coca Bloos","popularity":0.1552,"profile_path":"/mUWogAKk9yoGHUi5L8xvsNHJhjR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67ec5161674aa4c86efa0d5e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ionuţ Caras","original_name":"Ionuţ Caras","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/d0E9e2AHIjyd5Ur3Ke4wWmrIvhb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67ec516ac544233d8f2fd087","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tudor Giurgiu","original_name":"Tudor Giurgiu","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ec51ffc544233d8f2fd0d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tudor Giurgiu","original_name":"Tudor Giurgiu","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ec52096b570401632fc4e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tudor Giurgiu","original_name":"Tudor Giurgiu","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ec522019f1b1cb4efa101d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34766491","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"ro","file_path":"/ySv3YNWkvIBzOjskNVce6Tf8yWX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":282633,"name":"history"},{"id":336573,"name":"romanian history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ro","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pădurea de molizi | Teaser","key":"azCK5vcpUVs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2024-12-04T09:31:06.000Z","id":"67ec52fe6b9788d3f7c74f36"}]}}}
