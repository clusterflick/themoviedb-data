In the 1960s TV changed the way tornado safety and preparedness information was disseminated and this film is likely a product of that development. This film opens with vignettes of people in a small town somewhere in Americaâ€™s suburban midwest. It then goes on to display the moments before and after the onset of a tornado and informs the audience of appropriate safety response measures.","popularity":0.1434,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":224509,"logo_path":null,"name":"Defense Civil Preparedness Agency","origin_country":""},{"id":258161,"logo_path":null,"name":"Screenscope Inc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Countdown to Survival: Tornado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2213,"name":"tornado"},{"id":2221,"name":"meteorology"},{"id":3694,"name":"weather"},{"id":322237,"name":"severe weather"},{"id":346504,"name":"preparedness"},{"id":349518,"name":"tornadoes"},{"id":349519,"name":"weather prepardeness"},{"id":349520,"name":"weather warning"},{"id":349521,"name":"tornado spotting"},{"id":349522,"name":"safety preparedness"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"COUNTDOWN TO SURVIVAL\"  1976 TORNADO WARNING SYSTEM & SAFETY PREPAREDNESS FILM  XD47954","key":"xeoUYzAaGNM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-01-26T17:29:53.000Z","id":"67ec1890c544233d8f2fbc62"}]}}}
