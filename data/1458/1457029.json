Every night he sees a hidden object picture of people, rooms and corridors. Each surveillance image provides insights into other people's lives. The interpretation is up to him: is what is happening a problem for security in the building? Somehow he had imagined things differently. Should it go on like this?

When something unusual flickers on the monitor, he makes a decision - hoping to take the right path this time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/u8gKuH4OkflCuESA6pREEibLmbl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Night after night alone in this room...","title":"Naim's Donkey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5339357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Vodovozov","original_name":"Ron Vodovozov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ea727b4f741c75bbc6cc91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u8gKuH4OkflCuESA6pREEibLmbl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
