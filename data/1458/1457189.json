In a place where the Romani people speak the Gurbet language, a white woman named Suzana embraced the customs and culture of the Romani community and learned their language. During that time, mixed marriages within the Romani community were considered taboo. However, there was a myth about a white woman and a Romani man. Bozidar and Suzana were the first to turn that myth into reality, challenging tradition and fighting for their love. Following this precedent, marriages between Romani and non-Romani individuals became more common and accepted.","popularity":0.0638,"poster_path":"/9ZImaAnzlhL3bEaH3ENZj8P5xhR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Daughter in Law","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4527848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bojan Dakić","original_name":"Bojan Dakić","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ead0e80cec672270b6f26f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2103290,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Goran Velemir","original_name":"Goran Velemir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ead0fee6a8555884549402","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2350752,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pavle Nikić","original_name":"Pavle Nikić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ead1159de606b446b6f0ae","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36387060","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9ZImaAnzlhL3bEaH3ENZj8P5xhR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: EnergaCAMERIMAGE Film Festival edition","release_date":"2022-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Festival of Ethnological Film","release_date":"2022-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Ukrainian Online Edition","release_date":"2022-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
