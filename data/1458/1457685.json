The scene was first recorded off a screen using a digital camera.  2. This footage was then manually combined and rendered into a new composition.  3. A custom-built application was developed to randomly fragment and rearrange sections of each frame.  4. Finally, the resulting image was manually refined and retouched.  This is the first entry in a new series, closely related to the Interludes series and conceptually linked to the previous shorts Trazos and Silence, where cinema is reinterpreted through various processes of deconstruction and reassembly.","popularity":0.1813,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2025-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film Study 01","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Piccoli","original_name":"Michel Piccoli","popularity":0.7552,"profile_path":"/4OgjMYKH3qi67HOeEvYoIeENMDW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Footage from La Belle Noiseuse","credit_id":"67ec18a06b9788d3f7c73ff8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuelle Béart","original_name":"Emmanuelle Béart","popularity":1.4414,"profile_path":"/yPEWzvYnPsOy2BSDgMrhrQsIh0N.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Footage from La Belle Noiseuse","credit_id":"67ec18bd19f1b1cb4efa00b8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Rivette","original_name":"Jacques Rivette","popularity":0.4753,"profile_path":"/rJVyIQcU8CcCkWOuThhY1g5SrSh.jpg","credit_id":"67ec18d16b9788d3f7c74002","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4631662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eloy Gurucharri","original_name":"Eloy Gurucharri","popularity":0.1285,"profile_path":"/9nHytUNJP5Jy9EtYYE5wsunTp2M.jpg","credit_id":"67ec18db6b570401632fbc83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4631662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eloy Gurucharri","original_name":"Eloy Gurucharri","popularity":0.1285,"profile_path":"/9nHytUNJP5Jy9EtYYE5wsunTp2M.jpg","credit_id":"67ec18e30bd6634b852fbd9a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4631662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eloy Gurucharri","original_name":"Eloy Gurucharri","popularity":0.1285,"profile_path":"/9nHytUNJP5Jy9EtYYE5wsunTp2M.jpg","credit_id":"67ec18ec19f1b1cb4efa00d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uXnEPy5MgLRwRcMJ3BAliGwidxs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Estudio Filmico 01","key":"ShMJdubV9K8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-01T18:00:06.000Z","id":"67ec362df0f4a7bec1fa0070"}]}}}
