It is a safe haven for ill babies unable to get treatment elsewhere. In 2014, this ward was established via the charitable work of ASSAMEH Birth & Beyond. Sadly, on the 4th August 2020 the hospital was badly damaged in the Beirut port explosion forcing it to shut down and relocate to a temporary location.  This short film takes us into the hospital a couple of months before the explosion to meet the staff and volunteers who work tirelessly to help sick and vulnerable children. Through their struggle and dedication, we see the fragility of the Lebanese healthcare system in relation to its weak economy and precarious work force as well as the altruism of the Lebanese people, offering glimmers of life to ill, sometimes neglected and hopeless, babies.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/7aNtnmDY6iccO3BwKu8VmbNbnD0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A short documentary on the Karantina hospital in Beirut.","title":"Beating Hearts","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1984071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cyril Aris","original_name":"Cyril Aris","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/2sPlzqChdaoBZiN1W03lfzLTedd.jpg","credit_id":"5f7b7122021cee0038342b49","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1984073,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joe Saade","original_name":"Joe Saade","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7b7144d5ffcb0036a6f089","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1984071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cyril Aris","original_name":"Cyril Aris","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/2sPlzqChdaoBZiN1W03lfzLTedd.jpg","credit_id":"5f7b71333e2ec80035cf8f4f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1984071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cyril Aris","original_name":"Cyril Aris","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/2sPlzqChdaoBZiN1W03lfzLTedd.jpg","credit_id":"5f7b7110d5ffcb0036a6ef6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2804564,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anthony Sahyoun","original_name":"Anthony Sahyoun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7b7167e039f10037f35009","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369387,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rawad Hobeika","original_name":"Rawad Hobeika","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7b7183944a570035d85b88","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7aNtnmDY6iccO3BwKu8VmbNbnD0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"english_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ar\", \"native_name\"=>\"Arabic\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Beating Hearts: Beirut’s haven for sick babies","key":"xJ-jv9bcay8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-29T16:00:09.000Z","id":"5f7b70aafdfc9f0038afddc1"}]}}}
