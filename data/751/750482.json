Achieving excellence in the competitive culinary world is a task that requires hard work, which is no problem for him, because that example has always been present in his mother, Carme Ruscalleda. For several years, Raül was immersed in the world of drug addiction, which meant he was unable to be a rational person who liked to enjoy life. It also prevented him from growing more professionally. Nevertheless, he finally succeeded in standing up and being the person that he is today, the real Raül. His family is a fundamental pillar and now he sets himself increasingly higher challenges in which he combines his passion for cooking with the extravagant daily activities he publishes on Instagram. This documentary shows part of his journey since the closure of Sant Pau, his mother's 3-star restaurant.","popularity":0.1197,"poster_path":"/uUF0BPbGCKwLLbgtuiezAzUb5Jh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Way","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2805926,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Toni Balam","original_name":"Toni Balam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7cb9ea3429ff0038ba1444","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1851553,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Àngel Parra","original_name":"Àngel Parra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7cb9bdd5ffcb003504e370","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2805925,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carmen de Couto","original_name":"Carmen de Couto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7cb9df8741c400377ba1df","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1851555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Peira","original_name":"Pedro Peira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7cb9ca0e597b0036b2e2fa","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1851556,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergio de Uña","original_name":"Sergio de Uña","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7cb9d5944a570035dddf1b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13986070","wikidata_id":"Q111329403","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uUF0BPbGCKwLLbgtuiezAzUb5Jh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
