(It was also adapted in the 1972 British anthology movie Tales from the Crypt). Kirk Douglas stars as a blood-and-thunder World War I general who discovers his son is a coward in the grim \"Yellow,\" the most dramatically acute of the trio. Digital magic morphs Humphrey Bogart into \"You, Murderer,\" a high-concept, rather gimmicky tale of murder, double crosses, and poetic justice as seen through a dead man's eyes. Isabella Rossellini (daughter of Bogie's Casablanca costar Ingrid Bergman) and John Lithgow costar as plotting lovers.","popularity":2.202,"poster_path":"/zzeBLqqJc8D8WZZ9o5XRFu64VV6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From Forrest Gump's 1994 Academy Award Winning Director","title":"Tales from the Crypt: The Robert Zemeckis Collection","video":true,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Kassir","original_name":"John Kassir","popularity":0.4453,"profile_path":"/byj6Px0tLcqRFWIJYUxstg25Qd2.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Crypt Keeper (voice)","credit_id":"5f7e2ac50499f2003863b900","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Ellen Trainor","original_name":"Mary Ellen Trainor","popularity":0.4173,"profile_path":"/Y926jxSOXikBiqQIptho1VzU9o.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Wife","credit_id":"5f7e2ad4d8e15a0039db2973","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Drake","original_name":"Larry Drake","popularity":0.4951,"profile_path":"/vPI6gPoWskUMWla92MOiSD1OuBt.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Santa","credit_id":"5f7e2afa2667780039aef677","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Bell","original_name":"Marshall Bell","popularity":0.7846,"profile_path":"/3AdZRUFlmV9KvArzqSVEVZVl0Sa.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Joseph","credit_id":"5f7e2b14fdfc9f0038ba7e9a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lindsey Whitney Barry","original_name":"Lindsey Whitney Barry","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Carrie Ann","credit_id":"5f7e2b272667780039aef722","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirk Douglas","original_name":"Kirk Douglas","popularity":1.7362,"profile_path":"/yvunzQgnILw6uNBFMyld5nhkBCX.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"General Kalthrob","credit_id":"5f7e2b44c8113d0038a844dd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Douglas","original_name":"Eric Douglas","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":"/1WaALQcPHl39xANREHURLIj1gGv.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Lt.
