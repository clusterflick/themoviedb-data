Through the logic of montage, Picture Start delves into the splice, that very intersection of frames combining one scene and another and the process of holding them together. By focusing on and enlarging this moment, the material base of the image appears in its luminous translucency as abstract composition.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yQIBAYL5ag0CKmcOVj3ghHvw3v9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PICTURE START","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2807261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virginia Hilyard","original_name":"Virginia Hilyard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7e2d170e597b0037b93954","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yQIBAYL5ag0CKmcOVj3ghHvw3v9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
