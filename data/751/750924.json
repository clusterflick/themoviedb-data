At the moment of truth, your hands won't be at low-ready, your attacker won't be a piece of paper stapled to a framework seven yards away, and he won't wait there patiently while you carefully aim and squeeze off a few rounds.  In this original video production, best-selling author and world-renowned combat shooting instructor Gabriel Suarez teaches you the combat-proven skills you need to win an actual gunfight against a committed assailant. Suarez focuses on such critical topics as the importance of shooting on the move, how to perform a malfunction clearance in the thick of combat, proper use of cover, and why proficiency in one-handed shooting skills is vital.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/31G57KkWt3XrOMWUnJcLOZ4zte0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":206,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SI: Close Range Gunfighting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/31G57KkWt3XrOMWUnJcLOZ4zte0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
