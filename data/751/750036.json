We follow their naive non-sequiturs, surreal sequiturs, memories and dreams. We dance back and forth through the whimsy of their minds and quirks of their lives which prove to be off-beat, as we are whisked through images of a zoo fresh out of pandas, a head gift-wrapped in a map of Wisconsin, a ziplock bag containing sadness, revengeful hamsters and a robot father playing football with his robot son. Eventually their thoughts become intertwined, and they realize they are not alone, giving them the courage to finally turn to each other and say hello.","popularity":0.639,"poster_path":"/pvH6wSkmEQFI6IOSy2srxYLaxCC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Me, You, a Bag & Bamboo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirby Heyborne","original_name":"Kirby Heyborne","popularity":0.215,"profile_path":"/wXVH8j1bwrnGP4W8OLEgu1iQTRO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Clifford","credit_id":"5f7ae420e039f10038e9e405","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ceciley Jenkins","original_name":"Ceciley Jenkins","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":"/x1Gx3r7gM784TNjafXk8dYF2buT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Chun Li","credit_id":"5f7ae434fdfc9f0036ac51bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alanna Bernhoft","original_name":"Alanna Bernhoft","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Narrator","credit_id":"5f7ae445fdfc9f0036ac525a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Havey","original_name":"Allan Havey","popularity":0.3079,"profile_path":"/sSacPgmV3r5n3cWTMyVvW9pNkBS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Chun Li's Father","credit_id":"5f7ae459c8113d00369fd951","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1178376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Merson","original_name":"Susan Merson","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":"/7SwfUhYxg32hPndbu2NSnLMaqaS.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Chun Li's Mother","credit_id":"5f7ae46a223e200038c11dd6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1212108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Easley","original_name":"Margaret Easley","popularity":0.3829,"profile_path":"/mR65jOp6IEXtAXrhNRLsDpXDvaO.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Clifford's Mother","credit_id":"5f7ae47c9a64350036a7b7cf","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":203264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara Everly","original_name":"Lara Everly","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7ae37afdfc9f0036ac4944","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":203264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara Everly","original_name":"Lara Everly","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7ae3829a64350036a7b785","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1099170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annika Marks","original_name":"Annika Marks","popularity":0.3973,"profile_path":"/pn0sTENODGNYHuTbjT6EiBIAboA.jpg","credit_id":"5f7ae3e68741c400396fbfba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803987,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Padraic Duffy","original_name":"Padraic Duffy","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7ae4088741c400387b3733","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1337662","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pvH6wSkmEQFI6IOSy2srxYLaxCC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":712}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
