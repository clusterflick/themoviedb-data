The son he left behind, entrusted to watch over his ill-gotten riches. A bearded vagrant with a pistol and a decades-old bullet scar in his stomach. An alcohol soaked deputy with half an ear on one side. And a burned out street hustler with a sick mother and a festering vendetta. They trail Henry to a dilapidated hotel where he plans to reunite with his son and the secret bag of gold he left behind.","popularity":1.0869,"poster_path":"/ujFuLWo8iEsV5XVsjblhry97WH4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6679,"logo_path":"/r3r7qbHKgo8N0yr7r1TjLmzLXfQ.png","name":"MarVista
