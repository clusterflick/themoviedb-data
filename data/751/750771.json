Mood Hall — the enigmatic game played amongst the survivors in the post-apocalyptic world. Mysterious middle-aged and older gentlemen and beautiful women. Little People. Giants. Deserts. The bottom of the pool. A high-density labyrinthine world consisting of experimental, artistic, adventurous, half sci-fi and half mystery sketches. A masterpiece of cinema that eschews words and invites you into a world of seeing and hearing only!  “Mood Hall” was first presented in 2016 as an installation work in Kawai+Okamura’s retrospective exhibition. “Mood Hall” was made into a movie with music by Marihiko Hara in 2019. In 2022, the music of “Mood Hall” was completely recomposed by Kazumichi Komatsu. Reconstructed by Komatsu’s bold analysis, “Mood Hall” was renamed “Mood Hall side B.”","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/nrz1EwjFiytunw23gRVX4Huvxpq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mood Hall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Mood Hall [side B]","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Mood Hall side B","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroki Okamura","original_name":"Hiroki Okamura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651885c507216600e2d5c299","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takumi Kawai","original_name":"Takumi Kawai","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651885f2a199a600ab1932b4","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroki Okamura","original_name":"Hiroki Okamura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651885e393bd6900e12dcf9c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroki Okamura","original_name":"Hiroki Okamura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651885b5ea84c700aee9acaf","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Character Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takumi Kawai","original_name":"Takumi Kawai","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651885fc967cc73426091b8c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Character Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takumi Kawai","original_name":"Takumi Kawai","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6518860993bd6900acc6e92a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2737240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marihiko Hara","original_name":"Marihiko Hara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651884d1967cc73426091b4d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroki Okamura","original_name":"Hiroki Okamura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6518858793bd6900e12dcf8e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takumi Kawai","original_name":"Takumi Kawai","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65188594967cc73427f0bb71","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takumi Kawai","original_name":"Takumi Kawai","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7dc98d0e597b0036b609e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroki Okamura","original_name":"Hiroki Okamura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7dc99b01e4d10038f5ea15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16162374","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mHJ8kVhzjMXg1VvOpluZ3eP9nF9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nrz1EwjFiytunw23gRVX4Huvxpq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zUy2yzr1jk7VU2d3mN8kVYyc5IJ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mood Hall [side B] (2022) A Short Film by Kawai+Okamura","key":"dPnaC5HCHkI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-15T09:00:09.000Z","id":"67ae5c5b3e4967e13e36f2e7"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mood Hall | Full Movie | Directed by KAWAI+OKAMURA","key":"tvXzKyd75io","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-08-07T15:00:14.000Z","id":"64dcc490001bbd041af3ce27"}]}}}
