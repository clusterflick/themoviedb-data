Originally a front-wheel drive model, the introduction of the fire-breathing V8 brought a rear-wheel drive option into the fabulous range already available.  This is the story of the concept, design, development and production of these historic cars and told exclusively by the men who were there at the time including presentation by former Rover dealer Mike Humble. It is one of the most comprehensive classic car documentaries ever made and packed with interviews and archive films and images.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/iAGCBsHk8JYhuYe9PEcE5HRvs08.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Story of the Rover 75 & MG ZT","title":"Code Name R40","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2807077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Clancy","original_name":"John Clancy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7e0de8f90b190037c9a461","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"BulletDVD","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1027,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iAGCBsHk8JYhuYe9PEcE5HRvs08.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":686}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rover 75 MG ZT documentary preview - Code Name: R40","key":"aa8SdZfJ_0c","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-27T12:13:26.000Z","id":"5f7e0e750e597b0035b4730b"}]}}}
