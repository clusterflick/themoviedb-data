Two soldiers from the 2-14 were killed and eighteen wounded in what many have described as the most ferocious urban combat since the Battle for Huế during the Tet Offensive in 1968.","popularity":0.2501,"poster_path":"/n4eZzmc4ZwvjcSlSSei6CXXZGM7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"...of the 2-14 Infantry Battalion from the 10th Mountain Division during the battle of Mogadishu in October, 1993","title":"Black Hawk Down: The Untold Story","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2807356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Randall Larsen","original_name":"Randall Larsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7e41380499f20037630b5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2807357,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew King","original_name":"Andrew King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7e41d0b7abb5003668ea97","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2807358,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Greene","original_name":"Jason Greene","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7e41fc944a570037d98fa8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2807359,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michelle Greene","original_name":"Michelle Greene","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7e42140e597b0037b97b48","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2807360,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Stone","original_name":"Adam Stone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7e42433429ff0036cd10fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2807356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Randall Larsen","original_name":"Randall Larsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d99d42bb433951a7367378","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14115592","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"BHDUntold","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n4eZzmc4ZwvjcSlSSei6CXXZGM7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Black Hawk Down - The Untold Story - Trailer","key":"6KTM2-VtOg0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2019-03-27T16:49:56.000Z","id":"67d99d185f58e32f7e08a918"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"2-27-19 1400 Trailer","key":"320340633","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-02-27T20:27:29.000Z","id":"5f7e4081b7abb500386a41cc"}]}}}
