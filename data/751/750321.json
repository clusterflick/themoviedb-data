His wife helps him in the kitchen and yearns to return to Rejkyavik. In the café, Krilli’s brother Alli sits with the old fishermen, the last boxer in Iceland and the translator of Don Quixote into Icelandic. Every day they find a new answer to the world’s problems. Once a month the neighbours meet at the Bryggjan café to remember those who died in Grindavik and pronounce their names. Four crazy musicians play jazz. A few lost tourists turn up at the fishing harbour and are captivated by the atmosphere in the café. Real people, they think. A real place. On the other side of the mountain is the Blue Lagoon, the island’s great attraction. People from all over the world come in fascination to see the volcanoes, the ice and the genesis of the Earth.","popularity":0.1277,"poster_path":"/xXMYKXwr5203nixs0ofRbiowsfh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Nominum","origin_country":"LT"},{"id":141386,"logo_path":null,"name":"AXFILMS","origin_country":""},{"id":141387,"logo_path":null,"name":"REC GRABAKETA ESTUDIOA SL","origin_country":""},{"id":141388,"logo_path":null,"name":"SUICAFILMS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2020-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lobster Soup","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Moles","original_name":"Rafael Moles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7c2fcb3e2ec80037d9eecf","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ólafur Rögnvaldsson","original_name":"Ólafur Rögnvaldsson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7c2fd6944a575d2ec7a5c5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2203959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pepe Andreu","original_name":"Pepe Andreu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7c2fc0c8113d0038a30514","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2203962,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"José Luis González Iglesias","original_name":"José Luis González Iglesias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7c2ff1c8113d0035a0accc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Moles","original_name":"Rafael Moles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7c2fb609191b00378e164e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2203959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pepe Andreu","original_name":"Pepe Andreu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7c2fac9a64350037ae36cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2203963,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alberto Lucendo","original_name":"Alberto Lucendo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7c30123e2ec80037d9efb4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2805129,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sara Marco","original_name":"Sara Marco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7c30058741c400387fdadc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":550068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arūnas Matelis","original_name":"Arūnas Matelis","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/oIZZkntuWV2YhAWOW1XAUFUxEfF.jpg","credit_id":"5f7c2fe0d861af00367afab2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13626436","wikidata_id":"Q108294392","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xXMYKXwr5203nixs0ofRbiowsfh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":840}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
