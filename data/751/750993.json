The parallels between these two tragedies are heartbreaking, far too similar and significantly different in how public leaders are responding. This film examines both tragedies, where the hatred for the LGBT community comes from, what can are doing as individuals and communities, to remedy the hate and violence.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/A3MtE4XHnyugUXBD5pNaKmjiDqQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tracking Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2807472,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sheri Wright","original_name":"Sheri Wright","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7e7bbd35c30a0034741a22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5813930","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A3MtE4XHnyugUXBD5pNaKmjiDqQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
