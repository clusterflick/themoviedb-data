As legions of tireless workers toiled for six years to realize the vision of shady entrepreneurs and imaginative engineers, the remarkable railway dream slowly became a reality. But not everyone was so pleased with the remarkable achievement. Despite the devastating effect that the tremendous transportation breakthrough would have on the Native American population, the lasting impact of the Transcontinental Railroad on the politics and culture of a rapidly expanding country would forever mark it as an invaluable component of the American success story.","popularity":0.5673,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Transcontinental Railroad","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"American Experience: The Transcontinental Railroad","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Transcontinental Railroad: American Experience","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Transcontinental Railroad (American Experience)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Murphy","original_name":"Michael Murphy","popularity":0.444,"profile_path":"/3quWjoqh8vKoSXE9Ll3AC7pgsRh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64a9aeced1a893011c3261aa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209957,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Chin","original_name":"Michael Chin","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625392179d6e334abde113c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Zwonitzer","original_name":"Mark Zwonitzer","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625392294df291009db4bf30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209957,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Chin","original_name":"Michael Chin","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9aedad1a893011c3261b4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Zwonitzer","original_name":"Mark Zwonitzer","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9aee56a344800c9fa9579","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Zwonitzer","original_name":"Mark Zwonitzer","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9aeecd1a89300ff80820f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1096257,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bruce Shaw","original_name":"Bruce Shaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9aef766a0d30100d8cae1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1814308,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yuka Nishino","original_name":"Yuka Nishino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9af1cd1a89300e2f8b2b4","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72184,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Keane","original_name":"Brian Keane","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/7uzwWfjwy31GydOoeqBgJefRfzq.jpg","credit_id":"64a9af2566a0d30100d8caf7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":774666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Londoner","original_name":"Marco Londoner","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9af3c9c97bd00e24c0780","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0406281","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18044,"name":"railroad"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
