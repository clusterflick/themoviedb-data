Photographed on Super 8mm and using hand-processed film techniques to create an unworldly zone between sleep and wakefulness, it looks at three characters and the film’s material that connects them.  It is a film that invites the viewer to sleep with the film’s protagonists, to drift across into the dream world of the film’s material and lose touch with their current surroundings.","popularity":0.1807,"poster_path":"/doihoVkLM6QSFuoCThvNgU445L5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fivesixteen Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2012-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Must Watch, While Some Sleep","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conor Higgins","original_name":"Conor Higgins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a231b8092514103390bbfed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keeley Milne","original_name":"Keeley Milne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a231b880e0a264cc10ba6fb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janine Williams","original_name":"Janine Williams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a231b900e0a264cc10ba703","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Higgins","original_name":"Michael Higgins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a231b46c3a3680b8d0bc558","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Higgins","original_name":"Michael Higgins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a231b64c3a3680b880bf45c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conor Higgins","original_name":"Conor Higgins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a231bc9c3a3680b8d0bc5c6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Higgins","original_name":"Michael Higgins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a231bbc0e0a264ccd0bf710","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933758,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Keith Adcock","original_name":"Keith Adcock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a231bd80e0a264cca0baf3a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Higgins","original_name":"Michael Higgins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a231ba70e0a264cca0baf1c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Higgins","original_name":"Michael Higgins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a231baf0e0a264cc10ba717","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2568100","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/we5oaJknusJfekVnyrKAgUTVpmJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.727,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/doihoVkLM6QSFuoCThvNgU445L5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1163}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1566,"name":"dreams"},{"id":10937,"name":"memory"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cork Film Centre Gallery","release_date":"2012-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Associacao Castelo F'If Open Studio Residency","release_date":"2012-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
