Productions this romantic comedy set in Los Angeles. The film, shot in collaboration with members of his extensive family—brothers Antonio (assistant director) and Eduardo Samaniego (art director), sister Carmen Samaniego (actress), and uncle Ramón Guerrero (actor)—centers on the romance of the rich Rosalía (Luana Alcañiz) and the poor Alberto, a swimmer played by real life Argentinian swimmer José A. Caraballo, who, like the character in the film, had competed in the 1932 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games.","popularity":0.1252,"poster_path":"/9irn77v3vlRbMPSZo60sTXXDb3F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105953,"logo_path":null,"name":"R.N.S.
