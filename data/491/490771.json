Opposing himself to the current nature films that tend to highly compress time in order to end up with a concentrated sequence of action-elements Kristersson leaves rhythm and tempo almost completely up to the magpies themselves. With great integrity he filmed the daily, social and emotional life of a species of birds that has many points of contact with human life. Thus, the movie offers us the oppurtunity to view our own everyday existence through other eyes, from a world right above our heads, but yet so far away.","popularity":0.2455,"poster_path":"/acwkY9FMGWPSwSziiuY36ryEPY2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98114,"logo_path":null,"name":"picafilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1987-03-14","revenue":13487,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pica Pica","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikael Kristersson","original_name":"Mikael Kristersson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/wcdBULwM14f2aA9bBKhGQmMzOtB.jpg","credit_id":"5a254c06c3a3680b9a0e4bc2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikael Kristersson","original_name":"Mikael Kristersson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/wcdBULwM14f2aA9bBKhGQmMzOtB.jpg","credit_id":"5a254bb80e0a264cd00d9c82","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikael Kristersson","original_name":"Mikael Kristersson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/wcdBULwM14f2aA9bBKhGQmMzOtB.jpg","credit_id":"5a254bf00e0a264cc10d72f8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikael Kristersson","original_name":"Mikael Kristersson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/wcdBULwM14f2aA9bBKhGQmMzOtB.jpg","credit_id":"5a254bc592514103290dd799","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikael Kristersson","original_name":"Mikael Kristersson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/wcdBULwM14f2aA9bBKhGQmMzOtB.jpg","credit_id":"5a254ba492514103260dfaab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0093736","wikidata_id":"Q10631435","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/acwkY9FMGWPSwSziiuY36ryEPY2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":553}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4474,"name":"ornithology"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":240241,"name":"magpies"},{"id":240242,"name":"birds"},{"id":240243,"name":"birb"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"1987-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
