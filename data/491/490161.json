As part of the filmmaking process, he's been given a camera to document his world. The footage he gets is urgent, because there's a war against squeegee kids. This documentary is from the point of view of the kids themselves, in order to provide alternative voices. Roach's camera is positioned behind \"enemy\" lines: living in derelict buildings, squeegeeing for money, being hunted by police.","popularity":0.1538,"poster_path":"/tCzYtVY1ASgKVOst9pJl54BmaG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"S.P.I.T.: Squeegee Punks In Traffic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1932734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Denis","original_name":"Eric Denis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a20dca1c3a3680b9309dcc5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90716,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Cross","original_name":"Daniel Cross","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/fTn02qt67eL0bI9dVfdvgntLWwa.jpg","credit_id":"5a20dcb1925141032409b78a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0307398","wikidata_id":"Q7387262","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":1004,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tCzYtVY1ASgKVOst9pJl54BmaG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":726}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2913,"name":"diary"},{"id":6719,"name":"montreal, canada"},{"id":177927,"name":"homeless"},{"id":240166,"name":"squeegee"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
