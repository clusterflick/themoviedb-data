Utilizing impressive large-scale real-life stunts, CGI and strong character stories, the show makes the staggering scale of the inner workings of the body tangible. We will show you how far our blood travels in just one day - an astounding 19, 000 km - from Quebec City to Buenos Aires and back. You will see all the cranial fluid you produce in your lifetime laid out in front of you - all 26,280 pint glasses worth. And in just one day you will take 23,000 breaths - enough air to fill 7,714 helium balloons. You will see all this and much more.","popularity":0.3292,"poster_path":"/hCseMTvfglxGuJNKdnp6pjRxcuT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98083,"logo_path":null,"name":"MB Media Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Body Machine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Arenshtam","original_name":"Gabriel Arenshtam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jake (in the future)","credit_id":"5a243afb92514103290ce4d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Aubin","original_name":"Jane Aubin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a243b020e0a264ccd0cd718","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Chasin","original_name":"Marshall Chasin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a243b16c3a3680b960ca553","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Connor","original_name":"Michael Connor","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a243b37c3a3680b930cb971","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Campbell","original_name":"Douglas Campbell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5a243b4492514103300c56ad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813903,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Corbett","original_name":"Patrick Corbett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a243b6692514103240c8e96","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ella Grant","original_name":"Ella Grant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"5a243c1992514103360cc22d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Duffy","original_name":"Evan Duffy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Scott (Age 14)","credit_id":"5a243c2fc3a3680b8f0ca20b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1934241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaiman Teevins","original_name":"Kaiman Teevins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Scott (Age 8)","credit_id":"5a243c58c3a3680b880cd59f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Joseph Salerno","original_name":"Mario Joseph Salerno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Scott (age 2)","credit_id":"5a243c6dc3a3680b880cd5c1","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934232,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laine Drewery","original_name":"Laine Drewery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a243adb0e0a264cc40c5788","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Bicknell","original_name":"Robin Bicknell","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a243abe0e0a264ccd0cd6ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Bicknell","original_name":"Robin Bicknell","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a243ac60e0a264cc40c575d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1422204","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2248,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hCseMTvfglxGuJNKdnp6pjRxcuT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1497}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6016,"name":"biology"},{"id":211558,"name":"body"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
