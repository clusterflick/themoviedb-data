In 2004, she re-works this haunted video, playing it in real-time but letting bleed in a host of present day interviewees who also reflect upon AIDS, death, activism, and video. What remains is this woman's contemplative, loving memorial to one gay man lost to AIDS that also marks what changes and lasts after death, across time, and because of videotape.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video Remains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Lamb","original_name":"James Lamb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a23900c92514103260c6fcf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1727035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Juhasz","original_name":"Alexandra Juhasz","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/prNwDrKHLGhO2mk0apV78MbAtvR.jpg","credit_id":"5a23634792514103240be189","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1536513","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
