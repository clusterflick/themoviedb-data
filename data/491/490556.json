When the doctor tells her it’s a good sign because it means her condition is improving, she panics: the idea of gaining back the kilos she lost scares her to death.

escape everything which is considered socially acceptable.","popularity":0.1642,"poster_path":"/urJV7eT302FHl0s89Ga2oiy4M5v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75068,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yif'at
