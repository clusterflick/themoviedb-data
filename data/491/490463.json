After England clearly dominated the first two days of the 2nd 3 mobile Ashes Test at the Adelaide Oval, a draw appeared to be the most likely result. Ricky Ponting's Australian side had other ideas.  On the final day, with masterful bowling and courageous batting, Australia achieved the unthinkable, winning the Test by six wickets with 3.1 overs to spare. In one of the greatest comebacks in history, the Australian Cricket team not only crushed England's hopes in the Second Test, butquite possibly buried their dream of retaining the Ashes.  Hosted by Richie Benaud and Michael Slater, this exclusive DVD brings you the incredible moments of that historic Test, including the euphoric post match celebrations.","popularity":0.2657,"poster_path":"/aR09ZP7gS6WGF3eaiS68Pgz4Mlf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17767,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roadshow Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2006-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The 2nd 2006-07 Mobile Ashes Test","title":"Amazing Adelaide","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richie Benaud","original_name":"Richie Benaud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"5a23f53dc3a3680b960c63b6","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1596,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5qfUlFE83gtGwB9Jb4mvKSPND6o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2838},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j7KXumpDHfBKigK1RUcWKRexdwB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1556,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aR09ZP7gS6WGF3eaiS68Pgz4Mlf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1038}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5657,"name":"australia"},{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":5719,"name":"cricket"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Amazing Adelaide","key":"2xPx8Mq65Rg","published_at":"2013-12-12T03:19:13.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"5a23f7a092514103360c8047"}]}}}
