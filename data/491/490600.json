Two tramps see the amount of money he has and plan to steal it. In the town he befriends a Mexican girl by stopping her uncle from beating her for having broken a water jar. Retiring to his room, he is awakened by the two tramps breaking into his room. He steals out and gets lodging at a nearby house, which happens to be the home of the Mexican girl and her uncle. The tramps follow him and try again. The girl, however, saves him from harm, and it looks as if Dick had found a real heroine for a real romance.","popularity":0.5247,"poster_path":"/7KfNjkXLpHjlSwUceCmyhg5eTfY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Lodging for the Night","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles West","original_name":"Charles West","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/b83aIQMnrWmXxnYm5vbPI1izN7u.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Dick Logan","credit_id":"5a2435d892514103290cdf5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Pickford","original_name":"Mary Pickford","popularity":0.6455,"profile_path":"/y0FHoj9AjmVveKkdeFuqhuVYaTf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Mexican Girl","credit_id":"5a2435ef92514103240c8867","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Hill Mailes","original_name":"Charles Hill Mailes","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/At3GtUXi9WLKero09JGxxVCY6Ph.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Mexican Girl's Father","credit_id":"5a24360692514103360cbb71","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Opperman","original_name":"Frank Opperman","popularity":0.1082,"profile_path":"/hHwmtTj7qfE8Aquzpv8MOkgRQ3k.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Owner of the Gambling Hall","credit_id":"5a243633c3a3680b9a0d4906","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Evans","original_name":"Frank Evans","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Gambler","credit_id":"5eec6987b84cdd00332d7a19","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.C.
