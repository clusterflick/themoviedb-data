Isabel’s father stayed behind fighting in the underground. For six years, they have lived in a new apartment building in East Berlin. At first, the neighbors made an effort to welcome them, but later became more distant. Isabel does not feel at home in the strange country. Not even her friendship to Philip, the neighbors’ son, can change her mind. Almost every day, Isabel sits on the stairs waiting for a letter from her father, from whom she has not heard for many years.","popularity":0.3052,"poster_path":"/gk7GkI07qQweTNrYmi2fajOcRkX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1984-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isabel on the Stairs","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1728585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Gallardo","original_name":"Irina Gallardo","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Isabel","credit_id":"5862a50a9251412b87000094","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1728586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Krüger","original_name":"Mario Krüger","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Philipp","credit_id":"5862a518c3a36852c900008f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1728587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Polle","original_name":"Teresa Polle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Rosita Perez","credit_id":"5862a569c3a36852c90000c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Gröllmann","original_name":"Jenny Gröllmann","popularity":0.1681,"profile_path":"/c3HElIapLL9SolYw5PGs6JrYGGb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Margot Kunze","credit_id":"580542ce92514170b7002ae7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaecki Schwarz","original_name":"Jaecki Schwarz","popularity":0.4399,"profile_path":"/p06smDqMhJ7ykgGa3yeyI8q2PT7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dieter Kunze","credit_id":"580542ebc3a3681db00023c4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Dittus","original_name":"Barbara Dittus","popularity":0.5694,"profile_path":"/xWiAveOZWbGg8brYaDDuAlC21QX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Stellv.
