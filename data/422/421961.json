They decide that they'll experience their relationship with full freedom of feelings, until their love lasts. Andrés is often emotionally ignorant but believes he's doing things well, cursed by the old ways he's been educated into. Ana herself is not even ready for anything new in her life, yet discontented with her new situation. The problems between the couple are not just financial, but more subtle, and inevitably disenchantment appears.","popularity":0.1641,"poster_path":"/iLRWvCYdf29iYLVdt1xssT6QhIh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1377,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ízaro Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":82800,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARIES INTERNACIONAL FILMS, S.A.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1980-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mis relaciones con Ana","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Tiempo de desamor","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Sacristán","original_name":"José Sacristán","popularity":0.3134,"profile_path":"/dT1tMNeRiBHVfpgSKY1EoxiioVw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Andrés","credit_id":"5807f1149251415f4700442e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Luisa San José","original_name":"María Luisa San José","popularity":0.1636,"profile_path":"/lIdbmPQP34P9HmONRzJlKkcmfSt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ana","credit_id":"5807f1209251415dfb0044ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José María Caffarel","original_name":"José María Caffarel","popularity":0.2057,"profile_path":"/pNhFAAydpowE9ve8owPJYI2P860.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"D.
