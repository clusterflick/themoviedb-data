The old dilapidated castle is all he has left and he urgently needs money for renovation. Until now, he earned his living from tourists. But the ghosts, once helpful in scaring the numerous clientele, are staying away, because the whisky cellar is empty. Without ghosts, there are no tourists, no money, no renovation, no whishy, no ghosts.... a vicious circle. Enraged, he decides to get rid of the ghosts once and for all and chases them back to the graveyard where they once came from. There he meets the cemetery gardener Paolo. The two quickly become friends and decide to go to Spain together. Paaolo even owns a boat... But how will he make it to the sea? Can the enchanted fairy help them?","popularity":0.4835,"poster_path":"/cCuWZxk1baLyuFBwAxKUccqNMKK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stockmann Filmverlag","origin_country":""},{"id":31531,"logo_path":null,"name":"Linda Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harold and the Ghosts","video":true,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2488052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renier Baaken","original_name":"Renier Baaken","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Harold McDougal (voice)","credit_id":"6587469f688cd057b284752e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vittorio Alfieri","original_name":"Vittorio Alfieri","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Bat (voice)","credit_id":"658746ed5aba3268f1b8fcb8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1861925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans-Gerd Kilbinger","original_name":"Hans-Gerd Kilbinger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The Owl (voice) / Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"658747052dffd85bcc451035","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Baumeister","original_name":"Heinz Baumeister","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jack (voice)","credit_id":"65874727688cd057b284754e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2488046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Heinz Tafel","original_name":"Karl Heinz Tafel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"King of the Ghosts (voice)","credit_id":"65874741e295b46ffa5839a2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Berg","original_name":"Rolf Berg","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Third Ghost (voice)","credit_id":"65874751072166677fa580c9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2488047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephan Schleberger","original_name":"Stephan Schleberger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Pablo (voice)","credit_id":"6587477e22e4807fb2c0f1d9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4445499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrike Hoetzel","original_name":"Ulrike Hoetzel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Ghostly Lady (voice)","credit_id":"65874794688cd05850842eda","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ursula Karven","original_name":"Ursula Karven","popularity":0.1529,"profile_path":"/3IVP7lmpcm1EM9m20cUdQVyd7Wq.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"58034da9c3a36810f600022f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38813,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Neumann","original_name":"Wolfgang Neumann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65874675325a5158c80120ef","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Curt Linda","original_name":"Curt Linda","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65874682325a515827014fc7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4445496,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Franz J.
