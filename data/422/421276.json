The Cossacks attack the village and massacre almost everyone, and the young Katerina is whipped to death. Before escaping to England, her sister Darya swears to avenge her sister's death. Years later--now one of the world's most famous prima ballerinas--she returns to Russia. Turov falls in love with her and manages to secure a meeting. She coyly asks him to take her to see a prison first. As it turns out, what he has planned for her is nothing compared to what she has planned for him.","popularity":0.2606,"poster_path":"/qE0py60DhGdsrCk0QJUtQBIctrT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cossack Whip","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Dana","original_name":"Viola Dana","popularity":0.0829,"profile_path":"/xkE1eRGSmOdgi4IPfgSWzRiYrEZ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Darya Orlinsky","credit_id":"5953f32e92514168bf00dfea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3301855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Williams","original_name":"Grace Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iBt9Bq6FK0HsMIgnlPFB7h78FnT.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Katerina Orlinsky","credit_id":"61897e7acf62cd002af7d78c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Walker","original_name":"Bob Walker","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":"/a7QWDqRgmbdCkm2BVhmjFGqrUL8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alexis (as Bob Walker)","credit_id":"5953f596c3a3683526020016","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1615589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Farrington","original_name":"Frank Farrington","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/1DNd9Suja5C7cXgANZepMFFilLx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ivan Turov - Cossack Officer","credit_id":"61897d47fe63180044bf2bf2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Tucker","original_name":"Richard Tucker","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/hMHZdVgcSOyhONnAbXNVSKHDwhh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sergius Kordkin","credit_id":"61897d59a313b80042d8d3ad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1142898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Crute","original_name":"Sally Crute","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/j4EAUflh93T6hlZV0eSvTS2XFtx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mme.
