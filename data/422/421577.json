Therefore we adore Cecilia Bartoli for the magnificent performance as the crazy Nina who lost her mind totally. Her magnificent singing, we don't doubt at all, but her acting is amazingly such that it expressed a real situation of a girl becoming crazy and losing her mind caused by painful incidents in her love life. It is also supported by the other singers who are singing matching as perfectly and splendidly as the diva Cecilia Bartoli, especially the baritone Laszlo Polgar with his deep rich voice as the cruel father who has remorse and came back to see his daughter Nina and the young tenor Jonas Kauffmann with his clear light voice, resulting in a surprisingly beautifully performed opera.","popularity":0.2673,"poster_path":"/dTlx5W9IWuVQm37RoFzjiM6vZcs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19492,"logo_path":null,"name":"ArtHaus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Forgotten name but heavenly music and performance","title":"Paisiello Nina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1316133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilia Bartoli","original_name":"Cecilia Bartoli","popularity":0.185,"profile_path":"/wP24X3n757HiJgAbYpZJmwRqDpw.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"5803ac2f9251411bd9002b6f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Kaufmann","original_name":"Jonas Kaufmann","popularity":0.1606,"profile_path":"/phtOzy9kcTClC9mU7N6Mr2q1yFV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lindoro/Pastore","credit_id":"5803ad5f9251411baa002d7b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"László Polgár","original_name":"László Polgár","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/pGGeeJVNRAO77YCDxSOfeMultmt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Il Conte","credit_id":"5803acaf9251411a77002dee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliette Galstian","original_name":"Juliette Galstian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Susanna","credit_id":"5803acd2925141176e002c7e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelo Veccia","original_name":"Angelo Veccia","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Giorgio","credit_id":"5803ad14c3a3681141002c2d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1695484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Federica Bartoli","original_name":"Federica Bartoli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Villanella","credit_id":"5803ad37c3a36810f6002ab8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1695485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Golda Fischer","original_name":"Golda Fischer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Villanella","credit_id":"5803ad4e9251411b7d002bc2","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1564911,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ádám Fischer","original_name":"Ádám Fischer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/iNL3ETqc6rVhdcKDAAzPKsXycdC.jpg","credit_id":"6375bc9c66a7c30077a5e3a3","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cesare Lievi","original_name":"Cesare Lievi","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5803af669251411950002b60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1109273,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bernhard Fleischer","original_name":"Bernhard Fleischer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5803afbb9251411b7d002cf5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1695495,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giovanni Paisiello","original_name":"Giovanni Paisiello","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5803afd69251411983002dda","department":"Crew","job":"Compositors"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1695496,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giovanni Battista Lorenzi","original_name":"Giovanni Battista Lorenzi","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5803aff59251411b7d002d0f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uRF6ILxLK4ZyXX555jJg9ewVhUw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dTlx5W9IWuVQm37RoFzjiM6vZcs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
