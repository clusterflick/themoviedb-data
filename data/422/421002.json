Senior lecturer Sarah Goode believes the most promising way to reduce the number of child-abuse cases is to encourage people to seek treatment before they target victims. Her theory is supported by an interview in this programme in which Humphries meets a man who makes an extraordinary confession on camera.","popularity":0.1497,"poster_path":"/ci77KFLnZvTgrlJIOY1MtCCdEem.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84783,"logo_path":"/FgUZnTXfLk2X4AN3QXisg7lAhb.png","name":"Testimony Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Paedophile Next Door","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Humphries","original_name":"Steve Humphries","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/zPqmsweA92XIHEZxBrSvdu2XESs.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"58b60e079251412ab10013ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Goode","original_name":"Sarah Goode","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self (as Dr Sarah Goode)","credit_id":"58b60ccf9251416129003f7e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corine de Ruiter","original_name":"Corine de Ruiter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Forensic Psychologist (as Prof. Corine de Ruiter)","credit_id":"58b60cf0925141260a00154c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Forsyth","original_name":"Sarah Forsyth","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58b60e27c3a3680678001752","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Chambers","original_name":"Edward Chambers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self (as Eddie)","credit_id":"58b60d53c3a3680f41001330","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Tate","original_name":"Tim Tate","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self - Investigative Journalist","credit_id":"668db01c5a8415d4a132a720","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1767369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Brown","original_name":"Jon Brown","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Head of Strategy, NSPCC","credit_id":"58b60da99251412ab100139f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian McFadyen","original_name":"Ian McFadyen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58b60dd3c3a3687be6001b23","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1887348,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick Maddocks","original_name":"Nick Maddocks","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330e8abe32943007e268682","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1887348,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick Maddocks","original_name":"Nick Maddocks","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330e8b6006b01007e1a3cef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":144215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudolph Herzog","original_name":"Rudolph Herzog","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330e8bd7719d7007ac4c794","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Humphries","original_name":"Steve Humphries","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/zPqmsweA92XIHEZxBrSvdu2XESs.jpg","credit_id":"6330e8c88d2f8d007b01aeff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Humphries","original_name":"Steve Humphries","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/zPqmsweA92XIHEZxBrSvdu2XESs.jpg","credit_id":"58b60a36c3a368059800165f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":144215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudolph Herzog","original_name":"Rudolph Herzog","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b60a23925141260a0013c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4242828","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ci77KFLnZvTgrlJIOY1MtCCdEem.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
