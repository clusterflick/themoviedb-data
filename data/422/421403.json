His son improves but bad luck follows Indranath; his son and daughter die. Unable to stand the grief the Queen/Kalyani loses her mental equilibrium. Goddess Kamala manifests as Rupasi, the daughter of Omkarananda. Virodhananda and his son Tribhanga are the incarnation of Narad and Narayan on earth. The kingdom goes through difficult times. Omkarananda is arrested and Rupasi goes to meet Bastabesh/Indranath who is attracted to her. Rupasi takes refuge in Birodhananda’s house to avoid Bastabesh’s advances. Birodhananda is interested in getting his son Tribhanga married to Rupasi. Bastabesh goes after Rupasi/Kamala who blinds him. Finally the gods perform their miracle and a repentant Bastabesh is restored his sight and kingdom.","popularity":0.0931,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1941-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avatar","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Incarnation","type":"English"},{"iso_3166_1":"BD","title":"Abatar","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"अवतार","type":"Hindi"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"અવતાર","type":"Gujarati"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devidas Bannerjee","original_name":"Devidas Bannerjee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Judge","credit_id":"5802547f9251417a0500278d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1660132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Durgadas Bandyopadhyay","original_name":"Durgadas Bannerjee","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/biCbuIFXqbWQyFODTQq9tTcRMST.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narayan / Tribhanga","credit_id":"5802548d9251417a05002793","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1690382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahindra Choudhury","original_name":"Ahindra Choudhury","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":"/3rqIKd89pAg1fNhBNV5hxVzjQ7A.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Indranath / Bastavesh","credit_id":"5802549e9251417a33002929","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jyotsna Gupta","original_name":"Jyotsna Gupta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kamala / Rupasi","credit_id":"580254aec3a36879bb002417","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":12174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tulsi Lahiri","original_name":"Tulsi Lahiri","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/gXHbsZxLUMb7zoExyERA58oPJDR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narad / Birodhananda","credit_id":"580254ca9251417c5900282f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Panna Rani","original_name":"Panna Rani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Kalyani / Rani","credit_id":"580254de9251415da20032cc","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Premankur Atorthy","original_name":"Premankur Atorthy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5802459e9251417a3300203b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0154182","wikidata_id":"Q18109337","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1941-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
