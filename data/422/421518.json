Collins’ short film marxism today (prologue) (2010) mixes contemporary interviews with the ex-teachers alongside archive material, to form the centrepiece of this exhibition, which also includes a new video in which a number of concepts central to Marxist economic analysis are introduced to a new generation of students. Relocating from the start of this school year to Manchester, where Engels wrote The Condition of the Working Class in England, Collins’ project prompts a wider reflection on the city’s formative place in the history of radical thinking. Initiating a series of interactions with nearby schools and the local public, it also enquires into the continuing relevance of Marxist ideas in the present day.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":"/nPwNGyNdbCi42W7e7k0nWWe7OvO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marxism Today (prologue)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1695232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petra Mgoza-Zeckay","original_name":"Petra Mgoza-Zeckay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Petra Mgoza-Zeckay","credit_id":"5803275ec3a368549e0095a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1695233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Ferber","original_name":"Andrea Ferber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Andrea Ferber","credit_id":"5803276bc3a36873e40033c4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1695234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Klotz","original_name":"Marianne Klotz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Marianne Klotz","credit_id":"58032775c3a36873480036fa","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Collins","original_name":"Phil Collins","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ceb0a530e0a266683cdeaec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4801453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lætitia Sadier","original_name":"Lætitia Sadier","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f431d6b8ffb70aa801878","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5097118,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Powell","original_name":"Nick Powell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674f4366f42e7106fc72c5c1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4145614","wikidata_id":"Q1906175","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nPwNGyNdbCi42W7e7k0nWWe7OvO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
