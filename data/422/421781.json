Judith Myers and her best friend D'arcy Mims are planning a Halloween night camp-out at The Myers House with their friends. Judith is trying to forget the growing tensions in her family and wants to immerse herself in a carefree celebration, but her reclusive brother's presence casts an ominous shadow over their cheerful preparations. This short film breaths life into an often overlooked character from John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN - Judith Myers may have only had a short appearance in the classic film, but she nevertheless played a crucial role in the forming of the Michael Myers story.","popularity":0.1977,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Night She Stayed Home","title":"Judith: The Night She Stayed Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1390427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tara-Nicole Azarian","original_name":"Tara-Nicole Azarian","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":"/vUZtRInBS3CUIgg5QFyO58LLwFu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jamie Perry","credit_id":"636451492ac4990079e77c04","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Hasty","original_name":"Josh Hasty","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/9ALBVPj4gs3coVOdEMib8ggjEFF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Monkey","credit_id":"6364512b336e01007d31ae0c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":174158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Weetman","original_name":"Barbara Weetman","popularity":0.2354,"profile_path":"/2J7cZigFhedlvmq2ZwfrLRMBq38.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Deborah Myers","credit_id":"63645170d8d329007fb1a9b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362168,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kenny Caperton","original_name":"Kenny Caperton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Skeleton Costume Candy Giver","credit_id":"636451b0e61e6d007e061584","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362168,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kenny Caperton","original_name":"Kenny Caperton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636451cc22af3e007eaec498","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Hasty","original_name":"Josh Hasty","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/9ALBVPj4gs3coVOdEMib8ggjEFF.jpg","credit_id":"636450ec9653f6007af4e308","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1615012","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
