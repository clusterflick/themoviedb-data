It is a film of love, comedy, ego and tragedy. The film begins on a humorous note, as the viewer is swept along, enjoying the fun of seeing and listening to people who keep monkeys, ocelots, lion cubs, possums, tarantulas, and every kind of exotic pet imaginable. Along with the careful, concerned people we meet, we also see some who are not quite so responsible. We witness the effects of some of the owners' neglect and lack of sensitivity to the needs of these animals from the wild. Some owners also describe their pets as exhibiting almost human traits, but is it good for animals to lose their own traits and characteristics, and acquire those of human beings?","popularity":0.1492,"poster_path":"/xxceRYhmSASjfa4mQ4S0wzDcqHL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112790,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opus Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manimals","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1393354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Litt","original_name":"Richard Litt","popularity":0.1074,"profile_path":"/6g5B1yqLNDnAJDNv1rywQFfa3hk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self - Voice-over (voice)","credit_id":"649c6faefd4f8000ecb3eaf7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Lehman","original_name":"Robin Lehman","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/8IATvPCzbwl6k92nNdrYYi0rqEX.jpg","credit_id":"5804390c92514126610018a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Lehman","original_name":"Robin Lehman","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/8IATvPCzbwl6k92nNdrYYi0rqEX.jpg","credit_id":"649c5e6cc392660125bfc560","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Lehman","original_name":"Robin Lehman","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/8IATvPCzbwl6k92nNdrYYi0rqEX.jpg","credit_id":"649c6f2b77c01f00ae8f7add","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Lehman","original_name":"Robin Lehman","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/8IATvPCzbwl6k92nNdrYYi0rqEX.jpg","credit_id":"649c6f36af58cb00e2a84943","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15365,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kelly Van Horn","original_name":"Kelly Van Horn","popularity":0.1725,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649c6f5b77c01f00ca5ac381","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Lehman","original_name":"Robin Lehman","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/8IATvPCzbwl6k92nNdrYYi0rqEX.jpg","credit_id":"649c6f7afd4f80014f97f42f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0318425","wikidata_id":"Q123288521","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5sUgkpiu9iNIcJRA5lzJHiRcdA5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1916},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n9T2FovOEByq0O3tUt4iO4SmYcp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1916}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1523,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xxceRYhmSASjfa4mQ4S0wzDcqHL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1015}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne Int'l Film Festival (Grand Prize)","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cork Film Festival","release_date":"1978-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"1978-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Chicago Int'l Film Festival (Silver Plaque)","release_date":"1978-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Greater Miami Int'l Film Festival (Gold - David Salzburg Memorial Award)","release_date":"1978-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Francisco Film Festival (Silver Award)","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
