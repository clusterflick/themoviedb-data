Bose) and his magic 'Open Sesame' formula; of the hero's jealous brother Kasim and the slave girl Marjina (S. Bose). The film adapts the 1897 play, giving it a Hollywood-derived exotic flavour. An improvised 'modern' dance is inserted. The slow, mannered acting with the frontally framed tableau shots are enlivened by the dance scenes, especially the Marjina-Abdallah sequence.","popularity":0.1317,"poster_path":"/eAGoDYY5KpjSCsDaSIF5gGh7jvE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1937-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alibaba","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Modhu Bose","original_name":"Modhu Bose","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/mY0qnILqH9DNn9dfmc4zfjpHwC0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Abdullah","credit_id":"58010bf3925141400f007053","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sadhona Bose","original_name":"Sadhona Bose","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Marjina","credit_id":"58010c02c3a3686b1000664f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1694517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Indira Roy","original_name":"Indira Roy","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sakina","credit_id":"58010c209251414012006f59","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bibhuti Ganguly","original_name":"Bibhuti Ganguly","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Alibaba","credit_id":"58010c2fc3a3686b040069af","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1661175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Preeti Majumdar","original_name":"Preeti Majumdar","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Baba Mustafa","credit_id":"58010c439251414007006e33","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suprova Mukerjee","original_name":"Suprova Mukerjee","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/7Xvgn12osR3I0WGIW59xo5lCLZx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Fatima","credit_id":"6731f2d00f3f5a4a09a678f7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Modhu Bose","original_name":"Modhu Bose","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/mY0qnILqH9DNn9dfmc4zfjpHwC0.jpg","credit_id":"58010bd8c3a3686b1000663a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0156275","wikidata_id":"","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eAGoDYY5KpjSCsDaSIF5gGh7jvE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":668}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
