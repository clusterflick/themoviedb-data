Проект Леонида Парфёнова","overview":"Weeks-long filming in major capitals and dozens of journeys across both the former and present territories of the country. These are unique locations where a television camera has never been before: from a Polish village once visited by Peter the Great to the roof of the Hermitage. They include German towns that gave birth to Russian empresses, sites of military glory of the Russian army — from Rome to Beirut — and places of national tragedy, from Sevastopol to East Prussia. Along the way are historical anecdotes, authentic diaries, previously unknown documents, and letters from the leading figures of the empire.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/ePtYb539UOqv6lC2EvzeTq4eE3t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":896,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Russian Empire.
