Shot in 1993, the film captures a transient slice of post-’80s, pre-Y2K youth culture on the eve of a new century. Following a tribe of teenage heshers and burnouts at a skate park punk show, the film is a snapshot of the stray children of the boomer generation as they navigate their anxieties on the brink of social, global, and digital upheaval.  Now, on its 30th anniversary, the original VHS tape has been restored in 4K, revealing a cultural time capsule of pre-9/11 American youth; a candid documentation of a moment both electric and uncanny.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8Red5KE99GvYOUHbD2GRnAoLBve.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memorex - 30th Anniversary Special Edition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Zhort","original_name":"Alex Zhort","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/9kQeprPoiua7lpgQSisERNZaywy.jpg","credit_id":"68b7066bfcd47c2ed93f0c4c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Zhort","original_name":"Alex Zhort","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/9kQeprPoiua7lpgQSisERNZaywy.jpg","credit_id":"68b70697d327df38fa20143e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4454362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Cotrufo","original_name":"Nick Cotrufo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b706a91c658d8eed3f0a2f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5666256,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Micah Pick","original_name":"Micah Pick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b706d9c429144b643f0a2f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5666257,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benjamin Mauch","original_name":"Benjamin Mauch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b706ecc429144b643f0a3d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38106076","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/67pcxHOQZ79wG5GAQcgGkbhiLPI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8Red5KE99GvYOUHbD2GRnAoLBve.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11616,"name":"vhs"},{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"},{"id":210608,"name":"1990s"},{"id":228192,"name":"skater"},{"id":276764,"name":"punk"},{"id":323202,"name":"vhs tapes"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
