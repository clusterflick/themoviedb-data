Holmes has moved on and now has a new girlfriend (Tracey Lixx) who’s the sheriff of the next county. But Clifford Pierce (David Lee) wants to become the New Necktie Strangler and starts the cycle of murder all over again! Pierce does run into a problem when he’s interrupted while strangling his first victim (Laura Giglio) and is forced to return another day to get his “trophy”. Will he be stopped by Holmes or his deputies? And what of The Necktie Strangler himself? Has he really been in a coma for the last 10 years? Or will he once again track down Holmes’ girlfriend and deputy and kill them both?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rGW12wuKXxG4OMNRBozrlAJSosw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60390,"logo_path":"/tm2yOVUsJJNqQ0MYpL7hjejNCCJ.png","name":"W.A.V.E.
