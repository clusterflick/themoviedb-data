Named after the notorious Soviet people's commissar Nikolai Yezhov (with \"yezh\" meaning \"hedgehog\" in Russian), these seemingly innocent desserts became a spooky symbol of terror. According to speculative theories, hedgehog cakes were not just treats but served as secret signals of inescapable danger, marking recipients for possible exile to Siberian camps or even death.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2025-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Hedgehog Cakes: Sweet Weapon of Terror","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5668154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhenia Stepanenko","original_name":"Женя Степаненко","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b81ca2bdb8f736629bad45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5668155,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vitalii Nemchenko","original_name":"Vitalii Nemchenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b81cf666584852359babdc","department":"Production","job":"Coordinating Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5668157,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mykhailo Bondariev","original_name":"Mykhailo Bondariev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b81d0624af1eee5498a61b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BFI London Film Festival","release_date":"2025-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
