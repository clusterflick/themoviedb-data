The appeals denied. But the battle over one of Britain’s most chilling and controversial criminal cases is just beginning.  Lucy Letby is serving 15 whole-life sentences after being found guilty of murdering seven babies and attempting to kill seven more. The case transfixed the nation, but following the verdicts, questions about her guilt become urgent and unsettling.  Conviction: The Lucy Letby Case is a gripping, bold, feature documentary that delves into the turbulent fallout of the trial. The film follows three strands: Letby’s new lawyer, accused by some of the victims' families of turning the case into a spectacle; a prosecution expert whose combative approach starts to cast doubt on his credibility; and an affected family speaking emotionally for the first time about their experience and the impact of the renewed controversy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2600,"logo_path":"/ePDVrW3gJCd3kxi8ucLckJoG3Bu.png","name":"Blast!
