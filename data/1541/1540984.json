Forming a cooperative, they soon discover that the marketplace surprisingly cannot support their simple ambitions. Jackson and Teale follow their efforts for two years, through near collapse to an uncertain future, exposing in microcosm the struggles of small-scale farming in our modern, industrial world. Through intimate, character-driven chronicle of the group's struggle Grazers illuminates timely issues regarding our food system. At stake are their farms, the small communities around them, the health of the land and a way of life.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14444,"logo_path":null,"name":"Collective Eye Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grazers: A Cooperative Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa F.
