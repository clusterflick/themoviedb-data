Using a cantaloup and the three artist/designers as source material, Steina explains the capabilities of the machine, including its real-time imaging ability and the articulation of images in a digital code. She describes the varying sizes of pixels (picture elements), the layers (or slices) of color and tone that can be derived from one image, and techniques such as \"grabbing\" the image and multiplying it. This document offers an informative demonstration of a complex imaging device.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cantaloup","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5665828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Schier","original_name":"Jeffrey Schier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68b6d8c21993120f591f2d41","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1462455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Woody Vasulka","original_name":"Woody Vasulka","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68b6d8d4fd136946b73f0a13","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steina Vasulka","original_name":"Steina Vasulka","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b6d83e78edceaf8a3f049b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
