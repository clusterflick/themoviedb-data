The second part, “Zor Yıllar,” takes the audience to a time of rebellion and hope, looking at Turkey’s history through the lens of events that took place at the university between 1964–1980. The film also bears witness to key moments such as the burning of U.S. Ambassador Comer’s car by students; the resignation of then-rector Kemal Kurdaş, who opposed the students’ demand to bury METU student Taylan Özgür—killed in the first unsolved murder of the 1968 movement—on campus.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/oXZgTmtFqTIFHl1wBB1mNM04Lcp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"If a light is on after midnight in a room, it means there’s a METU student working there.","title":"ODTÜ Tarihi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5666410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Berrin Balay Tuncer","original_name":"Berrin Balay Tuncer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b715599b047485ea9e28d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5666413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Önder M.
