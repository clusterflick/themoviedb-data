The couples and their families illustrate why overcoming the obstacles to legal nuptials is worthwhile - despite the reality that once back home south of the border, the newlyweds will remain merely 'married in Canada,' with their marital status going unrecognized. With unfettered access to the brides and grooms on their wedding days, the film follows the most meaningful ceremony of their lives. In this first-ever documentary about human rights and cross-border same-sex marriage, Married in Canada explores the strength and conviction of lovers in their fight for equality.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/mFmgPczhp5MBqRDoKkBRswIw2UL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Married in Canada","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1866491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Connell","original_name":"Phil Connell","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6463ba24ef8b32011b156b68","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arriane Robinson","original_name":"Arriane Robinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6da2ce0e0a265f1001b252","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1945136","wikidata_id":"Q6772945","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mFmgPczhp5MBqRDoKkBRswIw2UL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
