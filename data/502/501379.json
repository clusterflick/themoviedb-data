She has since become a total hermit and spends her time creating art out of rocks from the nearby creek. It is a never-ending project. Ingrid peels off the layers of this woman's persona, questioning what would drive a successful Texas fashion designer to leave her profession and family to immerse herself in nature and become an entirely self sufficient woman of the woods.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/d1Fk3fCQkuztF57lJK3UzPypmov.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ingrid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2027356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morrisa Maltz","original_name":"Morrisa Maltz","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/kK8HuKXzaGHWdSzC1Z0NdHFtl5S.jpg","credit_id":"5adba5a1c3a36862bd011e05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7304166","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1483,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d1Fk3fCQkuztF57lJK3UzPypmov.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1112}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Кинофестиваль «Слэмдэнс»","release_date":"2018-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
