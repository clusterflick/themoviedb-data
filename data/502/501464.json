In this film we created our imagined/faked versions of “the moon on the river” by collaging material we filmed in various remote locations across America, from the Florida Keys to Ohio, to the islands of Washington State (including “Moon River” in Georgia, the birthplace of Johnny Mercer). Elements used to create the “illusion” include hotel soaps, swimming pools, cathedral holy water, pool slides, moon rocks at the Kennedy Space Center, etc.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I’m Floating in a Beam of Light With You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denise Burge","original_name":"Denise Burge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6ddc21c3a368555201b27d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
