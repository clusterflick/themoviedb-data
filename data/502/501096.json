The sketches this time include a send-up of The Fugitive — Richard Kimble is now a veterinarian on the lam. Despite the danger, he must intervene whenever he sees a cat (always Michael) suffering; after treating the patient, he plays a trick on the cat and runs away. Another sketch draws parallels between wandering husbands and wandering house cats, who seem to have similar proclivities. Two more point out what happens when a cat's instincts run up against the requirements of baseball or pro wrestling.","popularity":1.3318,"poster_path":"/b4hnuReccgubDewdxFtKN4EbbNq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4766,"logo_path":"/9t3tuuujb3g1YRaQSJKM5v21e1Q.png","name":"Kitty Films","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1988-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What's Michael? 2","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroshi Ôtake","original_name":"大竹 宏","popularity":0.5382,"profile_path":"/zRYEb1k75S05xwyBZ2uSko1W4IY.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Michael (voice)","credit_id":"5a6b6b940e0a26244f0013e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":549566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eiko Yamada","original_name":"山田栄子","popularity":0.5893,"profile_path":"/uIESaPrL2AxOaYyfmh6krMVe813.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mrs. Ōbayashi (voice)","credit_id":"5a6b6ba2c3a36872cf0014a9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideyuki Tanaka","original_name":"田中秀幸","popularity":0.9212,"profile_path":"/1D1PmELZexM6aod77gbh9GwvvGG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mr. Ōbayashi (voice)","credit_id":"5a6b6bb0c3a36872d5001140","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ichiro Nagai","original_name":"永井一郎","popularity":0.8324,"profile_path":"/d5LuqwoIjMIqKvKmEk5y6AZY1Ww.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a6b6bbcc3a36872c50011ca","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hirotaka Suzuoki","original_name":"鈴置洋孝","popularity":0.6376,"profile_path":"/6tUnO95OZiUwhHvxlJ3WP5lcsaJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dr. Richard Kimble (voice)","credit_id":"5e754efdc4ad590016fdab07","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naoto Takenaka","original_name":"竹中直人","popularity":0.9914,"profile_path":"/4adcQdMnaqOnl1rtOVUqGp1flvo.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Takechi (voice)","credit_id":"5e754f14357c0000134df30b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":547982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yusaku Yara","original_name":"屋良有作","popularity":0.6931,"profile_path":"/73cpMM1uWJiiZ1u4BymUQmTb22j.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lt.
