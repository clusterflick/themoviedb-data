Turgidity was filmed at an automotive testing facility during the making of one of his sculptures, which involves crashing a car into a steel pole. The video shows nearly four seconds of high-resolution footage from the crash, gradually slowed to a halt, and then reversed. The result is a mesmerizing slow-motion depiction of the car's destruction and the sculpture's creation. The soundtrack includes audio from the impact, as well as of the artist's heartbeat.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turgidity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dirk Skreber","original_name":"Dirk Skreber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6b8da79251414e2c003be9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
