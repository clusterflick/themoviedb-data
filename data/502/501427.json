Greg Stewart, his wisecracking husband, Stillman, and their five adopted sons. In a risky, emotionally charged five-year odyssey through the American heartland they realize that, when it comes to racism and homophobia, where you live determines how you live. Every one of the Stewarts is compelling, charismatic, flawed, and unforgettable. Come peer behind closed doors, into their bedrooms and family rooms - they open their home and hearts for you. Laugh and sigh and squirm, and then decide what impact this kind of family will have on love and marriage in America.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/9FX4aE53F8JDhMILuQiwuW5GHxH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Preacher's Sons","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Celia Roebuck Reed","original_name":"Celia Roebuck Reed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6da1eb92514107570152e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1338660","wikidata_id":"Q7239291","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9FX4aE53F8JDhMILuQiwuW5GHxH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
