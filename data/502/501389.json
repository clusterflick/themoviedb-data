He is known and respected all over the world but to his beautiful daughter, radio personality, Audrey Caine, he is an absentee parent. Nevertheless, Caine tries to heal the break between him and his daughter only to be called away to give another lecture on ants to a secretive multi-national corporation, Niles Industries, hidden in the Colorado wilderness. Meanwhile, his daughter, Audrey, is worried more than she’d like to admit. But when a giant ant escapes so does Caine. The giant ant sends out a sonic signal that travels across the four corners of the world and suddenly giant ants are appearing everywhere!","popularity":0.4735,"poster_path":"/281xkyOqjCUZLBxU7BFbe3ddZnT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Excel Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GiAnts","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"アース・トゥルーパーズ地球防衛軍VS巨大蟻軍団","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Атака гигантских муравьев","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Earth Troopers: Earth Defense Force vs. Giant Ant Army!","type":"Translated"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Μυρμήγκια Δολοφόνοι","type":"DVD title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Novak","original_name":"Mel Novak","popularity":0.3156,"profile_path":"/eQTGz7obqHaNda1GaBapRK4Xn37.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jonathan Caine","credit_id":"5a6d54a3925141075d0110dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1171099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Desiree Berg","original_name":"Tina Desiree Berg","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":"/tnOWkDZEvo0e9CE5Vy8sKzSLf2F.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Audrey Caine","credit_id":"5a6d54bb0e0a265f01017091","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":80580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Rabago","original_name":"Richard Rabago","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Josh Jung","credit_id":"5a6d54dd925141076c01103d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1000089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alden Ray","original_name":"Alden Ray","popularity":0.2075,"profile_path":"/aQezNo2eiJEWnuKrQ9HfFp5c2sP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pud","credit_id":"5a6d54f0925141076c01104f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin McKay","original_name":"Colin McKay","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/2xmGojkGfRLdoMkC4VAFW7cc6PC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"General Bonniville","credit_id":"5a6d55080e0a265f070170cf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":566939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tadashi Yamashita","original_name":"Tadashi Yamashita","popularity":0.2824,"profile_path":"/eSCbxdhoTC4iSrbwWr5KflwZcVz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Joe Williamson","credit_id":"5d0866d592514101b2b85138","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2103349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julio Urquidi","original_name":"Julio Urquidi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Corporal Derek","credit_id":"5e16d9ef0cb335001304c494","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2504735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Ericson","original_name":"Brandon Ericson","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mayor Foley","credit_id":"5e16da111d01910017f17af7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2504736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Ramolete","original_name":"Ed Ramolete","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Chief Ramos","credit_id":"5e16da1f11386c0013c92ada","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2504738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliott Caine","original_name":"Elliott Caine","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Bob","credit_id":"5e16da541d01910015f173d2","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585170,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"B.J.
