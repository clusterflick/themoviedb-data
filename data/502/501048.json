Asked about his origins, Umar begins to tell his story: he comes from a modest background and is separated from his mother after his father dies and his stepfather is banished. His subsequent trials and tribulations are marked by slavery, and he is put to any number of tests until he finally becomes the adopted son of his Arabic master Abdulkarim. He attends Quranic school and is made an imam upon reaching adulthood. Following a particular dream, he resolves to search for his mother.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6bsdGUPZ8ieVWzi6M6waLoSFYLC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fedfilms Nigeria Features","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","name":"Nigeria"}],"release_date":"1976-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hausa","iso_639_1":"ha","name":"Hausa"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shaihu Umar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","title":"Shehu Umar","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4991439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umaru Ladan","original_name":"Umaru Ladan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Shaihu Umar","credit_id":"670736f76718012fc23370ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4991441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mairiga Aliyu","original_name":"Mairiga Aliyu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fatima","credit_id":"6707370ed0616c7b19fb167f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4991442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Husaini Mohammed","original_name":"Husaini Mohammed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Umar (3 years up)","credit_id":"6707373cc92c2e56d8611769","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4991443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umaru Dembo","original_name":"Umaru Dembo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Makau","credit_id":"6707374a200b5388b555f39b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4991444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Assad Yasin","original_name":"Assad Yasin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Abdulkarim","credit_id":"6707375f1d96dc6d4769f0a1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4991445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harira Kachia","original_name":"Harira Kachia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Kaka","credit_id":"6707376f200b5388b555f3ae","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adamu Halilu","original_name":"Adamu Halilu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6b29040e0a260c87005b6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0075207","wikidata_id":"Q113320697","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ohhOHfkQfpHQLhDaPL6615IsiyH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":2161,"iso_639_1":"ha","file_path":"/6bsdGUPZ8ieVWzi6M6waLoSFYLC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1517},{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":753,"iso_639_1":"ha","file_path":"/lL0MJTNpBRcrT8VLJH3s9LVVy9J.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
