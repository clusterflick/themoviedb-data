In Sanrizuka, people were weary of the violence and the airport was well under construction. As for Ogawa Productions, they invited criticism by pulling out and moving to a quiet village in northern Japan. But when protesters back in Sanrizuka erected a tall tower at the end of one runway, they sent a crew to document what happened. This became the final film of the Sanrizuka Series.","popularity":0.2462,"poster_path":"/jeQIERlSKvfE20N4E3yX0n8C70a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ogawa Productions","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1977-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sanrizuka: The Sky of May","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2316926,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hiroo Fuseya","original_name":"Hiroo Fuseya","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629afdc894d8a8111de21f84","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386252,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Iizuka Toshio","original_name":"Iizuka Toshio","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629afdd16dc50700a397bfd7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3573782,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Setsuko Asahi","original_name":"Setsuko Asahi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629afdedec0c58006687caec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2491936,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tatsuo Takahashi","original_name":"Tatsuo Takahashi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629afe457ad08c009ea79046","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1695717,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yukio Kubota","original_name":"Yukio Kubota","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629afe52a44d095275efed9e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2804974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takaaki Watanabe","original_name":"Takaaki Watanabe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629afe7c988afd126b4c607a","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fukuda Katsuhiko","original_name":"Fukuda Katsuhiko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629afe89bdd568006671e40c","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1001012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinsuke Ogawa","original_name":"小川紳介","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/mMYATdAymePuhX9W93OT0P9Vcus.jpg","credit_id":"5a6e286f0e0a265f04025b73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70631,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Masaki Tamura","original_name":"たむらまさき","popularity":0.1622,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f662e311b1f3c003aa61d1f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0241919","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jeQIERlSKvfE20N4E3yX0n8C70a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
