Baseball buffs still sing the praises of Josh Gibson who could be counted on to hit 70 homeruns in a season, and Satchel Paige who pitched over 100 no-hitters in his career. Only the Ball Was White pays tribute to the many topflight players from the Negro Leagues. Narrated by actor Paul Winfield, the program documents a bygone bittersweet era in baseball and the men who were denied stardom by the color line. Ballplayers throughout the country were interviewed for this program, all of them quick to tell tales of the life, the competition, and the camaraderie. These include: Satchel Paige, Roy Campanella, Buck Leonard, Jimmy Crutchfield, David Malarcher, Effa Manley, and Quincy Trouppe.","popularity":0.7048,"poster_path":"/sXU0hnQ8vsZsHaDDIwr4QyES71q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50946,"logo_path":"/1lTs6kx4LNc48mypKt9F0y5X3XH.png","name":"WTTW/Chicago","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Inspirational Documentary About the Forgotten Athletes of Baseball's Negro League","title":"Only the Ball Was White","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Winfield","original_name":"Paul Winfield","popularity":0.9011,"profile_path":"/6NLUJEFJCJ2Hog1ZOz4K2iyDvMZ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a6e9dc4c3a368554102b966","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ken Solarz","original_name":"Ken Solarz","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6e9e05925141075a024161","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968718,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jay Tannenbaum","original_name":"Jay Tannenbaum","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6ea2610e0a265efb02cbfb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968719,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"G.
