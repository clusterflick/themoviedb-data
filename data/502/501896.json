Voices of longtime residents of Los Sures, a mostly Puerto Rican neighborhood, are juxtaposed with images suggesting a recently disappearing past. The film weaves their stories, reflecting unique glimpses into collective memory of a place undergoing rapid changes. Through explorations of urban space, the film unearths fragments of history and culture, and recreates those memories through video, photography, archival documents and animation.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":100319,"logo_path":null,"name":"UnionDocs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Of Memory & Los Sures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1969529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Parsons","original_name":"Andrew Parsons","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/wb2E7DCXwOrhKcD9vb3cmNRFM4x.jpg","credit_id":"5a708750925141374b00f5c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1969528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurie Sumiye","original_name":"Laurie Sumiye","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gBqdfF00s2oerffRaOgRvJFSSMG.jpg","credit_id":"5a7087e50e0a26795f01288b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1969528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurie Sumiye","original_name":"Laurie Sumiye","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gBqdfF00s2oerffRaOgRvJFSSMG.jpg","credit_id":"5a70873f925141375100f030","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1969529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Parsons","original_name":"Andrew Parsons","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/wb2E7DCXwOrhKcD9vb3cmNRFM4x.jpg","credit_id":"5a7087f4c3a368480000f78b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2355759","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"ofmemoryandlossures","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4ri5Gzt1bpizKCVRcS10gLpJub2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
