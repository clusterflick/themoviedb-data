Wildly creative and experimental in form, A Thousand Thoughts is a meditation on music itself-the act of listening closely to music, the experience of feeling music deeply, and the power that music has to change the world. Green narrates the piece live onstage while the Kronos Quartet performs the score, and a rich blend of archival footage, photos, and interviews with members of the Kronos Quartet – as well as longtime collaborators like Philip Glass, Laurie Anderson, Terry Riley, Tanya Tagaq, and Steve Reich – unspools on screen.","popularity":0.2778,"poster_path":"/d38RlKeFdm0Kl954IvScf2YcvV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187742,"logo_path":null,"name":"ArKtype","origin_country":""},{"id":89142,"logo_path":"/bfMAgFDoS5niHK077WKdoUMgLHp.png","name":"Department of Motion Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":217325,"logo_path":null,"name":"C41","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Thousand Thoughts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3950933,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Petr Shchepilov","original_name":"Petr Shchepilov","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/yOlEKKQoFTTDsYTHPZuRKmM31Ma.jpg","credit_id":"654796b01ac2927b2dcdc117","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Green","original_name":"Sam Green","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":"/6sRPUQdXw4dtgx7NkWLEHXBZlVh.jpg","credit_id":"658d84ef20e6a56ef58b4708","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Green","original_name":"Sam Green","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":"/6sRPUQdXw4dtgx7NkWLEHXBZlVh.jpg","credit_id":"658d866b20e6a566e18b47c4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Green","original_name":"Sam Green","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":"/6sRPUQdXw4dtgx7NkWLEHXBZlVh.jpg","credit_id":"5a6b8190c3a36872e6002dfc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6827,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joe Bini","original_name":"Joe Bini","popularity":0.0651,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f77e99cf8e982003870ed65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117841,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirsten Johnson","original_name":"Kirsten Johnson","popularity":0.3191,"profile_path":"/9h1DYSYLnPujVBtM4mklFDnZByj.jpg","credit_id":"5f77e9aee039f10039e6989e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7856368","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d38RlKeFdm0Kl954IvScf2YcvV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.721,"height":777,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5IA9Z6rBgOiHsFM6NHCY1PikxfS.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":560},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":945,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xA6wX4FVmPtdoaC69CM5oWcP47x.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
