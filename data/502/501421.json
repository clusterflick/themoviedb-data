Individual chapters are devoted to such topics as Jang's idiosyncratic hairstyle and the controversy surrounding his previous feature Lies. The documentary tries to place Jang and his work in the widest possible social context, not only in the context of Korean cinema. At its heart is a series of remarkably candid and revealing interviews with Jang himself.","popularity":0.3383,"poster_path":"/8emnQK3qeSMY4WaARBnRI8eQDNt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2001-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jang Sun-woo Variations","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jang Sun-woo","original_name":"장선우","popularity":0.1973,"profile_path":"/wlMuLZYJwEZ5E85Ufvck1CJPluq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a6d9f7b0e0a265f0a01ba9a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moon Sung-keun","original_name":"문성근","popularity":0.5949,"profile_path":"/wQjOvAFqCItwMw7dxa486KnGgEE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a6d9f880e0a265f1001af19","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Byun Young-joo","original_name":"변영주","popularity":0.3471,"profile_path":"/tsJHdphVtZkq4bA3LJR5i1Ga42U.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a6d9f9d925141076c0152ed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":145624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sang Hyun Lee","original_name":"Sang Hyun Lee","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a6d9fec925141075a014e74","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Joong-hoon","original_name":"박중훈","popularity":0.4724,"profile_path":"/bMkwv1Se8w5qKNztrYgbmIAVqXB.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Himself (uncredited)","credit_id":"6023faad0e597b003fa8686e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68466,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shin Chul","original_name":"신철","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zKJ0qSI69WQ0ECkhNSAohev5n4P.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a6da05f0e0a265f0a01bb57","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1495747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Jin-seong","original_name":"Park Jin-seong","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639b5a22ecc7e800cab304b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Rayns","original_name":"Tony Rayns","popularity":0.1064,"profile_path":"/z1NV3lUMGgW1qSwJURdSXgSzlYV.jpg","credit_id":"5a6d9edf0e0a265f1001ae6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Ki-yong","original_name":"박기용","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/fpkGdotcLMkkbB2IA3V4eSjQKn4.jpg","credit_id":"5a6d9f2b925141076c015272","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552077,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kim Woo-hyung","original_name":"김우형","popularity":0.2372,"profile_path":"/FxG9RriwnGFaWDU3hG8gNxVzvr.jpg","credit_id":"5c5c17860e0a2659ab63017c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0274579","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xJQBC5ZMvVoodBhDphAmID0iUqd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1457,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ezwh8iQNk4AMVNuAhsy9cQW2mva.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8emnQK3qeSMY4WaARBnRI8eQDNt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2001-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
