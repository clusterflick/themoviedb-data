The gardens represent their hobby, their freedom and their living space, which exists side by side with hard work. They cannot however own these \"homes\" and the film shows the chronicle of the events which took place in 1976 - 77 when construction of the Zurich wholesale market hall destroyed 150 gardens and made many people \"homeless\". This portrait of a group is complemented by the stories of three individuals.","popularity":0.1063,"poster_path":"/kaN0lf0HpNleXFg5WhI39bMaemh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nemo Film AG","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1978-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Sailer","original_name":"Franz Sailer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a6e5757c3a3685559025618","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Bruggmann","original_name":"Alex Bruggmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a6e5766925141075d0209ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trudy Bruggmann","original_name":"Trudy Bruggmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a6e57710e0a265f0d026c55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Giezendanner","original_name":"Bruno Giezendanner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a6e577f0e0a265f10026e89","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1857806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans-Ulrich Schlumpf","original_name":"Hans-Ulrich Schlumpf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6e57b70e0a265f070276d9","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69931,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pio Corradi","original_name":"Pio Corradi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6e57c40e0a265f0a027ec6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1857806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans-Ulrich Schlumpf","original_name":"Hans-Ulrich Schlumpf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6e57af0e0a265f04028a5a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549568,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Florian Eidenbenz","original_name":"Florian Eidenbenz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6e57d00e0a265f10026ed3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968643,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Benni Lehmann","original_name":"Benni Lehmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6e5802c3a368555902568f","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1968641,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hans Künzi","original_name":"Hans Künzi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/iffBBMY6tQzvdnXRZ6bHaP0mHz0.jpg","credit_id":"5a6e57df9251410766020bcc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Balz Raz","original_name":"Balz Raz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/AjTdJzWVfwPrvoSu3bf4f3jpI0q.jpg","credit_id":"5a6e57ee0e0a265f04028a83","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1857806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans-Ulrich Schlumpf","original_name":"Hans-Ulrich Schlumpf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6e57a4c3a3685544027bd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608384,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Begert","original_name":"Peter Begert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6e5819925141075d020a59","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0077810","wikidata_id":"Q88873295","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kaN0lf0HpNleXFg5WhI39bMaemh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
