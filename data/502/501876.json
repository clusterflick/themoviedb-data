Their temporality and after-images can be seen within a framework of 30fps by switching between two states of spatial folding. The camera has the task of following these events and is hovering through the architecture in an interplay with the randomly moving light source.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rMhiSXgzbCyfdNFVQH0wBHX1mUY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Momentum 142310","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Knapp","original_name":"Manuel Knapp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a70675ec3a368481c00f1a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":770,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rMhiSXgzbCyfdNFVQH0wBHX1mUY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
