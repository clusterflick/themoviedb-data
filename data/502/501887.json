The president seems to be getting in deeper and deeper. Special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating if Trump colluded with Russia in order to win the elections, is also digging into Trump's past. In that past, one of Donald Trump's business partners plays a crucial role, Felix Sater. A convicted felon who has ties with the Russian mafia. Last May, Zembla disclosed how an American real estate company, co-owned by Sater, used Dutch mailbox companies within a network, which has been suspected of laundering money. Presumably, $1.5 million dollars had been diverted. Donald Trump built hotels and apartment blocks with this suspicious company.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/vRP94Pd6493MYvZoxRhFFp3lxGW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29459,"logo_path":"/el8phAL6Xa6vXvvaQNiELmEOgx8.png","name":"VARA","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zembla - The Dubious Friends of Donald Trump Part 3: The Billion Dollar Fraud","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7GM6HZyzDwikQTOmaoirEWu3sqS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AmaiG3h5yq96WctBIyLPYEd0Dzl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vRP94Pd6493MYvZoxRhFFp3lxGW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Watch ZEMBLA: The dubious friends of Donald Trump part 3: The billion dollar fraud.","key":"oqesw5kwEow","published_at":"2017-09-27T19:47:37.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b85a62592514123e700045c"}]}}}
