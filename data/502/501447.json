Though his work and his life are rather dull, he at least gets along somewhat well with his young daughter. He recieves a phone call one day, informing him of the sudden death of one of his colleagues. Shortly after this shocking news, his wife who is now living apart cuts him down further by telling him, \"You don't see anything.\" While walking in the night, Ichiro is struck by an idea: why don't we go there? He heads off holding his daughter's hand. And thus begins a strange little tale of an ordinary father and his daughter.","popularity":0.1677,"poster_path":"/uDDuB7v5LQ2c0GXdrnRnTU79ofc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53391,"logo_path":"/7aPeLmQjH1EFhqAXWLyyxZ535QA.png","name":"Tokyo University of the Arts","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Play Cards When You Die","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yukiya Kitamura","original_name":"北村有起哉","popularity":0.6009,"profile_path":"/qbUKeVee8IPNHZ2aelTDWbGkx7P.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae86b8d9251410cd9018f54","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayumi Kimura","original_name":"Ayumi Kimura","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae86b980e0a2610700180e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chieko Misaka","original_name":"三坂知絵子","popularity":0.3612,"profile_path":"/kQ2jKprQ67QU2E7RrpyFJ4U3ruP.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae86ba5c3a3681370011138","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yūko Genkaku","original_name":"玄覺悠子","popularity":0.259,"profile_path":"/8XbgHfFsutlTpJAAgFovtfKPiHs.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae86bb0c3a368136a014f7a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noboru Mitani","original_name":"三谷昇","popularity":0.3005,"profile_path":"/8GyyDIWLnbxhli156RSDdm9nXTO.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae86bc0c3a368137001113d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mai Nishino","original_name":"Mai Nishino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6dc8db0e0a265f0d01d487","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033809,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Norie Miyatake","original_name":"Norie Miyatake","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae86b36c3a368134801b741","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033810,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Motoharu Honda","original_name":"Motoharu Honda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae86b4d0e0a261060019242","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033807,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ayako Hozumi","original_name":"Ayako Hozumi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae86b060e0a26104f018581","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenichi Sakita","original_name":"Kenichi Sakita","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae86b1b0e0a26105e018864","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033811,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hiroki Takahara","original_name":"Hiroki Takahara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae86b63c3a36813430186e9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033805,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Kenta Gokan","original_name":"後閑健太","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae86ad8c3a368135d01166d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033812,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tsunako Tokuda","original_name":"Tsunako Tokuda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae86b76c3a3681345016782","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033806,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hiroki Matsuura","original_name":"松浦大樹","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae86aed9251410d340167c9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mai Nishino","original_name":"Mai Nishino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae86ac60e0a261075018ff4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3628792","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uDDuB7v5LQ2c0GXdrnRnTU79ofc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
