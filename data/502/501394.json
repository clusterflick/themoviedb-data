Several invoke, directly, the work of the Lumieres, as in Frampton's reworking of DEMOLITION D'UN MUR (1895) in which a dilapidated farm silo is demolished in place of the Lumieres' wall. He makes reference to his own work and plays homage to the work of contemporaries. A complex range of formal issues are raised in other fragments. Finally, Frampton offers a number of analogues for the act of filming and cinematic seeing that includes a series of appropriated 'lenses' ( a stone portal, a wooden silo) and a set of 'screens' a pool of water, curtains, a dusty window).","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":"/kopQdFMmBAZdtJSge5KHVyQ5a8x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Straits of Magellan: \"Drafts and Fragments\"","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hollis Frampton","original_name":"Hollis Frampton","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/94kbHx8NNf5WlZZlq6F94coSmyL.jpg","credit_id":"5a6d5b3dc3a368554401755f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7487914","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.628,"height":870,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bPtnjNbOEhPAaB5ylX94743DAJL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":546},{"aspect_ratio":0.628,"height":870,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cKrAq45Fn8QtvP9CGUv4QoLjDE3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":546},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8i327oFwberv2kKdxG43t4DhygN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1120},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kopQdFMmBAZdtJSge5KHVyQ5a8x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Millennium Film Workshop","release_date":"1974-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Carnegie Museum of Art","release_date":"1974-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
