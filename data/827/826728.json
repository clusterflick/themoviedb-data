Separated from their families, and fearing for their lives, they take bold action. But officials who run the detention center are intent on keeping these men and women silent, and keeping them locked up.  Filmed using the cameras attached to tablets installed inside the detention center cell-blocks, the film is a unique, real-time chronicle of a life in an immigration detention facility, and of a struggle for freedom and accountability.","popularity":0.3425,"poster_path":"/sY6specRQgRPLaM62rZcJApflof.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71551,"logo_path":"/hT2G2iuXXqY458TYen2T2qmjlS8.png","name":"Field of Vision","origin_country":"US"},{"id":155277,"logo_path":null,"name":"Type Investigations","origin_country":""},{"id":155278,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rayuela Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Facility","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Freed Wessler","original_name":"Seth Freed Wessler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60944dc024f2ce00290723da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387581,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patricia Benabe","original_name":"Patricia Benabe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60944dcdcee2f600297b34cf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1081390,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charlotte Cook","original_name":"Charlotte Cook","popularity":0.0952,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60944dd9037264003fd1e0fc","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1989644,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lindsey Cordero","original_name":"Lindsey Cordero","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60944de40d9f5a0029d1bb20","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Freed Wessler","original_name":"Seth Freed Wessler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60944dee1fb94f003f5cf6b3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1605877,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Angélica Negrón","original_name":"Angélica Negrón","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b53ee385005d00610ec45e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3344480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debbie Nathan","original_name":"Debbie Nathan","popularity":0.0699,"profile_path":"/mrx5z8T3VhRDOpiAwzN1mAyT0Ta.jpg","credit_id":"61b53f33ae26be001a503090","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3344481,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Carlos Andres Cuervo","original_name":"Carlos Andres Cuervo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b53f610372640041257e8f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3344482,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Damian Grey","original_name":"Damian Grey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b53f731f3319008d3b9c44","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2132378,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Filipe Messeder","original_name":"Filipe Messeder","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b53f9503726400635f78c7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14597700","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sY6specRQgRPLaM62rZcJApflof.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":691}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Full Frame Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2021-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Field of Vision - The Facility","key":"Vsy28UbZN2c","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2021-12-09T15:05:51.000Z","id":"61b53fdabd320900422ca6c8"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Facility (Trailer)","key":"ts0VsblyvMc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-12-02T12:01:20.000Z","id":"61b53ffb223e20001d5e4e33"}]}}}
