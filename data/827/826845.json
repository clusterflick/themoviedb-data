His initial difficulties in adjusting and the misunderstandings are sketched succinctly, but the meat of the film is the account of the boy's psychological blocks: his determination to go it alone, and his almost pathological inability to accept help and affection. In other words, not the usual anecdotal guff, but an intense and demanding study of the 'inner wounds' that afflict so many Chinese from the PRC.","popularity":0.1327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man from China","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Baker","original_name":"Marina Baker","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6094fcf06c449c003d038411","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara De Almeida","original_name":"Lara De Almeida","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6094fcfbc39266003af51845","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheng Yang Ying","original_name":"Sheng Yang Ying","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6094fd0527ff99003eea6f39","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhang Tielin","original_name":"Zhang Tielin","popularity":0.2336,"profile_path":"/v1H2fDwnSVixS4iZ3SvnhEQhJf0.jpg","credit_id":"6094fccffd4f80003f3316af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0434174","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
