The project is based on a collaboratively devised screenplay by Composer Hollie Harding and choreographer and director Josh Ben-Tovim, and evolved as a part of Hollie's residency with the London Symphony Orchestra on their Jerwood Plus Composer Scheme. The score investigates the potential of performed sound, foley and on-location field recording in combination - and uses the film as a stimulus for exploring the complex relationships between sound and sight, humans and ecology.","popularity":0.0626,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feral","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12073338","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
