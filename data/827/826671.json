Using onsite documentation, costumed reenactments, interviews with prominent curators and historians, architectural models, and computer graphics, Villa Visconti Borromeo Litta portrays centuries of Italian art and architectural history in terms of stylistic expression. The film also explores the social, familial, and political milieux—not least of which is the chronicle of Pirro I Visconti Borromeo, count of Brebbia, the creator of this place of art and delights, a romantic, a patron, and a sophisticated man of culture in Milan during the late sixteenth century. The villa’s wonders are many—its famous Nymphaeum, greenhouses, palaces, sculptures, frescoes, fountains, and water features among them.","popularity":0.1081,"poster_path":"/m99tb6Fd5JhUgaDZB0InSMD9muw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":102583,"logo_path":null,"name":"ROADMOVIE srl","origin_country":""},{"id":149319,"logo_path":"/mGKBzw8BssPlzRPLGULV6Wgewyi.png","name":"Moovie Productions","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":153873,"logo_path":null,"name":"Giardino22","origin_country":""},{"id":153874,"logo_path":null,"name":"TADV2studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Villa Visconti Borromeo Litta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358082,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francesco Vitali","original_name":"Francesco Vitali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60942196a6c1040057a0d9b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2068785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Botta","original_name":"Claudia Botta","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609421b80d9f5a0057880ebc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358082,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francesco Vitali","original_name":"Francesco Vitali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609421b187a27a0057cce9fc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358082,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francesco Vitali","original_name":"Francesco Vitali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609421d524f2ce0078ab2446","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081229,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alessandro Morandotti","original_name":"Alessandro Morandotti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609421c81c09fb006d09136b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/m99tb6Fd5JhUgaDZB0InSMD9muw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer - Villa Visconti Borromeo Litta","key":"CJQLtUYZbD4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-05-31T15:03:05.000Z","id":"609420dbcee2f6006d5206b7"}]}}}
