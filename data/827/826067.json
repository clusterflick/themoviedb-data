By integrating dance, theatre, rock music and film in short fast scenes this choreography exceeds the limits of dance. ANAPHASE. THE FILM is an effect of a creative collaboration between Ohad Naharin and Levi Zini, film’s director who managed to bring the experience of watching a live show to the cinema audience. The film isn’t a registration of a performance, but an electrifying translation of the choreography to the film medium.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/AmtFO4Rh3cSmI8hA0FxzXbX5KN9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anaphase","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Anaphase.
