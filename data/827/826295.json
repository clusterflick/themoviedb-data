As colorful as accomplished, these brave photojournalists made their mark by capturing some of the most iconic images from Tiananmen Square, to conflicts in Sarajevo, Iraq, Somalia and the Arab Spring uprising.  But the world doesn’t know it was these women behind the camera.  In the midst of unfolding chaos, the pictures they took for CNN both shocked and informed the world.  This feature documentary by director Heather O’Neill tells their remarkable story.","popularity":0.7559,"poster_path":"/oW0LcLkTAb68K0rLmziTCXlygqo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201003,"logo_path":null,"name":"Array Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The camerawomen who brought the frontlines to the headlines.","title":"No Ordinary Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christiane Amanpour","original_name":"Christiane Amanpour","popularity":0.3443,"profile_path":"/48JaEwyIxaGEi39JrEq6gORfXsX.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"647410d09ae613014668746e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4086099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Fleet","original_name":"Maria Fleet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"647410da5cd16e00a65694a4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4086100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Moth","original_name":"Margaret Moth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self (Archive Footage)","credit_id":"647410e9be2d4900dcdb480b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4086101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Rogers","original_name":"Mary Rogers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64741101dd731b2d762bb08c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4086102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynde Strand","original_name":"Cynde Strand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6474110bbe2d4900bf9e4d8b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1123454,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Heather O'Neill","original_name":"Heather O'Neill","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6092a8805f4b730040590a8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4086095,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stephen Santoyo","original_name":"Stephen Santoyo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64740fa5dd731b2d762baf9b","department":"Sound","job":"Dialogue Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4086092,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rich Brooks","original_name":"Rich Brooks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64740ea0cc277c00a745922b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neal Broffman","original_name":"Neal Broffman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64740ee2a199a6013328be4f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4086094,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Johnson","original_name":"Tom Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64740f41cc277c00dc4f470e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1123454,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Heather O'Neill","original_name":"Heather O'Neill","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64740ed19408ec00c28f3a8d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2925288,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Woody Woodhall","original_name":"Woody Woodhall","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64740fd7cc277c00dc4f4781","department":"Sound","job":"Supervising Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2925288,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Woody Woodhall","original_name":"Woody Woodhall","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64740fbfbe2d4900f9947260","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006691,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Kirst","original_name":"Patrick Kirst","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":"/9B0sK1b6BdHZVrflsYj6lkRbRcP.jpg","credit_id":"64740f8dcc277c00dc4f4749","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018812,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Morris Ruskin","original_name":"Morris Ruskin","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":"/sdElBijKPfR66vc6jf46VKKIURx.jpg","credit_id":"64740f05a199a60116c7cc22","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4086092,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rich Brooks","original_name":"Rich Brooks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64740eaba894d601195ef24f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4086093,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sharon J.
