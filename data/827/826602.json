As a diligent young filmmaker, he generously records his journey, reconstitutes his grandfather's route and binds to the descendants of his friends. In 2011, Lucas returns to continue his quest. This year, the country rises and the regime of Bashar al-Assad goes ahead with violent repressions. The film turns around and the pursuit towards a disappeared ancestor will turn into a race towards what is going to disappear.","popularity":0.0617,"poster_path":"/w2nTa7yXR8h6G1dFrax4MnMNoqi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ahlan wa sahlan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693021,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucas Vernier","original_name":"Lucas Vernier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6093e6c4a06efe002bc073e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13351050","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w2nTa7yXR8h6G1dFrax4MnMNoqi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
