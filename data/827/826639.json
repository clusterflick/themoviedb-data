Its namesake, Ellie, is a virtual avatar developed by the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies that is capable of interpreting human speech and gesture to reveal psychological distress. The film questions what it means to see, be seen, and be seen through in the face of disembodied artificial intelligence.","popularity":0.1982,"poster_path":"/vufC4dQ3oWubT8HPXr7lHIguvIF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153867,"logo_path":null,"name":"KADIST","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What do dogs and AIs have in common?","title":"Ellie's Eye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanya Aiko Abe","original_name":"Kanya Aiko Abe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"609403bb5f4b73002a9c09d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yina Kim","original_name":"Yina Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"609403c2c669ad00299a5e25","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Melamed","original_name":"Joe Melamed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"609403c8a06efe007a44b271","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081118,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mik Gaspay","original_name":"Mik Gaspay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609403dc2d1e40006d1aaef6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081120,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shona Mei Findlay","original_name":"Shona Mei Findlay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609403ef8dbc3300760e8ad1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081119,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Minhwi Lee","original_name":"Minhwi Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609403e57646fd0040376caa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2002337,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeamin Cha","original_name":"Jeamin Cha","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609403d35f4b730058e86639","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081121,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Morceau J.
