In the first part, \"Maria und die Welt\", Ute Aurand films Maria Lang in 1995, who moves to the countryside to take care of her mother. The second part, \"Familiengruft - ein Liebesgedicht an meine Mutter\" was produced by Maria Lang in 1981. It tells about what we most often keep quiet - prohibitions, barriers but also love. Twenty-two years later, Ute Aurand films Maria's daily care of her mother, now ninety-six years old: edited in 2006 by the two filmmakers, \"Der Schmetterling im Winter\", composes the last element of the triptych.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/85fzBJfnC5nD5WaNLceIj1QLRut.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ute Aurand Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Here, it is Very Nice at the Moment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Lang","original_name":"Maria Lang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60953b3d992fe6003b608aed","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1145419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ute Aurand","original_name":"Ute Aurand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5R1DsvP1zbaIGqI68FltbjSOUCG.jpg","credit_id":"60953b511b722c003cf92be5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Lang","original_name":"Maria Lang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60953b65025764003f47e34d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/85fzBJfnC5nD5WaNLceIj1QLRut.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
