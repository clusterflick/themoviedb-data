They should now have grown into young adults. What have they developed into? Have they managed to build up a future for themselves and their family? And what are their dreams for the future? He visits them with a film camera and sometimes as the only data their name and age. Especially the girl from Mozambique is hard to trace. After looking here and there, he finds a young woman, but is she the girl in the photograph? The boy from Peru is not doing so well. His Indian tribe is severely struck by TBC and hepatitis. In South Africa, Veeneman finds out that 'his' boy has become a lively lad who loves sport. The road movie documentary shows what their everyday lives look like today, the primary perspective being these people's inner strength and not so much the poverty that surrounds them.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":215191,"logo_path":null,"name":"First8","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2008-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That's Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4413782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sander Veeneman","original_name":"Sander Veeneman","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f037288634800ade5461f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4413783,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leonie van Hoëvell","original_name":"Leonie van Hoëvell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f037e0859b400c5387937","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank van den Engel","original_name":"Frank van den Engel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f038d5684630130a196ee","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4413782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sander Veeneman","original_name":"Sander Veeneman","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f039956846300ee145e17","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4413783,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leonie van Hoëvell","original_name":"Leonie van Hoëvell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f03a55684630130a19704","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4413782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sander Veeneman","original_name":"Sander Veeneman","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f03b36517d600af29eecc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":587608,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hugo Dijkstal","original_name":"Hugo Dijkstal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f03bf886348010be22942","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918157,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elja de Lange","original_name":"Elja de Lange","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f03ca6517d6012fab6c50","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4413782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sander Veeneman","original_name":"Sander Veeneman","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f03d73dc31300c4fb2565","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3167876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Klumper","original_name":"Bert Klumper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f03e3886348014d85edca","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
