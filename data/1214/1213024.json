Part poetry (found and original), part informational, a bit of science mixed with medical research, Limulus Love is all that and a whole lot of affection for the arthropod, whose blood is in high demand by we human animals. Early in the pandemic, filmmaker JuPong Lin went to the ocean in search of witnessing her beloved horseshoe crabs spawning under the full moon. On the final day of her trip, she thought she would leave disappointed. But then, as the luck of love would have it, one pair of horseshoe crabs called her to a hidden bay and showed themselves for a few minutes. A rare and thrilling experience with this amazing creature. Whether Limulus Love is your first encounter with the horseshoe crab or one of many, time is always made better with horseshoe crabs.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Limulus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4410254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"JuPong Lin","original_name":"JuPong Lin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656cb50a6517d6012faa2348","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Good Symptom","release_date":"2023-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
