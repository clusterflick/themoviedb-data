Sgt. Jacques Goulet  We’re joined with Goulet, who has apparently joined the French Foreign Legion between the 81 show and this one, holding a lengthy chinlock on the Baron, and dropping an elbow for two. Curt Hennig is working as a referee at this point, for whatever reason. Goulet turns the lengthy chinlock into a lengthier choke on the mat, and then TWISTS THE EARS and that just makes the Baron upset. Baron runs him into the turnbuckles to make the comeback, but Goulet takes him down and stomps him blatantly low to cut that off before going to a bearhug. Trongaard notes that we’re nearing 7 minutes, and my timer says 6:00 at this point, so Goulet literally went to a chinlock ONE MINUTE into the match. I’m not shocked. Goulet goes to the dreaded SCORPION HOLD, which is a claw to the back of the neck and I’m not even making that up.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AWA Christmas Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1982-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
