Since the arrival of the pro teams in the early 90s, the cycling scene on the island has exploded; loved for its unique blend of winter sun, smooth tarmac, and mountainous climbs - it’s now one of the most desirable two wheeled destinations on the planet.  Ex-pro cyclist, and local hero, Vincente Reynes takes us on an intimate tour across this island paradise. Showing us Mallorca’s vibrant culture and wondrous roads, he meets world tour super star Mavi García, Rapha Ambassador Miguel Indurain Jnr, and Olympic Gold Medallist Joan Llaneras. We discover Spain's oldest velodrome, the Tirador, take a peek inside the island's most famous bike workshop, and we learn the real story behind the famous Sa Calobra road.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gdQNjCu2NDUJQ8IdgdCzbVtn0qg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cycling Heartlands: Mallorca","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rbhsuToaxPHRmd2Yu0yWBLD0CC9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gdQNjCu2NDUJQ8IdgdCzbVtn0qg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cycling Heartlands: Mallorca","key":"_mOlIaxF88o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-03-22T00:01:09.000Z","id":"657243c8f288380139ad7a05"}]}}}
