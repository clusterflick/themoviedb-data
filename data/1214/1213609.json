Their presence as the first royal imperial band would make way for the composed music of Ethiopia's first national anthem, the popularization of brass instruments, and in later decades, a jazz revolution that sweeps the country before descending into the throes of the communist Derg regime. Told through first-hand accounts with Ethiopian jazz greats such as Alemayehu Eshete, Mulatu Astatke, Girum Mezmur, as well as Sammy Yirga and while following Vahé, the only performing Armenian singer / musician in Addis Ababa, TEZETA opens the musical door to a light of memories of a jazz club, a beloved teacher, and a golden musical era forgotten by many.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/rtDcnxjWfvCPuHhwnlK8qUsTE9J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ET","name":"Ethiopia"}],"release_date":"2024-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Amharic","iso_639_1":"am","name":""},{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TEZETA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4450,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mulatu
