Helping the Panther recapture his silver-screen luster are established directors Hawley Pratt (A FLY IN THE PINK), Gerry Chiniquy (SALMON PINK, PINK AYE), and Art Davis (PINK TUBA-DORE). Joining their ranks are veteran Warners helmer Robert McKimson (PINK DA VINCI) and artful behind-the-scenes DePatie-Freleng multi-tasker Art Leonardi (PINK PLASMA, PINK CAMPAIGN). Still in touch with the Temper of the Times, the Panther amusingly tackles a few then-trending 1970s topics such as environmentalism and animal-rights advocacy","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/AldTdGEUYUoWT5GhjbFRshKZSqk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pink Panther Cartoon Collection Vol. 4 (1971-1975)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1223,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AldTdGEUYUoWT5GhjbFRshKZSqk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":815}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Blu-ray","release_date":"2019-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
