But after a 15 year pro career on the road, he fancies a bit of a change. He’s heading to Belgium for a crash course in CX; watching it, riding it, & racing it.  With an all-star cast of ‘cross mentors - including Sven Nys, Shirin van Anrooij, and Puck Pieterse - Mitch will learn how to hop, run, and crash his way around a cyclocross course. His new-found skills will then be put to the test in perhaps the biggest challenge of Mitch’s career: an actual, real-life, cyclocross race.  Off the bike, Mitch will meet with fans and experts to discover the history of the sport and see why cyclocross has a reputation as the most fun hour of bike racing you can watch. Will Mitch fall in love with cyclocross or be left crying out for tarmac? One thing’s for sure: there will be mud.","popularity":0.2399,"poster_path":"/zPJFRQYomLiDlpQlgAL6BjC7mj0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""},{"id":204852,"logo_path":null,"name":"Play Sports Network","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There Will Be Mud","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4418604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitchell Docker","original_name":"Mitchell Docker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65723f906c849200eac6baa7","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8eRJHFC2kbaUdXi6EVc1tHQNNrg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zPJFRQYomLiDlpQlgAL6BjC7mj0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":241717,"name":"cyclocross"},{"id":333328,"name":"sport"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"There Will Be Mud","key":"uab3hQtnVOc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-01-30T09:39:23.000Z","id":"65723f704b0c6300ad708ec7"}]}}}
