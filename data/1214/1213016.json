Along the way he meets up with former Paralympic and World Champion Sarah Storey, track and road legend Rob Hayles and retired UCI president Brian Cookson. But the North West has more to it than just a velodrome. From humble cafe stops, legendary frame builders, Iconic bikes and Gold medal winners of the past and, hopefully the future. It's not just coincidence that has turned the north west into a cycling heartland.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3pZewhd9IEcS1BdTGxObcJ1ZvOx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cycling Heartlands: North West England","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dhFsMsH4xvEBV6IFjZJaD7B7x6d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3pZewhd9IEcS1BdTGxObcJ1ZvOx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cycling Heartlands: North West England","key":"wZx0_VjDn5Y","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-13T09:00:32.000Z","id":"657249a4f2883800ff40aa92"}]}}}
