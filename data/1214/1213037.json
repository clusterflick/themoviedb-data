To get Kenny alone, Dirk has found his profile on Grindr and is meeting up with him now under the guise of taking him out on a date. Dirk invites Kenny to join him for dinner in the private room of a fancy restaurant. As Dirk continues to maintain the charade of dating Kenny, he discovers that his target isn’t anything like the cold, unfeeling monster that he was led to expect. He’s shy, awkward, and seems to be a truly kind person, despite what he does for a living. Dirk relates to Kenny’s life story immensely and begins to feel a legitimate spark between them. Suddenly, he has to decide between carrying out his mission and pursuing a relationship with the man he’s been ordered to kill. Little does Dirk know that Kenny has secrets of his own– and he might just get Dirk’s heart to melt.","popularity":0.0753,"poster_path":"/cxgLBT59Zh62yhgepyewsuMy21Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Getting Hit On","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4410266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Brady","original_name":"Patrick Brady","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"656cb7ab4a4bf600e9efdd69","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4410267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Christian","original_name":"Matt Christian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"656cb7b4e38bd8011a6cc9e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2322828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Adams","original_name":"Nicholas Adams","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/fdtql9m2q8Sr1bU5DQDGErPYrao.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"656cb7d00859b400c53716ba","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2931205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lilton Stewart III","original_name":"Lilton Stewart III","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/8m57SNjMOZu21gGwlYsz0O7aPEu.jpg","credit_id":"656cb77b88055101000e1e36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29543680","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cxgLBT59Zh62yhgepyewsuMy21Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Independent Short Awards","release_date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
