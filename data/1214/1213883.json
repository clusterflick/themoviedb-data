As memories resurface, we witness their tumultuous childhood marked by countless encounters with the law. Unraveling in flashbacks, we see the McGuire siblings navigating a world of petty crimes and rebellion, laughing off the consequences that seemed inevitable.  However, the story takes an unexpected turn when a pandemic-induced lockdown thrusts them into a whirlwind of desperation and fear. On a desolate country road, they encounter Ian Hamilton, a figure from their past who only adds to the tension.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
