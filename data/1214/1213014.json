But to even get to the start line, James Lowsley-Williams & Mark Beaumont need to scale the world's highest active volcano, Ojos del Salado with their bikes strapped to their backs. To make the start line they must acclimatise to the crushing altitude and the barren landscape before their attempt begins. Mark and James have nailed several epic rides in the past, but this latest attempt moves them into a different league, with extreme altitude and barren inhospitable landscapes challenging them before they can even begin.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/io0wvYsTRGnSpaX5HiVR8ur2GHg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chile: The Longest Descent - Part 1 - The Highest Volcano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13979248","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rQucyEvBSDuIxVBAwY1afu4o1qw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/io0wvYsTRGnSpaX5HiVR8ur2GHg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Chile: The Longest Descent Pt.1: The Highest Volcano","key":"1xGb1yxLcbE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-02-05T10:00:01.000Z","id":"65724c366c849200c9824772"}]}}}
