Dijkstra wants to create a large nature reserve where people no longer have any influence: an area where the river can run its course and wolves can be set free. The fanatical landscape architect however does not bear in mind the needs of the local people. His younger colleague David is eventually sent to Poland to get things organised. Taming the Floods is a mixture of documentary and feature in which all the scenes are borrowed from situations which really happen or have happened. Alongside actors, roles are played by the local people, including farmers and a priest.","popularity":0.0814,"poster_path":"/zgB45MOw8mUhalseStwkxVpCi6z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215210,"logo_path":null,"name":"drsFILM","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1999-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taming the Floods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Decleir","original_name":"Jan Decleir","popularity":0.2889,"profile_path":"/wgCWRtfO4HROS1o2QltEGh9DLGG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"656f262e6517d600cc4339ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1486683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Rigter","original_name":"Frank Rigter","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/wb7sNnUjzBRKz3R0VMyBiTqpoTM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"656f26376517d6012fab7c36","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrzej Żarnecki","original_name":"Andrzej Żarnecki","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/hhmQhUrjSSLFgs7ybeEfTZS1gV0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"656f263f88055100e3715d97","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lech Dyblik","original_name":"Lech Dyblik","popularity":0.1421,"profile_path":"/1tOJ0Q0Qg3Va7shQsPAiOOylEqv.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"67e53d65e8a1910e6510b0ff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karolina Wajda","original_name":"Karolina Wajda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"656f264788055100c682d40a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4413973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Furmaga","original_name":"Joanna Furmaga","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"656f264f0859b400e29ea805","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Jurewicz","original_name":"Jan Jurewicz","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/v6vurlh0AscAxRdri1kbqsWycT3.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"67e53da9421eb8c331ba4af2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5331285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ks.
