After a long drive from the city Joe and veteran art handler Arnold arrive at Mrs. Smith's impressive suburban mansion. The two unload their truck and carry a boxed artwork up to the door. Joe notices a label on the box and realizes it is an artwork by one of his favorite artists, Fred Rawlings. Joe can hardly contain his excitement, but Arnold quickly shuts him down. Joe and Arnold carefully unpack the artwork exposing a mesmerizing glimmering roped surface. As Arnold climbs the ladder to hang the piece the roped sculpture unravels itself and is revealed to be a diamond encrusted noose. Mrs. Smith is visibly aroused by the noose and has an intimate \"moment\" with the artwork. Joe is skeptical, but gets back in the truck and they pull off. He has no clue where they are headed and figures the day can't get any stranger. Wrong. Welcome to the art world Joe.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hangtime","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3016573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chester Vincent Toye","original_name":"Chester Vincent Toye","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656e1480880551011d1e6d40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27956671","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
