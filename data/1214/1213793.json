It's one of cycling's most prestigious achievements and one of it's toughest physical challenges. In 1972, Eddy Merckx, arguably the greatest cyclist of all time set a benchmark of 49.431km, using a bike and technology now considered rudimentary. Merckx's record stood for 12 years. Can Oliver Bridgewood, an amateur cyclist and GCN presenter with access to the aerodynamic technology and modern equipment beat his time? He embarks on a punishing 3 months of training set by some of the world’s most experienced high-performance coaches and prepares for what will be the hardest hour of his life.","popularity":0.0521,"poster_path":"/57GYEDpZv88HgsEIRbRynoQPeJh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hour Of Power -  Cycling’s Ultimate Test","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j4gHAuKBy1vyr4CNgWdxd7uvHei.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/57GYEDpZv88HgsEIRbRynoQPeJh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Hour Of Power - Cycling’s Ultimate Test","key":"cZaXJio5AtY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-02-18T10:00:19.000Z","id":"65724b07172d7f00c96010c5"}]}}}
