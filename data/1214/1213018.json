Writer, director, producer, Patrick Bazin, hits a sweet spot between humor and terror, delivering a hyper-stylized blow to the tyranny of blandness, mass-produced plastics, conformity, and uniformity. A First Attempt at Aesthetic Resistance leaves a righteous desire-for-beauty afterglow millions of miles long.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A First Attempt at Aesthetic Resistance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3970613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Bazin","original_name":"Patrick Bazin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656cb4128eda8700c63e9386","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Good Symptom","release_date":"2023-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
