Here, the themes of food and sexuality are negotiated;  more specifically, it's about French \"haute cuisine,\" which is brought into a sexually charged  context during the film. The boundaries between the art of cooking, food consumption and sex  become blurred in FOOD LOVE; the food that the protagonist creates is consumed in a multiple  sense and serves physical gratification in an ambiguous sense. In the order of a French menu,  sexual acts are performed with and on the dishes. After the climax, however, a surprise awaits:  it is an inconspicuous fast-food burger that is finally eaten by the protagonist.","popularity":0.5342,"poster_path":"/9Ceknjd3zfYz7gNyCotJ2YErTTN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2023-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Food Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4411811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Graf","original_name":"Martin Graf","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Unknown","credit_id":"656de81d05a53300e3baa498","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4415865,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rebecca Erbacher","original_name":"Rebecca Erbacher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657075ca79a1c300ab3443c9","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4415866,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"David Jagella","original_name":"David Jagella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657075d641ad8d06e2ecc603","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4415863,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Maximilian Mayr","original_name":"Maximilian Mayr","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657075affad8e900adbc58a4","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4415864,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Uli Graf","original_name":"Uli Graf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657075bbe1faed00fec51708","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4411815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximilian Hase","original_name":"Maximilian Hase","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656de62b88055100aeea25aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4411813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magdalena Mayr","original_name":"Magdalena Mayr","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656de6206517d600edb2863d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4411916,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maximilian Hase","original_name":"Maximilian Hase","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656de86505a53300e3baa4af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4411914,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Magdalena Mayr","original_name":"Magdalena Mayr","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656de8315684630130a1007b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4411915,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maximilian Hase","original_name":"Maximilian Hase","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656de85751f99a00c657c2f3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/icQ7dSX0ILM7AsoVX6C8sfqfRLi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Ceknjd3zfYz7gNyCotJ2YErTTN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156804,"name":"menu"},{"id":237557,"name":"slow food"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":267275,"name":"haute cuisine"},{"id":322268,"name":"comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"PFFB","release_date":"2023-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
