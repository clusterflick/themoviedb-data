When her mother dies unexpectedly, she returns to her native Limburg village for the funeral. She decides to move into her mother's studio on the edge of the Galgenven and make pictures in the vein of her mother's paintings of the village and its inhabitants and the unique nature surrounding it. While Anna thus tries to regain her identity, it turns out that part of that nature will have to yield to project developers' plans. A fierce battle flares up between Anna and large landowner Hyacint de Beaumont. The village, where many people depend on him, is divided. When Anna finally seems to be all alone, she receives help from unexpected quarters. This has dramatic consequences.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/zgB45MOw8mUhalseStwkxVpCi6z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215210,"logo_path":null,"name":"drsFILM","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2009-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Het
