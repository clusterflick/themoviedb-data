With just old bike parts and the tools available, UK framebuilders extraordinaire Paul Burford and Ted James team up with ex pro Alex Paton and Crit racer Alec Briggs to conjure up new bikes from old.  Under the watchful eye of judges Si Richardson and expert Andrew Denham, as the action unfolds, everything that can go wrong, does go wrong - from wonky wheels, to faulty frames and crazy cranks! This all culminates in a day of wacky races but will either of the bikes be roadworthy? And will they look the part? Who will be crowned the winner?","popularity":0.0712,"poster_path":"/x2K6QOJMCuyHMnCRBrkWwrCPT2E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Junk Bike Battle: Random Tandems","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4200170,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Simon Richardson","original_name":"Simon Richardson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/l9mn6oCzkoUelX4NWseGxF02X31.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65723cd06c8492014d161701","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4418595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Paton","original_name":"Alex Paton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sxL8t4XntVgLKX3cRvMVqI7tP49.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65723d2757d37800acc63123","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28491903","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Wjx3pZ6bw4OimQA0BxwjK0p0Zs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x2K6QOJMCuyHMnCRBrkWwrCPT2E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Junk Bike Battle: Random Tandems","key":"EsTr1Zs_QEw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-07-07T16:15:28.000Z","id":"65723cbef2883800c5abacf6"}]}}}
