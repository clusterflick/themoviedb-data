Fairy-tale spoofs (PINK PIPER, CAT AND THE BEANSTALK) make a modest comeback, but much more impressive are brand-new wrinkles on familiar Panther themes like sleep deprivation (Art Davis's PINK TRUMPET), wars against a pesky fly (turning positively apocalyptic in Sid Marcus's PINK S.W.A.T.) and journeys through surreality (SHERLOCK PINK, Robert McKimson's last and probably best \"Panther\" pic).","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/pkHNmrbmGD2UbDFN9jHSLiYFXJ8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pink Panther Cartoon Collection Vol. 5 (1976-1978)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":806,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pkHNmrbmGD2UbDFN9jHSLiYFXJ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":538}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Blu-ray","release_date":"2019-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
