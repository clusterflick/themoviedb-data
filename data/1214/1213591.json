Not the steepest, or the hardest, but when the Tour de France hits Alpe d’Huez, drama is guaranteed. It’s featured more than thirty times and is eagerly awaited by hordes of fans lining the route. Crowds are estimated to  have swelled to over a million and on one of the sport’s most recognisable bends all of Holland seems to camp out; the iconic Dutch Corner.  Conor is joined by ex-pro Fränk Schleck who won on the mountain in 2006. His victory cemented his place at cycling’s top table, and Fränk’s name is now immortalised on hairpin eighteen, alongside double stage winner, Hennie Kuiper, who also shares his memories of the mythical mountain.","popularity":0.2499,"poster_path":"/j6fxPYRLQQp38AfPd3eqbeMvrys.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205614,"logo_path":null,"name":"GCN+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alpe d’Huez","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4418540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conor Dunne","original_name":"Conor Dunne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65723768f28838011c43d33d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2631623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fränk Schleck","original_name":"Fränk Schleck","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"657237a557d37800fee8478e","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wQeHKBFsARdfZ95ntOsWvHzWeIj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j6fxPYRLQQp38AfPd3eqbeMvrys.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":180491,"name":"cycling"},{"id":209282,"name":"french alps"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Alpe d’Huez","key":"5wSiw1tnCF8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-12-04T17:03:05.000Z","id":"657235ebb6cff100c5bc9711"}]}}}
