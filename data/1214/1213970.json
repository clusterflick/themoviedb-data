The mentioned filmmaker, as ever,  surrenders himself once again in the depths of the forest with his camera, adding a new film to his life and beliefs. For him, cinema and the life he reaches through cinema touch upon all the emotions and thoughts that can be questioned in the world where he resides and is tested by its absence. The nature he reaches thanks to this journey is something presented to him from nothingness. Unable to decide what to do with this nothingness, the filmmaker, ultimately makes a film that he can present to people with the nature bestowed upon him. The resulting film essentially belongs to a day of the man who roams in the forest and points his camera at the trees.","popularity":0.0553,"poster_path":"/c1dy0v7fZOwA9ic4J0o1Kyon9eC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bestowal","title":"Bestowal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3582209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enes Serenli","original_name":"Enes Serenli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Actor","credit_id":"656f3eca886348012c8a8350","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3582209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enes Serenli","original_name":"Enes Serenli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f3eed88055100c682dfbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4414121,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mert Mustafa Babacan","original_name":"Mert Mustafa Babacan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f3eff6517d600edb33cdd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759669,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ege Malkoç","original_name":"Ege Malkoç","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f3f0d88055100c682dfce","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3957576,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emre Karagöz","original_name":"Emre Karagöz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f3f1f88634800ade56361","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c1dy0v7fZOwA9ic4J0o1Kyon9eC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"13+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
