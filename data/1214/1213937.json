Heartsick from suffering, Orpheus descends into the Underworld to bring his beloved Eurydice who has just died from a snake bite back. The magnificent music played by Orpheus convinces Hades, the god of the Underworld, to free Eurydice, but on one condition : on his way back to Earth, Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice. On finally arriving at the gates of the Underworld, already catching glimpses of trees and bushes, Orpheus looks back. Eurydice disappears forever into darkness.","popularity":0.1816,"poster_path":"/8KgTEnVoxfJGTS5Z5pmloeIBZAh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76129,"logo_path":"/wadqq2xlU1fWkRT2BSOb2VDyDVZ.png","name":"Tempesta","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":33279,"logo_path":"/4cWgpF6cLunSrG4fSdBPT2gF8ie.png","name":"Ad Vitam Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":113179,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amka Films Productions","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cin√©ma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Thread","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yle Vianello","original_name":"Yile Vianello","popularity":0.2681,"profile_path":"/oqmoWSIlF2eikiGv42rmqEVNi6a.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"656f293a88055100e3715f13","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Rohrwacher","original_name":"Alice Rohrwacher","popularity":0.3244,"profile_path":"/l1vF7WGjF9si1wpRu8ABysQgvfJ.jpg","credit_id":"656f294b88055101000fbf3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1502,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8KgTEnVoxfJGTS5Z5pmloeIBZAh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
