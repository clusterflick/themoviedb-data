The production was an attempt to pivot Toei's output from yakuza films and Toei Porn towards \"global issues\" and \"whatever makes money\", as stated by then-Toei president Shigeru Okada.  Theatrical proceeds were to be shared as relief funds through the Japanese Red Cross, though the box office returns are unknown.  Footage shot for the documentary by Yoshimitsu Banno would later be reused in the 1974 Toho production Prophecies of Nostradamus.","popularity":0.2006,"poster_path":"/hyB4dmgX9U4KGs6lWMcUWorZdwW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nirasawa Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1973-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cruel Famine Continent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Zankoku Kiga Tairiku","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235715,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yoshimitsu Banno","original_name":"坂野義光","popularity":0.3418,"profile_path":"/hVdTwOsJNUEtzSU88qi878qZGr7.jpg","credit_id":"656e662888634800ade4c131","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4412958,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Atsuya Shioda","original_name":"Atsuya Shioda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656e67a156846300cdb9b969","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akira Ide","original_name":"Akira Ide","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656e66490859b4011c2357cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2051930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masaharu Ito","original_name":"Masaharu Ito","popularity":0.0699,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656e678c88634800ade4c192","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12397428","wikidata_id":"Q120334952","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hyB4dmgX9U4KGs6lWMcUWorZdwW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":522}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":180999,"name":"drought"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1973-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
