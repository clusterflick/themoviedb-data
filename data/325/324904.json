It tells the story of a man (played by Dario Merlini) who forgets his memories by drinking water from a fountain at the border between Galicia and Portugal. Thus begins a journey that will take him to iconic sites - Couto Mixto, Antela, Ourense-, to engage with different stories and special situations, before finding his way towards his real identity.","popularity":0.3021,"poster_path":"/rP6CiPbhtzrSxc6D9xyXX46H7Pp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46396,"logo_path":null,"name":"Noveolas Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Galician","iso_639_1":"gl","name":"Galego"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9 Waves","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"9 olas","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"9 onde","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dario Merlini","original_name":"Dario Merlini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Joao, Manolo, Manu","credit_id":"54db825f925141618c001e5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Tasende","original_name":"María Tasende","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/5QNXc9maPkuYEeQQksuMnLdBood.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"María","credit_id":"54db83079251416191002014","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Risco","original_name":"Isabel Risco","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54db8315925141619e001e2a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1426016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Manzano","original_name":"Miguel Manzano","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/cJkXGe5QlXhCQVSd5NMZU172eGz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Iván","credit_id":"54db8331c3a368122d001e59","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426046,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Os Forasteiros","original_name":"Os Forasteiros","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54db9416925141618f0020cd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1426039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simone Saibene","original_name":"Simone Saibene","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54db9312925141618c00202b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426041,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lucía C.
