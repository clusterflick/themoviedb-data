Driven by an obsessed sense of mission, Dub uses his own investigation skills to uncover the truth in this and other recent officer-involved shootings in his community, while tackling larger questions about the changing face of peace officers nationwide.","popularity":0.1193,"poster_path":"/u794B3BXPb5ekWB4TkdhAtp478W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sor√∏ Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-16","revenue":26632,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We've Crossed The Line","title":"Peace Officer","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1424393,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Scott Christopherson","original_name":"Scott Christopherson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54d69a88925141758c002bd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brad Barber","original_name":"Brad Barber","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54d69a7cc3a3683b99002ca0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4079142","wikidata_id":"Q19824825","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dlfVWeuqUttNl8oK69XcAxiQVqU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1358,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u794B3BXPb5ekWB4TkdhAtp478W.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":905},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1358,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xeAxyyegxm2WFaBaIK3WKAzl4Wp.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":905},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1358,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7lpOdfhc2C20CqGEghYPk43drAr.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":905},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/awPRwyzWZE3o2GMoUjvISonREfS.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t3Csnlfcv2nScf1n8Af8ddRlxBy.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South by Southwest Film Festival","release_date":"2015-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer","key":"XPYBxenREUs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2015-08-11T16:58:24.000Z","id":"6348503e7a97ab007a4c0e13"}]}}}
