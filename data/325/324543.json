Filmed 12 years apart, the 1958 concert features Dizzy working eloquently within the small combo structure of a quintet including such influential musicians as sax player Sonny Stitt and bassist Ray Brown. The second show focuses on a completely different side of Dizzy, fronting the legendary Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland Big Band. With a 16-piece big band to conduct, including two drummers, his Latin influences are revealed on \"Con Alma\" and \"Manteca.\"","popularity":0.1256,"poster_path":"/hqZufLQqTUajdShm1NUuqKq84TB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dizzy Gillespie Live in Belgium 1958 & Live in Denmark 1970","title":"Jazz Icons: Dizzy Gillespie Live in '58 & '70","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dizzy Gillespie","original_name":"Dizzy Gillespie","popularity":0.1603,"profile_path":"/qc9mu8xBcPg32W3Rz09vdSJLBDE.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57404fcfc3a3680749001abd","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hqZufLQqTUajdShm1NUuqKq84TB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
