The festival, widely condemned by the media as three days of drugs, violence and sex, became the scapegoat for both the left and the right to further political agendas. Emotional interviews with festival organizers and musicians illustrate how their involvement with the festival changed the courses of their lives as they dealt with backlash from both conservative Chileans and outraged government forces. Piedra Roja. laced with period music, was produced and filmed by one of the festival organizers.","popularity":0.0676,"poster_path":"/g9sfHxru0bPEPFtJBt4k4Tk9QFU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Piedra Roja","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3107053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Mutis","original_name":"Mario Mutis","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67f44180ddf9194387d9a495","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5356147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Fritz","original_name":"Gary Fritz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f440d4ddf9194387d9a40b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5356150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Fritz","original_name":"Ann Fritz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f440f8eddec28b03adb6a5","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g9sfHxru0bPEPFtJBt4k4Tk9QFU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
