After the regime fell from power in 2001, a fledgling free press emerged and a photography revolution was born. Now, as foreign troops and media withdraw, Afghanistan is left to stand on its own and so are its journalists. Set in a modern Afghanistan bursting with color and character, FRAME BY FRAME follows four Afghan photojournalists navigating a dangerous media landscape as they reframe Afghanistan for the world, and for themselves. Through cinema vérité, powerful photojournalism, and never-before-seen footage shot in secret during the Taliban regime, the film connects an audience with four humans in the pursuit of the truth.","popularity":0.1134,"poster_path":"/3GLoSGEnGPkCCtyqBlgUqeRWhS7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26693,"logo_path":null,"name":"CoPilot Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":48383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Reel","origin_country":"US"},{"id":48384,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rake Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Reframing a nation.","title":"Frame by Frame","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1875128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massoud Hossaini","original_name":"Massoud Hossaini","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"599d7ec59251411f0c01d386","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1875130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wakil Kohsar","original_name":"Wakil Kohsar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"599d7ecc9251411f0c01d394","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1875132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Najibullah Mosafer","original_name":"Najibullah Mosafer","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"599d7ed7c3a368282c01b815","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1875133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farzana Wahidy","original_name":"Farzana Wahidy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"599d7ee2c3a368284801ede7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandria Bombach","original_name":"Alexandria Bombach","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54d688cf9251416ba100290c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1424355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mo Scarpelli","original_name":"Mo Scarpelli","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/hCdeTvJ73GNWdF6bkdqRFXPeG29.jpg","credit_id":"54d688da9251416b9f002a8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15894,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Myers","original_name":"Tom Myers","popularity":0.3028,"profile_path":"/igQ5idVJbKHFHaUPvIyR40qiZyF.jpg","credit_id":"66d3b182048e1714e9ae123e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15894,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Myers","original_name":"Tom Myers","popularity":0.3028,"profile_path":"/igQ5idVJbKHFHaUPvIyR40qiZyF.jpg","credit_id":"66d3b19d2a757e104878d775","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4335808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3GLoSGEnGPkCCtyqBlgUqeRWhS7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6GOGT0lYFf41f3hxL8WA6hEky4o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"NPO 2","release_date":"2017-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
