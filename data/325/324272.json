Instead of money the teenagers have a stash of grass waiting for a buyer. Food? Nothing wrong with the leftovers from other people’s plates. Tent? Why bother when you can sleep under the stars. Sleep? No way: the party goes on all night. V is a pretty girl who knows how to use her charms to the best advantage. Betty, more reserved and shy, never quite knows what to do with her hands, how to hold a cigarette, what to say to the boys they meet. But the tables are turned when the pair go their separate ways after an argument.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/giTdxlSK9g0pv2mtnm3NmTvXIXj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2015-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Entry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"One Day of Betty","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yvonne Kerékgyártó","original_name":"Yvonne Kerékgyártó","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54d689a19251417160002d53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3572756","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/giTdxlSK9g0pv2mtnm3NmTvXIXj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":840}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
