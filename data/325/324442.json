Americans couldn't help but believe in miracles that night, and when the members of Team USA won the gold medal two days later, they became a team for the ages. This film explores the \"Miracle on Ice\" through the Soviet lens. While focused on the game itself, the journey of the stunned Soviet team didn't begin -- or end -- in Lake Placid.","popularity":0.7951,"poster_path":"/4q5ARYXT6zfo5rUShP7eLXH7uXO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Of Miracles and Men","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Lake Placid 1980: Miracle on Ice","type":"Alt.
