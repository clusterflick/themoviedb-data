From playing the USO circuit throughout Asia to headlining in Las Vegas and recording 7 albums for Columbia records, Tomi’s career culminates in a 1964 performance at The Grand Ole Opry where she followed Johnny Cash and received the only standing ovation of the night. Forty years later, Tomi and her husband set out on a journey through Japan and across the United States to fulﬁll a dream of performing at The Opry one more time. Made in Japan is a funny yet poignant multi-cultural journey through music, marriage, and the impact of the corporate world on the dreams of one woman.","popularity":0.6934,"poster_path":"/f8L81rhv2XOt4rNahJZkIaFCIXr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From Nagoya to Nashville... one more time","title":"Made in Japan","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elijah Wood","original_name":"Elijah Wood","popularity":3.362,"profile_path":"/7UKRbJBNG7mxBl2QQc5XsAh6F8B.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"54d69556c3a3683b9200333c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1424386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomi Fujiyama","original_name":"Tomi Fujiyama","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54d695619251417160002f7e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1114972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Bishop","original_name":"Josh Bishop","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54d69546c3a3683ba0003219","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elijah Wood","original_name":"Elijah Wood","popularity":3.362,"profile_path":"/7UKRbJBNG7mxBl2QQc5XsAh6F8B.jpg","credit_id":"67afce6947dbfba4646c345c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3349380","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/f8L81rhv2XOt4rNahJZkIaFCIXr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qsCL8kwSgRF5Lq6y48wNd8QwCJt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kdPuwYwlonuHtrFVMXJP1rjvc6h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":727,"name":"country music"},{"id":12369,"name":"tokyo, japan"},{"id":14570,"name":"las vegas"},{"id":164734,"name":"nashville, tennessee"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
