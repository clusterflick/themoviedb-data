Andy wants to plant a new garden with the help of his dog. Unfortunately, everything goes wrong for both of them. Andy finds that the ground is hard as rocks and he can't dig; he has to use a drill. The dog chases a worm and gets stuck in a rake. The worm whacks him and leads him on a merry chase through a garden hose, turning it into a snake which blasts the poor dog in the face with water. Meanwhile, Andy's seeds are vacuumed up by a rooster, which he attacks with a sickle. The rooster lands on the dog. The battle rages with everything in a heap. The garden is ruined... or is it? The super-grow fertilizer is working wonders.","popularity":0.1366,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andy Panda's Victory Garden","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernice Hansen","original_name":"Bernice Hansen","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/1T1q0UvWl1xO3pmUbUdDIXz6gvZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Andy Panda (voice)","credit_id":"54d5350992514172e300000b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Lovy","original_name":"Alex Lovy","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/txGj5oXMl7rVvHwDQsOeichoFIH.jpg","credit_id":"54d534fd9251416b9f00003f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0146433","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
