When the Bishop, despite objections from many within his faith, decided to take his family’s musical ministry outside the church, he unexpectedly connected with the oddest of allies – a jaded, atheistic rock critic, who also happened to be a gospel historian. To Michael Corcoran, the Jones Family Singers represent a living link to a style of gospel he thought had disappeared. These most unlikely of friends bonded through perhaps their one shared trait -- a deeply rooted rebelliousness.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jones Family Will Make a Way","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424430,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan Berg","original_name":"Alan Berg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54d6aabfc3a3683b920038cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4074348","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
