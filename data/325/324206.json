From that point on nobody could hold him back, and the much loved cranky character went on to be the most prolific of Walt's \"fabulous five.\" Now for the first time, you can enjoy the Donald in all of his solo starring shorts from \"Donald And Pluto\" in 1936 to \"Chef Donald\" in 1941. This volume also includes a loving tribute to the man who achieved immortality by inventing the voice of Donald Duck -- and performing as his alter ego for 50 years -- Clarence \"Ducky\" Nash. Featuring exclusive introductions by film historian Leonard Maltin, this is a timeless collection from generations past for generations to come.","popularity":0.2895,"poster_path":"/1JQzALMLdQXB1ZbqyzDUajSQM8w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":275,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"1934 - 1941","title":"Walt Disney Treasures - The Chronological Donald, Volume One","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Walt Disney Kostbarkeiten - Donald im Wandel der Zeit Volume 1","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Walt Disney Kostbarkeiten: Donald - Im Wandel der Zeit - 1934-1941","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Walt Disney Treasures  - Semplicemente Paperino","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1712059","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/18PauBnCn9uwyHZh8wiaiPzyAeE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ljnPPXcjtRMwvgleBr8t1LCZc0g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1JQzALMLdQXB1ZbqyzDUajSQM8w.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tHBmgFsWx1PkZL5hx1SFC9XwtBX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/c62cNcKhPGmHUvfZqiY90qWRY9K.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1068,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/yTHaC735AmcF1yVxmSWp2HHBwUD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":746},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1068,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/rtkkJnBgSzIHtkWy1JyuOuvqnyg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":749},{"aspect_ratio":0.692,"height":1068,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/fNJmz1B5CYTnKmF5FqFNqB2DBWx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":739}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
