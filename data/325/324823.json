He spends his days drawing marvellous works with his crayons, depicting human and fantastic beings, fauna, flora, his own inner visions, mystical themes and sex, with a trace of impressive primitivism and beauty. The film registers his daily life.","popularity":0.1887,"poster_path":"/vsbmSCexD7mS0PWwHqsXMTFBLi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34630,"logo_path":"/lKKe99vus0EbdBoMunQMm8olFVA.png","name":"República Pureza Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2006-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moacir Art Brut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moacir","original_name":"Moacir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54db264e92514161a10014dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domingos Soares de Farias","original_name":"Domingos Soares de Farias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54db263ec3a368122a0014cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siron Franco","original_name":"Siron Franco","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54db2646c3a368122d001440","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodrigo Fonseca","original_name":"Rodrigo Fonseca","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/4D54yKMf3RBTNVfU2b8ytRwWQm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e63967655c92600155d18c3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10038,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Walter Carvalho","original_name":"Walter Carvalho","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/y7FAwZ5YBKvCjkNRMTMIksaG97r.jpg","credit_id":"54db265b925141619e00144e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0797026","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rUpNeZoveaK25DeQ59Yh0InS5Q9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1102,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/vsbmSCexD7mS0PWwHqsXMTFBLi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":735}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
