Looking to fulfill a life-long dream of having a place in the country, he went out on a limb and purchased the enchanting but dilapidated structure. Adrien took charge of an elaborate restoration of the property spanning seven years, transforming it into a magical place to share with family and friends. Teaming up with filmmaker Kevin Ford, Adrien created a personal cinematic record of the journey. Stone Barn Castle is a portrayal of the pursuit of dreams and the distance one must travel to achieve them.","popularity":0.445,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Stone Barn Castle is a portrayal of the pursuit of dreams and the distance one must travel to achieve them.","title":"Stone Barn Castle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrien Brody","original_name":"Adrien Brody","popularity":3.6676,"profile_path":"/id5GuTduKt3yCwb7BrVLuWKqaSq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"634d7a5a389da10081cdd6eb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrien Brody","original_name":"Adrien Brody","popularity":3.6676,"profile_path":"/id5GuTduKt3yCwb7BrVLuWKqaSq.jpg","credit_id":"54d6a3cc9251415f9c002dfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Ford","original_name":"Kevin Ford","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/cwaRXJhK35icPe5MXoYX43olFeD.jpg","credit_id":"54d6a3ec9251415f9c002e0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrien Brody","original_name":"Adrien Brody","popularity":3.6676,"profile_path":"/id5GuTduKt3yCwb7BrVLuWKqaSq.jpg","credit_id":"634d7aa89e458600811b2815","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Ford","original_name":"Kevin Ford","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/cwaRXJhK35icPe5MXoYX43olFeD.jpg","credit_id":"634d7ae389f7490082e1eb96","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Ford","original_name":"Kevin Ford","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/cwaRXJhK35icPe5MXoYX43olFeD.jpg","credit_id":"634d7af112eb890082c54aba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Frusciante","original_name":"John Frusciante","popularity":0.2854,"profile_path":"/tuia85HcQuzDUwk5f2zfk7odXIw.jpg","credit_id":"5b69590cc3a368189d0e3e81","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4512710","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SXSW Festival","release_date":"2015-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
