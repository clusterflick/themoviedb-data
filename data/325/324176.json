His new order leads the strict and incorruptible record watcher to the Finnish island of Föglö. There is said to be a boy there who can make a stone jump 52 times on the water. Marvin does not have a great desire for the arduous journey, and when the twelve-year-old Elias barely fails in his attempt to set a record, he wants to leave immediately. However, Marvin did not count on the shrewd islanders who want to give the life-threatening boy a second chance - especially Elias' aunt Fanny.","popularity":0.2277,"poster_path":"/urEfKgArnuRIKZdyLh9AVRU6P8B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Rekordbeobachter","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Record: Oltre l'impossibile","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Milberg","original_name":"Axel Milberg","popularity":0.256,"profile_path":"/eK1Kkda8rOZMgo5BYBUVeYenOwj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marvin Feldmann","credit_id":"54d611cdc3a3683b92002333","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann-Kathrin Kramer","original_name":"Ann-Kathrin Kramer","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/kcZNmkiD3J7CP792iNvelRE33av.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fanny Hilleröd","credit_id":"54d611e492514171600021f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1150979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabine Vitua","original_name":"Sabine Vitua","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/9AssDcB3VCw7Khesw8dh6UnHMXg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Loni Seiler","credit_id":"5553d2abc3a368208a0002f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludwig Skuras","original_name":"Ludwig Skuras","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Elias Hilleröd","credit_id":"5ab2d417c3a3681cba010a65","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greta Galisch de Palma","original_name":"Greta Galisch de Palma","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Frieda Hilleröd","credit_id":"5ab2d4289251411651010ecf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":999636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kari Hevossaari","original_name":"Kari Hevossaari","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Erik Hilleröd","credit_id":"5ab2d4340e0a261dd9010d21","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1745213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Hägg","original_name":"Marcus Hägg","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Gunnar","credit_id":"5ab2d44092514116420118bb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorma Markkula","original_name":"Jorma Markkula","popularity":0.1206,"profile_path":"/oQduzpvqQhArEoa1kM8IOqySBmm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"alter Hampus","credit_id":"5ab2d4560e0a261de90114ad","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Folker Banik","original_name":"Folker Banik","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/7aU6Q5w6lAo2cld2178tIxluzsj.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Varietébetreiber","credit_id":"5ab2d46e9251413a05010736","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2004460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Martini","original_name":"Francesco Martini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Messerwerfer","credit_id":"5ab2d47ec3a3686fd20143e3","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1169518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karola Hattop","original_name":"Karola Hattop","popularity":0.1346,"profile_path":"/2G1OIEZQOCwHbAWWnl8qRmHOYtW.jpg","credit_id":"54d611b99251416b9f002008","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1931417","wikidata_id":"Q1196469","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/urEfKgArnuRIKZdyLh9AVRU6P8B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
