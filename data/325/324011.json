Now it's their son, Jody, who will face his own set of challenges. Young Jody Baxter is growing up fast on his parents' modest farm. With three brothers and sisters lost to illness, he's had to work the land just as hard as his daddy. When his only real friend goes \"to visit the angels,\" Jody gets lonely and longs for a pet to share his life. \"Flag,\" an orphaned fawn is his new adopted playmate. With a rekindled spirit, Jody and Flag become an inseparable pair - playing, exploring, and discovering their youthful world. But the new-found joy is only temporary; Flag has become a powerful yearling. When he threatens the family's survival, Jody is faced with the toughest choice of his young life.","popularity":1.8437,"poster_path":"/4McY7YQWMOqtOwvDNwURM3jLJnl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20358,"logo_path":"/jPZ0jwLGGELbSxKoUrJzOytNpnp.png","name":"RHI Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rediscover the classic family tale of struggle, strength, and survival.","title":"The Yearling","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Strauss","original_name":"Peter Strauss","popularity":0.9107,"profile_path":"/nu2QWP09Ju0eMabE0hEmYjm1c6V.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ezra 'Penny' Baxter","credit_id":"54d507bac3a36871c100b6df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Smart","original_name":"Jean Smart","popularity":2.3862,"profile_path":"/kMpcbojxPwDcTAhSsxdfet1v0CS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ory Baxter","credit_id":"54d507be9251417c2300a8ea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":171243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wil Horneff","original_name":"Wil Horneff","popularity":0.3637,"profile_path":"/8KeI291AVho7DW1c9WLhhHisZjF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jody Baxter","credit_id":"54d507ccc3a3685d57009a1c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Seymour Hoffman","original_name":"Philip Seymour Hoffman","popularity":1.6781,"profile_path":"/50rqDkmvXwjwVhFH7q6ph2Rkw7S.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Buck","credit_id":"54d507d9c3a36871c100b6e1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1235028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jarred Blancard","original_name":"Jarred Blancard","popularity":0.4007,"profile_path":"/9nNls64x1e7lWaMBDmiO6Bw6U72.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Fodder-Wing","credit_id":"5f6ca957d55e4d003572875e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Greenquist","original_name":"Brad Greenquist","popularity":0.3517,"profile_path":"/kbucYMeLCNUk03HuP9SxQajEBnI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lem Forrester","credit_id":"5f6ca966c1ffbd0033d943f7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":975134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Moore Atchison","original_name":"Nancy Moore Atchison","popularity":0.209,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Eulalie Boyles","credit_id":"5f6ca973d55e4d0037755d77","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1134774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Nell Santacroce","original_name":"Mary Nell Santacroce","popularity":0.1716,"profile_path":"/qG5XHkQYpHVIs8Bpe0glSJB5teM.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Ma Forrester","credit_id":"67c844c0830570d1fdc2a1aa","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bart Hansard","original_name":"Bart Hansard","popularity":0.106,"profile_path":"/aqdvJ23MXdWLgAzJlPKfrDMidd2.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Millwheel Forrester","credit_id":"67c844cf395b736565e70644","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hamilton","original_name":"Richard Hamilton","popularity":0.31,"profile_path":"/2LkJGXKvRo7tmu6jUhIJ6G4jmXI.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Pa Forrester","credit_id":"67c844dc830570d1fdc2a1cc","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Sowers","original_name":"Scott Sowers","popularity":0.3038,"profile_path":"/5La5xtIg32vkQQfUD0AsdLcF8OD.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Mr. Boyles","credit_id":"67c844f973b7f95da9c2a4b0","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Grady","original_name":"Ed Grady","popularity":0.1962,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Doc Wilson","credit_id":"67c8450a395b736565e70654","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5284485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan F.
