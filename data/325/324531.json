The great Teddy Wilson was on hand to represent the swing piano style; the father of jazz piano improvisation Earl Hines was also present; Lennie Tristano served as an exponent of modern exploratory piano playing; two of the idiom's most lyrical modern pianists, Bill Evans and John Lewis were in attendance, and a nexus between the traditional and the modern, Jaki Byard -who alternated free and stride passages on the same tune- filled out this historical lineup. A notable absence was pianist Bud Powell, who was then living a troublesome period which would end with his death the following year. The two other main influences missing from the performance were Thelonious Monk, who was touring Europe with his own band, and Art Tatum, who had died in 1956.","popularity":0.1088,"poster_path":"/kzS2eWZ4hY8lTvyyrCinGhGnJji.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jaki Byard, Bill Evans, Earl Hines, John Richard Lewis, Lennie Tristano, Teddy Wilson","title":"Berlin Jazz Piano Workshop 1965","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaki Byard","original_name":"Jaki Byard","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Pianist","credit_id":"54d908499251410a4200006c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":137953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Evans","original_name":"Bill Evans","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/iWrrguOQk4LTXKn2Df6wREkTSva.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Pianist","credit_id":"60106244a35c8e00405f87ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2908343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lewis","original_name":"John Lewis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Pianist","credit_id":"6010629a92e55b003e68bd65","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2491963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Hines","original_name":"Earl Hines","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/Au7xb6bX3xJj43iM4o9IgSebq5Z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Pianist","credit_id":"60106349a6ddcb003faff8e3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2252444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teddy Wilson","original_name":"Teddy Wilson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/65czVEfNe3QJfEsLO7bbNuC9kA5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self - Pianist","credit_id":"601063c38ee49c003e64f3f9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2953347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lennie Tristano","original_name":"Lennie Tristano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Pianist","credit_id":"601063f30e597b00403558b4","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9056,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harold Arlen","original_name":"Harold Arlen","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":"/kaarxhfr010sfrIBJtDzidjzwSB.jpg","credit_id":"636fbb44ca4f67007ad993d3","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":825,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kzS2eWZ4hY8lTvyyrCinGhGnJji.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":579}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2007-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
