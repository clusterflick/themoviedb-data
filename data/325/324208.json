Both concerts feature stellar European and American side-musicians including Harry “Sweets” Edison on trumpet and drummer “Papa” Jo Jones – both jazz legends in their own right. The 1962 show is a newly-discovered one-hour concert from the Adolphe Sax Festival in Belgium, which has never been seen. Coleman Hawkins, “The Father of Jazz Saxophone,” demonstrates in these two concerts why he is still considered one of the most important innovators in the history of jazz.","popularity":0.0533,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live in Belgium 1962, Live in England 1964","title":"Jazz Icons - Coleman Hawkins Live in '62 & '64","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coleman Hawkins","original_name":"Coleman Hawkins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"57404fb8c3a3686dc2000248","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
