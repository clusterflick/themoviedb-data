It tells the extraordinary, yet universal story of legendary musician Wilko Johnson who, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and given a few months to live, accepted his fate with uplifting positivity and embarked on a farewell tour, capturing the imagination of the world as he went. But like every good story Wilko's has a damn fine twist in its tail. Two years later and confounding the odds, Wilko wakes up in a hospital bed, unexpectedly sentenced to live, having now to integrate those enlightened lessons learnt under sentence of death into the unexpected and ongoing future of his life.","popularity":0.0897,"poster_path":"/g5ICE5VCVt5nGCY8hLSu8n4cA2p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148894,"logo_path":"/5an0hahm40POymfNsytcxyqr6lG.png","name":"Splice Post","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ecstasy of Wilko Johnson","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilko Johnson","original_name":"Wilko Johnson","popularity":0.1301,"profile_path":"/gjHD352UV6TpIhtVdRYNHIeMpBm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5654f06cc3a368414a000600","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Temple","original_name":"Julien Temple","popularity":0.1619,"profile_path":"/hdaEOb1CAsH4vXWTUHCUvnYLJv0.jpg","credit_id":"54d6a8eec3a3683b920037c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4188192","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g5ICE5VCVt5nGCY8hLSu8n4cA2p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
