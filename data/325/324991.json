Each one struggles to overcome her personal conflict, set against the Occupy Wall Street movements of 2011. These stories touch and inform each other, and create a larger narrative about gender, emigration, power, class, and personal politics.","popularity":0.1528,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":47892,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kostic Films","origin_country":""},{"id":47893,"logo_path":"/jZOQ7JKsZ6LPckWm9JFAjrSgi7Q.png","name":"Surla Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Allure","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladan Nikolić","original_name":"Vladan Nikolić","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f8843a92514118df00165e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladan Nikolić","original_name":"Vladan Nikolić","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f88446c3a368131c001538","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2421868","wikidata_id":"Q20312303","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
