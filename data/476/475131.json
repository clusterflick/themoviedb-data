Called 'suitcase children,' they are thrown into often unstable families. They are still minors, and the French educational system is required to accept them -- even if they're in the country illegally. They must be brought up to speed before being integrated into general or specific areas of study. This is a year where they must find their bearings, adapt to French culture and determine what their future will be.","popularity":0.0744,"poster_path":"/osAhC6hEs3WyCvTDLCJBoHsftun.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enfants valises","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658143,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Xavier de Lauzanne","original_name":"Xavier de Lauzanne","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/vEBurn1K2XLMBCM9uSkXMyC0Qyh.jpg","credit_id":"5d268395b974420012afbaa6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2532030","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/osAhC6hEs3WyCvTDLCJBoHsftun.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
