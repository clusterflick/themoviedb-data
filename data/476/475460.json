There it is discovered that he has a sperm motility rate of 99.5. What that means is that women he comes in contact with, directly or through artificial insemination, stand a terrific chance of becoming pregnant. Alex is naturally proud of his gift, but unfortunately, because he is only average looking, few of the sperm bank patrons are enticed to have his babies. In order to let them known what they are missing, he hires himself a manager and appears on a radio talk show. The ploy works and he suddenly finds himself surround by women desperate to get pregnant one way or another.","popularity":0.3354,"poster_path":"/xYgkKIBBFb0Dl4XBguWbOyctsPb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF |
