Recommended viewing for those in search of introductory Utah history. Also valuable for persons seeking insight into the state as it would have looked during this time period. Especially informative for those desiring a window into the past for a view of how Utah was in the days of their pre-World War II progenitors living in the state. Those whose Utah ancestors were involved in mining, railroading, sugar beets, and other featured industries; featured towns, sights, recreational attractions, and industries may find this otherwise banal travelogue a quite valuable addition to their family history.","popularity":0.2816,"poster_path":"/pMe9neUWPrMGfGzTuRmYkAQzrSC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desert Empire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1887648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manny Nathan","original_name":"Manny Nathan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narration","credit_id":"59ba6c569251413aec00faf6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Wilson","original_name":"Don Wilson","popularity":0.1358,"profile_path":"/wReOo0j7FMViMAYSi1Yxf2IvYHr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"59ba6c649251413ad101042d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1887642,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert M.
