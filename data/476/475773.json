The show opens with a mock-Baroque overture, a nod to Threepenny's source, The Beggar's Opera, a brilliantly successful parody of Handel's operas written by John Gay in 1728. In a brief prologue following the overture, a shabby figure comes onstage with a barrel organ and launches into a song chronicling the crimes of the notorious bandit and womanizer Macheath, \"Mack the Knife.\" The setting is a fair in Soho (London), just before Queen Victoria's coronation.  In this production, Weill champion HK Gruber led the Ensemble Modern in a performance of Weill's complete original score, the first time it had been heard in Germany in many years. This production was broadcast on German television (3sat).","popularity":0.3745,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2027,"logo_path":"/rvHnU0XJniilOjf6IK9ZdXTUKE5.png","name":"3sat","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":163,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
