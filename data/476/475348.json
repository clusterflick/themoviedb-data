Together with documentation of his life, this film shows all his major buildings, as well as rare film footage of Mies explaining his philosophy. Phyllis Lambert relates her choice of Mies as the architect for the Seagram building. Mies's achievements and continuing influence are debated by architects Robert A.M. Stern, Robert Venturi, and Philip Johnson, by former students and by architectural historians. Mies is seen in rare documentary footage.","popularity":0.3967,"poster_path":"/m7LyAiOL0Ga7Wfs0KROC2OsWKKa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94834,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whitney Museum","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1886708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mies van der Rohe","original_name":"Mies van der Rohe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Archive Footage","credit_id":"59b7e2e8925141677f00e523","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1499381,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Philip Johnson","original_name":"Philip Johnson","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59b7e30392514167cd00ec48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert A.M.
