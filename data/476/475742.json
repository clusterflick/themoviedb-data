When their friend Maya dies, they set out on an extraordinary voyage, unknowingly accompanied by her ghostly presence. And while they drift past empty new condo developments, explore crumbling castles, and swim in iridescent quarries, Maya narrates a parallel story about a strange and meandering river that flows both ways.  Flood Tide is a collaboration with the Swimming Cities of Switchback Sea, a project dreamed up by the artist Swoon and built by a group of artists and performers who floated seven large sculptures down the Hudson River. Flood Tide interweaves documentation of this journey with layers of fiction, mythology, and oral history to create a film that both documents and reimagines the real-life project.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/kjXoxJXdl2svfEnFBeasLzxdV0m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A group of artists and musicians, shaken by the death of their friend, build extraordinary boats out of ordinary junk and set out for open water.","title":"Flood Tide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3016652","wikidata_id":"Q88973199","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.643,"height":2016,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kjXoxJXdl2svfEnFBeasLzxdV0m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
