Across six panels, we follow the two men and their fictional counterparts as they race and rescue one another over and over again on a last ride that, thanks to cinema, can extend into infinity. Vin sings a Rihanna ballad to his now fallen friend, who exists within movies but is no longer with us in reality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8TBVs4nw7w8iyV9poy1YWd5cdW8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RIDE OR DIE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1887059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadine E.
