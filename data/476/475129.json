Recorded using a full multi-camera crew and 24-track mobile studio, Goldfinger: Live at the House of Blues was directed by Joe Escalante and mixed by Goldfinger's John Feldmann to capture the band's red-hot sound with true accuracy. These two Punk veterans have teamed up to bring you a concert that is both visually and sonically stunning, while the hits keep coming. Combine this with some really sick stuff done with a twinkie and you have the crown jewel of Kung Fu's DVD series thus far. Enjoy.","popularity":0.1021,"poster_path":"/pmJMOyKkYvuCn4TFCieY4e5hC1C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kung Fu Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Show Must Go Off!","title":"Goldfinger: Live at the House of Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Show Must Go Off!: Goldfinger Live At The House of Blues","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1013045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Feldmann","original_name":"John Feldmann","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/tBwuIkU0o5oIqGprpMCHtzM0D9y.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59b6279fc3a3682aee00c78b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Arthur","original_name":"Brian Arthur","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59b62e06c3a3682aee00cf58","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1885743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darrin Pfeiffer","original_name":"Darrin Pfeiffer","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/nL3znx9d8sJGYqSd6YeFEOtnlW2.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59b62e2f9251417cb500d73d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly LeMieux","original_name":"Kelly LeMieux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59b62e459251417d1700dc10","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907299,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nate Weaver","original_name":"Nate Weaver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c72dd020af77007a247993","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885746,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brian Hodge","original_name":"Brian Hodge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b62ecf9251417cb100df12","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1013044,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe Escalante","original_name":"Joe Escalante","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b62f0cc3a3682aad00d93f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1013044,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe Escalante","original_name":"Joe Escalante","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b628099251417cca00d49e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885745,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jon St. James","original_name":"Jon St. James","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b62e95c3a3682aee00d02f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885732,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Miki Takesue","original_name":"Miki Takesue","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b62cee9251417d0100d53d","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1013045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Feldmann","original_name":"John Feldmann","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/tBwuIkU0o5oIqGprpMCHtzM0D9y.jpg","credit_id":"59b62ea29251417ce200d7c4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0462313","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4zDSLRmB5nYPGa4fA1JQfnOO4me.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.732,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pmJMOyKkYvuCn4TFCieY4e5hC1C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":878}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":237862,"name":"goldfinger"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
