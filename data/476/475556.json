Jovanović, actress M. Zupančič and actors R. Polič and B. Cavazza. This is a story of a love triangle and of a multi-layered, entirely overt intertwining of protagonists’ public artistic personas and their personal lives. The film documents a 4-month process of the making of a theatre piece from the first rehearsal to the opening night, at the same time uncovering the intimate lives of the artists and telling a universal story of the relationship between the real and the imagined, a story of personal and public perceptions of art.","popularity":0.1787,"poster_path":"/sLzRK9rNODHURyQvnCzJXQfNVid.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23084,"logo_path":"/9mcikqGo4XjxS5t1w97FIoYeD0C.png","name":"Vertigo","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":82448,"logo_path":null,"name":"NP7","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2017-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Good Story Is a Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dušan Jovanović","original_name":"Dušan Jovanović","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59b991d4c3a36813f2018485","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milena Zupančič","original_name":"Milena Zupančič","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/q5blRLOA856eDMagNWmdqYPPEQm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"59b991e6c3a36813bc019f97","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Radko Polič","original_name":"Radko Polič","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/lDXpI8R3uVHMX2dGr3wTToCDs79.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59b991f59251417e5d018f2b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Cavazza","original_name":"Boris Cavazza","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/9lnvnxXQTqwO0Tz5KG7VMCndk24.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59b992069251417e03019b0c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150196,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rajko Grlić","original_name":"Rajko Grlić","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":"/ogIuUA8XGFf5nbRQd3nI1pC5NXD.jpg","credit_id":"59b9921d9251417df801a1df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1312874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matjaž Ivanišin","original_name":"Matjaž Ivanišin","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/n6x9PoEVEr2laKs4uR3ooxtIoIg.jpg","credit_id":"59b9922fc3a368137e017eba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":229536,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Danijel Hočevar","original_name":"Danijel Hočevar","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b99248c3a36813e501624f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150196,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rajko Grlić","original_name":"Rajko Grlić","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":"/ogIuUA8XGFf5nbRQd3nI1pC5NXD.jpg","credit_id":"59b9925a9251417e650198ec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150196,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rajko Grlić","original_name":"Rajko Grlić","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":"/ogIuUA8XGFf5nbRQd3nI1pC5NXD.jpg","credit_id":"5a1ad1e80e0a264cbc03f9be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1312874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matjaž Ivanišin","original_name":"Matjaž Ivanišin","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/n6x9PoEVEr2laKs4uR3ooxtIoIg.jpg","credit_id":"5a1ad1f0c3a3680b9d03b84b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6605826","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h9BcA9msaVQdV8zP8XKOc25DYiy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":1532,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sLzRK9rNODHURyQvnCzJXQfNVid.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1063}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14534,"name":"relationship"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
