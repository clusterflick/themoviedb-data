Though there is plenty of action arising from the various passions and grudges scattered among these characters, the opera is best appreciated as a feast of beautiful and dramatic Italianate singing. With virtuosic roles for a quartet of principals, the opera delivers one feat of heroic vocalism after another.","popularity":0.5002,"poster_path":"/9GbdoCHrOUxfXLFEW9NrLelCgCN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
