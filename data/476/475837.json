Famine, poverty and political strife as well as the religious persecution caused by Eritreaâ€™s annexation have already cost countless lives. Narrated by Salem Mekuria, an Ethiopian filmmaker in the US, this lucid documentary presents the life stories of three women refugees in neighboring Sudan. It traces the attempts of individual women to survive displacement, resettlement camps and ineffectual bureaucracy. An astute, politically sophisticated analysis of social and economic crisis from the perspective of Third World women.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/mV4RLMJudMls3rp2U9HAvRCHwOe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sidet: Forced Exile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salem Mekuria","original_name":"Salem Mekuria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/m241KBSO1bQ6LWaPlVSPXbKlm2H.jpg","credit_id":"59bb5f39c3a3680efe008499","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mV4RLMJudMls3rp2U9HAvRCHwOe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
