There is more to Turner than his sublime landscapes - he also painted machines, science, technology and industry. Turner's life spans the Industrial Revolution, he witnessed it as it unfolded and he painted it. In the process he created a whole new kind of art. The programme examines nine key Turner paintings and shows how we should re-think them in the light of the scientific and Industrial Revolution. Includes interviews with historian Simon Schama and artist Tracey Emin.","popularity":0.6338,"poster_path":"/hwE22dR2rFNpLJbotiXsQ6SLWjU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Genius of Turner: Painting the Industrial Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Schama","original_name":"Simon Schama","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":"/rKtJWCsJDZjdyvuW78IKkwdhC1H.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59b9724d9251417dfc0171ca","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2748048","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hwE22dR2rFNpLJbotiXsQ6SLWjU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2936,"name":"artists' life"},{"id":171453,"name":"art history"},{"id":211823,"name":"painter as artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
