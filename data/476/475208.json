Photographed by Academy Award® nominee César Charlone (City of God), the film travels from war-torn Eastern Europe to the color and light of South America and is told through the voice of Willer’s father Alfred (as narrated by Tim Pigott-Smith, Quantum of Solace), who witnessed bureaucratic nightmares, transportations and suicides but survived to build a post-war life as an architect in Brazil. As the world struggles with the current refugee crisis, RED TREES is a timely look at a family besieged by war who finds peace across an ocean.","popularity":0.4476,"poster_path":"/mh6rCpJ2KTAY4hhNj6Bt8ZrEphE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Trees","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Pigott-Smith","original_name":"Tim Pigott-Smith","popularity":0.4072,"profile_path":"/37OZUY7cq8eoWxhKR2VD1ppusJM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"59b6ac7cc3a3682b190165d3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Willer","original_name":"Marina Willer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b6ac6bc3a3682b0a015ce8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8577,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"César Charlone","original_name":"César Charlone","popularity":0.168,"profile_path":"/nFnz9F7opE01LRg5Fa4CPONoIe2.jpg","credit_id":"5b1c5b189251414bd401ffe9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Willer","original_name":"Marina Willer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1e53fc0e0a264fb600a13c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2062023,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian Eley","original_name":"Brian Eley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1e54069251416632008f26","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2062024,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leena Telén","original_name":"Leena Telén","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1e54120e0a264fad00ad8c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193633,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles S.
