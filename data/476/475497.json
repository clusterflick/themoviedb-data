The documentary focuses on exploring the unknown story of Hitler's family and the dramatic fates of those related to the most hated man in history.  It also explores the genetic history of Eva Braun to determine if Hitler and his wife had any Jewish ancestries, and it establishes the claims that Hitlerâ€™s relatives hold to his remaining assets. The film introduces Hitler's living relatives including cousins in Austria, grand-nephews in Germany and New York and his in-laws, including Eva Braun's close cousin, her two sisters and the fates of their respective families and heritage.  Betrayal, murder, conspiracy, physical deformity, incestuous love and robbery are all part of the ongoing tale of the exceptionally dysfunctional Hitler family.","popularity":0.0647,"poster_path":"/9B46AmOHLsSUvSDN9mJOfIsD4Xa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matland Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary film taking a contemporary look at the surviving family of Adolf Hitler.","title":"Uncle Hitler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912614,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Wieland","original_name":"Gary Wieland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f25715c3a368064e03c376","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1022729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Soler","original_name":"Joel Soler","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f257909251416aab039ac9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1444291","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9B46AmOHLsSUvSDN9mJOfIsD4Xa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yI8xwN2DMV8C9Smv1NsstW2KkJ8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
