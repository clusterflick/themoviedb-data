Through a lens of memory and dreams, two girls explore their friendship and the joy of a juicy mandarin in the dry Australian landscape. An evocative montage, the film evokes tactile experiences and revels in the visceral. It's a musing on childhood, kinship, instincts, violence and forgiveness. The children of Mandarin Peel serve as metaphors for Australia itself, its exploration of identity, forging relationships, inventing history and future.","popularity":0.1389,"poster_path":"/31o7DhvYCSY90c207hz3JL8Zgaj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mandarin Peel","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamira Hunter","original_name":"Jamira Hunter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jamira","credit_id":"59bb7ec6c3a3680f50009d86","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minnie Liszukiewicz","original_name":"Minnie Liszukiewicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Minnie","credit_id":"59bb7ed09251413292009b87","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1887453,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna McGrath","original_name":"Anna McGrath","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b9bd1d9251413ad5000b22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1887453,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna McGrath","original_name":"Anna McGrath","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59bb7f339251413273009b93","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888133,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aaron Wilson","original_name":"Aaron Wilson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59bb7fc09251413273009c2c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888134,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marcus Herrick","original_name":"Marcus Herrick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59bb7fe19251413292009c92","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293545,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stefan Duscio","original_name":"Stefan Duscio","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/amvwaxphmGLqufDy5hYkkIOcmER.jpg","credit_id":"5e45c127db8a0000199bc9b6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1474788","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/31o7DhvYCSY90c207hz3JL8Zgaj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5657,"name":"australia"},{"id":10683,"name":"coming of age"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2009-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
