The plot is very simple. A guardian falls in love with a Parisian. Desperate, he commits suicide when she returns to the capital. But, as always with Perret, we appreciate the framing, the skilful use of the exteriors and the documentary side of life of the time. We see the young Arlesianas in traditional dress go out to collect almonds and return with their baskets to the city. The actor in the role of the guardian overreacts, imitating bombastic despair. But the finale, in which he rides a horse through the waves to find the rest of death, preserves its charm intact. Perret knows how to set the rhythm of a sequence and give it the necessary atmosphere.","popularity":0.1821,"poster_path":"/rviwtrO4powhjy10cz1uO2l9qu6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1910-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Guardian of Camargue","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joë Hamman","original_name":"Joë Hamman","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/irjf2Y1VQBEQGoOUcm4rPNxgOZZ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"59bbd15a92514132670103ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Carl","original_name":"Renée Carl","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":"/xKw1iQS28Z7fMGhbNhNk7gyMkYL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"59bbd1629251413267010400","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342331,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Georges Specht","original_name":"Georges Specht","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/613kcomyc9R4TNdIRiWUCeqTYLs.jpg","credit_id":"6184635df8aee80091ea7c12","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1098119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léonce Perret","original_name":"Léonce Perret","popularity":0.1051,"profile_path":"/cZ66nMl9l5GWusnMUOSj8FH4WJu.jpg","credit_id":"59bbd1709251413231010d9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0436344","wikidata_id":"Q3223054","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rviwtrO4powhjy10cz1uO2l9qu6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1910-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
