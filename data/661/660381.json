But this limitation does nothing but feed his vibrant curiosity about his surrounding world.  Most of the film occurs in the classroom of the school that Sky attends, a place that does not end up being friendly enough due to the bullying or the frustration of not being able to perfectly listen to all his classmates.  Director Loes Janssen positions herself from the proximity of Sky's auditory point of view to document our little character in his daily conflict between silence and awareness, a dilemma from which he emerges gracefuly thanks to his unwavering sense of constancy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sky","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6447310","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
