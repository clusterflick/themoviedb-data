Here are all of the reasons why. Featuring rare previously unreleased footage of UFO in concert, this is the long awaited critical review of the album in the company of UFO founder member, the legendary Pete Way. Pete revisits the album after a gap of twenty-five years in the company of some of the UK s leading rock critics and working musicians including fellow UFO member Jem Davis. This powerful film is the definitive portrait of a under rated masterpiece. Featured cuts include a rare promotional film for Only You Can Rock Me. Also included is rare live film of the band performing as a four piece shortly after Michael Schenker joined the band. Never before released on DVD these tracks are included in their entirety as a marvellous record of UFO live onstage at a time when the band was beginning to emerge as a true rock phenomenon.","popularity":0.1595,"poster_path":"/bh1D5yD9rY2dxuKJ2leiUg4tNPE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127356,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art House Classics Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"UFO: Strangers In The Night: The Ultimate Critical Review","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Worlds Greatest Albums Strangers In The Night","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Schenker","original_name":"Michael Schenker","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/7ozaKMAZAZ2o2debf07YJAJqppC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"5e1168bf5907de0012dc4e02","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2204033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Mogg","original_name":"Phil Mogg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kkcuP26HQi7O84KjdCs2bqLpyea.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"5e1168d8e78e2d001375a045","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Raymond","original_name":"Paul Raymond","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Guitar / Keyboards","credit_id":"5e1168f05907de0017dc772c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Way","original_name":"Pete Way","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/qfkkjk9ZHaHrJLnBCAxqZUjPTYy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"5e1168fd9020120018b46d40","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Parker","original_name":"Andy Parker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/tjoxLYB3XZBAx71L827CHINebcy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"5e11695bd64ac200146276ce","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Gormlie","original_name":"Chris Gormlie","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e116a945907de0017dc7b3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2500444,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jayne Anderson","original_name":"Jayne Anderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e116af258361b0010c453e7","department":"Production","job":"Assistant Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2500446,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jerry Bloom","original_name":"Jerry Bloom","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e116b2ed64ac200146279d4","department":"Production","job":"Assistant Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachael Griffiths","original_name":"Rachael Griffiths","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e116b5dae26be0017491f16","department":"Production","job":"Assistant Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2500447,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Braithwaite","original_name":"Martin Braithwaite","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e116b799020120015b45c74","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2500448,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sam Dewhurst","original_name":"Sam Dewhurst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e116b925907de0012dc5070","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2500449,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sam Dewhurst","original_name":"Sam Dewhurst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e116ba25907de0014dc0a47","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aUxHGkBkNEVbaJ7F1xWY4N7Kxu1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1335},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AuRBQH7luBvfGGP53aGKfawQ6cA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bh1D5yD9rY2dxuKJ2leiUg4tNPE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":18001,"name":"rock band"},{"id":18002,"name":"hard rock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD","release_date":"2005-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
