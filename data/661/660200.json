This absurd situation stirs and mobilizes the local community and tourists who gather by the riverbank. On one hand, the whale is a metaphor for the disruption of the ecological system, but at the same time, it's a medium to study people’s reactions to the death of a huge mammal. We observe a sociological portrait of the audience. People speculate and wonder, offer help or ask questions. The sperm whale appeals to everyone, regardless of their social or cultural background. The movie is a complicated riddle. It depicts how close we are to a man-made ecological disaster – what more needs to happen to stop global pollution?","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270753,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Izabela Pająk","original_name":"Izabela Pająk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0e5dad68b1ea00138024ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
