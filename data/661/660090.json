This film, together with another made by American Allies, shows how victory was shaped and achieved.  Africa Freed tells chiefly of the part played by British arms as recorded by our cameramen who marched alongside.  It is a tribute to those fighting with allies in American and France.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gOleXvGEDi4BEd2WMH1OJFXVt69.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Africa Freed","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gOleXvGEDi4BEd2WMH1OJFXVt69.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
