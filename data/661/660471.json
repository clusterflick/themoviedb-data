It was later produced as DVDs for sale at Books Kinokuniya, BooksActually & Objectifs.  Old Places shows us oft-forgotten, yet almost immediately familiar areas in Singapore through the eyes of ordinary people. Prior to the production, members of the public were invited to call in to the radio to recount their significant memories of places in Singapore – places that will soon disappear or be redeveloped.  These personal stories come alive through the callers’ narration and the stunning visuals that capture the nostalgia and hidden beauty of the places. Re-discover Singapore and journey to places like a playground in Toa Payoh, a barbershop at Commonwealth Avenue, Capitol cinema, and an unassuming bakery in Whampoa.  Old Places celebrates personal stories of joy, love or loss, and weaves it into a tapestry of memories amounting to a collective and yet typical story of life in Singapore.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2010-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Places","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2373738,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Tang","original_name":"Eva Tang","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e818d11bf266005a6133ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3645682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victric Thng","original_name":"Victric Thng","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e818da1ad93b005e0fe18a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Royston Tan","original_name":"Royston Tan","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":"/8k4Z3KBcxrFqetVD5o2A5DTuLZn.jpg","credit_id":"5e0f6df5663b8700177f8804","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
