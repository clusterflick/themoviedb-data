And that’s just what she’s suffering from. Twenty years ago Galiao emigrated to Germany, where her dream of becoming a filmmaker came true. But the papayas there never taste as good as in Brazil.  Galiao’s parents live in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, and thanks to Skype her birth country is never far away. Now that her parents need more support, the sense of dislocation is really making its presence felt. “You are physically present, while your mind is somewhere else.” This short film explores and defines the feeling in various ways, both positive and negative.","popularity":0.0872,"poster_path":"/5xf5SaXfOtjREB1w8ohJyqwSEAX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saudade","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2497393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denize Galiao","original_name":"Denize Galiao","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0e72249f37b00015550b39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2497394,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Kalb","original_name":"Michael Kalb","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0e7235663b8700137d1196","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2172338,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Valeria Valenzuela","original_name":"Valeria Valenzuela","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0e725e9f37b0000f550be2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2497395,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dino Osmanoviç","original_name":"Dino Osmanoviç","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e8f51006eee003b83c02e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13567470","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1037,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5xf5SaXfOtjREB1w8ohJyqwSEAX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":691}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2019-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"IDFA 2019 | Trailer | Saudade","key":"362507863","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-09-26T09:10:54.000Z","id":"5e0e71f992e55b001503276b"}]}}}
