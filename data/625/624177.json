They each shot 100 feet of film at the same time of the day 3,000 miles apart, and they did not tell each other what they shot. The film was hand-processed, cut up into two-foot lengths and then cut back together, alternating between Joel's footage and Jon's footage. The soundtrack for this film was done the same way.","popularity":0.0402,"poster_path":"/txvMnOLCzyk3eACeaa2PRWMEh6X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Saints Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1661589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Behrens","original_name":"Jon Behrens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xhZ7SNE1NU8ORphuH2vM4NE69Tk.jpg","credit_id":"5d597cc0da9ef200188d2292","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1871068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Schlemowitz","original_name":"Joel Schlemowitz","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d597cb4d2c0c10015970c17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/txvMnOLCzyk3eACeaa2PRWMEh6X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
