Accompanied by his equally adventurous wife Nicole, who drove a motorcycle with their supplies and pup tent in tow, they planned and executed the journey of a lifetime. Leaving from Sion, Switzerland in 2000, they returned five years later having traversed six continents and thirty-five countries. Alone in the world's most unforgiving landscapes they confronted challenges that threatened to push them beyond their physical and emotional limits - extreme weather, civil unrest, deadly disease, horrific poverty and a variety of other life-threatening events.","popularity":0.4024,"poster_path":"/zjEa58K4wGqCdlDfD6uPQfW2aqK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244590,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lil' Red Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 25,000 Mile Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2838282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Grujicic-Delage","original_name":"Marie Grujicic-Delage","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nicole Roetheli  (voice)","credit_id":"6733dae379280b32169f026e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1523044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Gudenrath","original_name":"Elizabeth Gudenrath","popularity":0.1208,"profile_path":"/bHt8ROByD035kWVstJ4nuJ6DdAG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Clara Nalbone-Sauthier  (voice)","credit_id":"6733db1979280b32169f0291","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51679,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Ridley","original_name":"John Ridley","popularity":0.4446,"profile_path":"/cORKkGcAHz6I6qiFFPMpjFiyxaW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6733db3cc972781b8d73b519","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5055913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Roetheli","original_name":"Nicole Roetheli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6733db7d1baedda17b97e35e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5055918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Roetheli","original_name":"Serge Roetheli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6733dbe6678d3856a76b4af5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223343,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Davies","original_name":"John Davies","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6733da8d79280b32169f0243","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223343,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Davies","original_name":"John Davies","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6733dab5916a0c1700964180","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3484860","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zjEa58K4wGqCdlDfD6uPQfW2aqK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":677}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":235344,"name":"long distance running"},{"id":342309,"name":"charitable causes"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
