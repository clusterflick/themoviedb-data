Koi, 22, returns home for the first time since leaving for college, and does so with an infected ear. He joins his mother Tonet in waiting for his father, both of them clueless as to whether his father could make it home alive after an accident in the extraction tunnel. As Koi reconnects with his hometown in slow decay, he fears the impending possibility of losing both his father and his hearing. Part fiction, part experiment, and purposefully blurring the distinction, Here, Here is a loose visual study on landscapes and terrains, both natural and beyond.","popularity":0.053,"poster_path":"/yvXxnJHFYxQuHSM9VPdpCesfDO9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2019-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Here, Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3720733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kael Vilar","original_name":"Kael Vilar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6335c82de21023007e802481","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2046193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carla Zarcal","original_name":"Carla Zarcal","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/sM9YNqbTPcBByNdyru0yXcn49HS.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6335c834bbd0b000910bf42e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3720736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irish Yes Layas","original_name":"Irish Yes Layas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6335c83ee21023007e80248b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2390776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanne Cesario","original_name":"Joanne Cesario","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5a0510d2c0c1001397d418","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2390776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanne Cesario","original_name":"Joanne Cesario","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec93763d2147c0022bc043f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2097953,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Alvin Francisco","original_name":"Alvin Francisco","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec937796c8492001f2b34a8","department":"Production","job":"Production Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2390776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanne Cesario","original_name":"Joanne Cesario","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec93738140bad001c18fb76","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920238,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Celina Donato","original_name":"Celina Donato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec9376d8e2e00002021d3e2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909767,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jippy Pascua","original_name":"Jippy Pascua","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec93755140bad001b1ac5bf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1932669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alyssa Suico","original_name":"Alyssa Suico","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec937458e2e000021289072","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12252332","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"hereherefilm","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yvXxnJHFYxQuHSM9VPdpCesfDO9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Here, Here (2019) Official Trailer","key":"435789933","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-06T16:07:09.000Z","id":"5f2fb4d1cdf2e6003a21551e"}]}}}
