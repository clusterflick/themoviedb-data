It was also given away at GameStop stores. It contains a 23-minute collection of clips from various NIN music videos, live footage, interviews and the complete video for \"The Hand That Feeds,\" in addition to an interactive \"body of work\" section that also appears on various releases from the same time period. The DVD is censored except for the \"body of work\" section. The card sleeve and the disc itself both contain the sub-title SEED 1, which refers to NIN's promotional material, much like \"halos\" refer to NIN's commercial releases.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tlb2FuLTlf30BnGNgy2V99oYJDe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nine Inch Nails: Collected","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Nine Inch Nails: Seed 01","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tlb2FuLTlf30BnGNgy2V99oYJDe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Rare","release_date":"2005-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
