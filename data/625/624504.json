And how the players responded. Their heroic efforts rewarded when skipper David Gray glanced home the winning header into injury time to finally put to bed.  The story of Hibernian’s Scottish Cup triumph – one of perseverance in the face of adversity – is told by the players themselves in this engrossing and entertaining official DVD. Relive all of the action and hear from the players themselves how the day went from their unique perspective.
