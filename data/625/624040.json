Through a combination of letters, interviews, archival footage, and uncanny reenactments of the period (featuring Garnett herself in the role of her father), this slyly self-reflexive yet deeply felt film provides crucial insights into his largely forgotten accomplishments and Ireland’s history of sociopolitical unrest, while also documenting the father and daughter’s belated reunion.","popularity":0.0631,"poster_path":"/uPXzsXNEaszPBRJlcfQq588APXk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trouble","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1467265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariah Garnett","original_name":"Mariah Garnett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d58d9fd7614210018c01eff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1467265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariah Garnett","original_name":"Mariah Garnett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da893edb7b69d0015e94a2c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1467265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariah Garnett","original_name":"Mariah Garnett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da89323944a570015263dac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10381532","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1314,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uPXzsXNEaszPBRJlcfQq588APXk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":876},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rW8bHaTcNzw83ThE3wxukLNHbl.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mhiNfkLzZv5sp2FGD0tTnbzB0XU.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"London Film Festival","release_date":"2019-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"2019-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TROUBLE trailer | BFI London Film Festival 2019","key":"bVuu5d8Gvjo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2019-09-25T12:55:51.000Z","id":"5da8922de6d3cc0018b0511a"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trouble Trailer","key":"350377229","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-07-26T18:47:34.000Z","id":"5da893a870309f0014661b23"}]}}}
