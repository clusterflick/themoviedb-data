The factory where Harrie Vermeulen works is in a sorry state. But there's good news. If Harrie manages to produce 7,000 boxes of bonbons by six o'clock that evening, a Russian delegation is willing to save the business. Harrie gives it his all, squeezing out one bonbon after another with squeaking and creaking gears. But will he succeed? The machines are heavily outdated and often stop more than they run. In a hysterical whirlpool of confectionery chaos, the most impossible situations arise one after another, ensuring the uproarious laughter that has become so familiar in Jon van Eerd's theaters. You'll never be able to eat a bonbon without a smile again.","popularity":0.0744,"poster_path":"/wi915IJnbhGDtKY1t1kUzYJ4FkZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":247120,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jon van Eerd Pretpakhuis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bonbon Factory","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon van Eerd","original_name":"Jon van Eerd","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/mxs8rewGPVdJ4ZZJvavpYE5lRJV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Harrie Vermeulen","credit_id":"65f0d68d726fb1014ac3fa88","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Kraaijkamp Jr.","original_name":"Johnny Kraaijkamp Jr.","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":"/bPchJsRikXHqGK7pdMSlz872DnV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65f0d6a3726fb10163c3ff40","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4588550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anouk van Nes","original_name":"Anouk van Nes","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65f0d6ae2fdec60189201a77","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4411703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karel Simons","original_name":"Karel Simons","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65f0d6b606f9840185421119","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5115266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Frerichs","original_name":"Caroline Frerichs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b580cff98ee7f0377d7de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4762573,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Marjolein Ettema","original_name":"Marjolein Ettema","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b5818124d90d80709e2f6","department":"Art","job":"Decorator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2378002,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Pelle Herfst","original_name":"Pelle Herfst","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":"/pJAzHKK5w2pBQkJfJwN0ag13Q8b.jpg","credit_id":"675b5825124d90d80709e300","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4698144,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Marie Lauwers","original_name":"Marie Lauwers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675b5831124d90d80709e310","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31714964","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hFhAYK6xtIEBPxnePpGvjx3pBXG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/wi915IJnbhGDtKY1t1kUzYJ4FkZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
