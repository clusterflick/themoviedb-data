Although its environment is at the brink of ecological disaster, the people here still believe in the state’s promise of immortality that can be gained through sacrificial service to the fatherland. This is how the elite in a totalitarian state buy a person’s will, strength, talent and, indeed, life, turning the human being into another resource that is as faceless as a grey lump of ore. ‘I cannot fight big corporations or state structures with a film. But I hope that there is someone in the darkness of the cinema whose heart will get a bit warmer after seeing it,’ says the director. The larger part of the film was shot during the polar night.","popularity":0.276,"poster_path":"/xmWo7o17thp6vwmQEPKfFvnaIFY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103826,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vesilind","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS
