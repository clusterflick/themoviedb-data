As if demanding guests and a snooty neighbor aren't bad enough, the campsite is also threatened with closure. In an attempt to keep the tent standing, our main character sinks deeper and deeper into a hilarious whirlpool of problems, fabrications, and misunderstandings. In this farce, Jon van Eerd is once again supported by a host of well-known personalities such as Pamela Tevens, known from 'Onderweg naar Morgen', and Lucie de Lange, who considered the farce the best reason to return to Dutch theaters.","popularity":0.0717,"poster_path":"/zgdpyR3F3LEs9eKx5K7lo5orEGc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Zip Too Far","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon van Eerd","original_name":"Jon van Eerd","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/mxs8rewGPVdJ4ZZJvavpYE5lRJV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65f0d9540e4fc80163ca2346","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1148076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Teves","original_name":"Pamela Teves","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":"/gZKPEGGH3BvMbTTnW28fMZLwoNN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65f0d975eea34d0188121f5c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4588332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucie de Lange","original_name":"Lucie de Lange","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":"/bhoozJ5tTVeStdiAb5UODsir4io.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65f0d98e2da8460187010aa1","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31713762","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zgdpyR3F3LEs9eKx5K7lo5orEGc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":843}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
