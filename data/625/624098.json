It consists of live performances of \"Feedbacker\" and \"Flood\", music videos for \"A Bao A Qu\" and \"The Evil One Which Sobs\", and the titular short film Heavy Metal Me. The short film is actually a series of chapters on the disc which play in a random order every time the user hits play (though the chapters for each language remain together). Filmed primarily in black and white, the piece is deliberately low quality and aged, with guitarist Wata playing the lead; most chapters feature analog hiss and white noise for audio tracks, though some are totally silent, and others contain acoustic guitar plucks atop the hiss. Notably the DVD has no \"play all\" button and each portion must be played individually from the menu.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rENrH87Ov8wsflE6HUzWxhfBWmM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62540,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diwphalanx","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2005-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heavy Metal Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1505110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wata","original_name":"Wata","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/8wBP19qz85QXTRqMozoB6kExae1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d5930ab1749730017ddc1ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atsuo Mizuno","original_name":"Atsuo Mizuno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ysAwgrSGfGEXDU4qAvfBx9Q6tdc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66d954cd2e4b6922eebf7087","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takeshi Ohtani","original_name":"Takeshi Ohtani","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/4uTxQYULVLSdmpEIq9ll9ZVK6Sn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"himself","credit_id":"66d954eec2d1343e7db8d394","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505118,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ryuta Murayama","original_name":"Ryuta Murayama","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df1877518b7510012408b4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1505110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wata","original_name":"Wata","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/8wBP19qz85QXTRqMozoB6kExae1.jpg","credit_id":"66d955bd258c3c400d184635","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atsuo Mizuno","original_name":"Atsuo Mizuno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ysAwgrSGfGEXDU4qAvfBx9Q6tdc.jpg","credit_id":"66d955c5e4153086e91ad75a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takeshi Ohtani","original_name":"Takeshi Ohtani","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/4uTxQYULVLSdmpEIq9ll9ZVK6Sn.jpg","credit_id":"66d955cc693cc3faf4270d0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rENrH87Ov8wsflE6HUzWxhfBWmM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
