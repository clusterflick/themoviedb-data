Eco-activist Rod Coronado has made it his life’s mission to advocate for the planet and the rights of animals. In 2014, he formed Wolf Patrol, an activist group which fights to preserve the grey wolves which roam Wisconsin’s forests. After 30 years of radical environmental action that earned Coronado the label, \"eco-terrorist\", Operation Wolf Patrol follows Rod's journey to redefine his activism. As ‘hunter harassment’ laws strengthen the rights of hunters in the States, Coronado is forced to make a momentous choice: retain his own freedom, or risk prison to continue his quest to protect America’s wildlife.","popularity":0.1231,"poster_path":"/nmhrPZ1FdCueN8IomvTtvBOEjIX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172507,"logo_path":null,"name":"Starz Down to Earth Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Operation Wolf Patrol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3485456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rod Coronado","original_name":"Rod Coronado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"624394bdc50ad2005cdcd650","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369651,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mario Andrew Fierro","original_name":"Mario Andrew Fierro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6243cf279652200091cf230c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3485620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Brown","original_name":"Joseph Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6243cec4c50ad20047ff1df7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3485620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Brown","original_name":"Joseph Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6243cf16706e56008be0199f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3485620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Brown","original_name":"Joseph Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6243cf0976eecf0047c96842","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3485620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Brown","original_name":"Joseph Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6243cef30d2944005be4e2b7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14906656","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nmhrPZ1FdCueN8IomvTtvBOEjIX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1112},{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1518,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u9yapnkBBtMfNFjY1jhuxXxkLLV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1056}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Operation Wolf Patrol | Trailer | Available Now","key":"p_vAyRHseIU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2021-11-16T10:38:56.000Z","id":"6243d28d3e09f30087c83088"}]}}}
