Thousands of people with disabilities were left in the dark and had to make the call weeks before to lockdown as it was inevitable that we would die if we caught the virus. Food was impossible to access because we couldn't go out or get delivery slots, and even if we did panic buyers made it impossible to get the items we desperately needed.  We were truly isolated, unable to have family and friends visit. Having carers coming in and out of the house was risky and many disabled people felt that having basic care was putting their lives at risk.","popularity":0.5265,"poster_path":"/qL7KWHr6mKkskmfIxStfBbvW79U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living in Fear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Castelete-Tyrrell","original_name":"Stephanie Castelete-Tyrrell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6065d5edec0c5800705a6053","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Castelete-Tyrrell","original_name":"Stephanie Castelete-Tyrrell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6065d5de4ca676006f6f7b43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qL7KWHr6mKkskmfIxStfBbvW79U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2564,"name":"wheelchair"},{"id":6634,"name":"wheelchair user   "},{"id":158558,"name":"disabled"},{"id":162735,"name":"disability"},{"id":186523,"name":"lockdown"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":188973,"name":"pandemic"},{"id":195593,"name":"physical disability"},{"id":196785,"name":"woman in wheelchair"},{"id":245776,"name":"disabled person"},{"id":263237,"name":"covid-19"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Living In Fear - Official Trailer","key":"453269551","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-08-31T12:17:16.000Z","id":"6065d5a531d09b0058a1a228"}]}}}
