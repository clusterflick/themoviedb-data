In 1964 he followed his research work to London where he settled and participated in the founding of the London Filmmaker’s Co-op. His experimental films, for which he himself does the camera work, play with ideas of desire, sexual and mental solitude and the passage of time. In his films he also explores representation in cinema, performances, personal impressions and his own physical handicap which has been a source of inspiration for him throughout his career.  His sensitive and emancipating works have been the subject of various international presentations.","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":"/fUkam7mKl09IOk6zXMRbzXHtpCP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinexpérimentaux #9: Stephen Dwoskin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Dwoskin","original_name":"Stephen Dwoskin","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":"/czK2KmlaMJtYOHQeebFlshC8ku6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6063ef85db8a00003c1d02d1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1668826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédérique Devaux","original_name":"Frédérique Devaux","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/AnE42MyouSJemHvSCu8cc9fCJmB.jpg","credit_id":"6063efa10e64af003e1df370","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Amarger","original_name":"Michel Amarger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6063efae7dfda6002849b28e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1108,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fUkam7mKl09IOk6zXMRbzXHtpCP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":739},{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1108,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nFvctJ0C10gBO8NFqYaZ82J3661.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":775}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Frédérique Dévaux et Michel Amarger - Cinexpérimentaux 9: STEPHEN DWOSKIN (trailer)","key":"haf80kUfIVc","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-05T15:19:57.000Z","id":"62b59ba5e7c09705352f3a8b"}]}}}
