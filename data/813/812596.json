This film is an edited composition of such experiments, with some archival footage bits from a military instructional film to help get the idea across. All of the patterns on the film were drawn, scratched, colored or ink-jet transferred and applied by hand. Every sound in the film is simultaneously accompanied by the picture that produced it.","popularity":0.0733,"poster_path":"/x2I999i9Rcy9frIGYjA9TUNqltG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Optical Audio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Wood","original_name":"Steve Wood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6065014a3520e80042eeef10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x2I999i9Rcy9frIGYjA9TUNqltG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CIMMFest 2015","release_date":"2015-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
