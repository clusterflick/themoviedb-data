This experimental performance will combine live video and audio synthesis, transmissions and interference, and echoing synesthetic landscapes, adapted to the medium of online streaming. Patterns and behaviors produced through video feedback systems can resemble natural phenomena such as fractals and fluid dynamics, while radio signals which pervade the space we inhabit are collected, made audible, and manipulated in space and time. All these elements combine to form an ambient, evolving audiovisual environment.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Electromagnetic Environments","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3030788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paloma Kop","original_name":"Paloma Kop","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606324b81b7c59003cdcb971","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
