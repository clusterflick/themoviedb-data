Life and death, good and evil are evoked as the incantatory voiceovers and sordid images make reference to communion, transfusions, bloodbaths, bloodlust, vampires and the specter of a virus loose in contemporary culture. Steeped in paranoia and dread, this work describes a subconscious search that is, in Oursler's words, \"based on a movie, based on a book, based on a poem, based on a myth, which is based on the quest for human immortality.\"","popularity":0.0491,"poster_path":"/91mfTk2PBLiCQGkuV7TGL0AI5I4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sucker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Oursler","original_name":"Tony Oursler","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/lcn8zD8Z6rSYQ8Owo6IYvZWvWuV.jpg","credit_id":"60652a8d5ed9620057f5c6be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/91mfTk2PBLiCQGkuV7TGL0AI5I4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
