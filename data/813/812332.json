The local chief of police savagely beat him, leaving him unconscious and permanently blind. The shocking incident made national headlines and, when the police chief was acquitted by an all-white jury, the blatant injustice would change the course of American history. Based on Richard Gergel’s book Unexampled Courage, the film details how the crime led to the racial awakening of President Harry Truman, who desegregated federal offices and the military two years later. The event also ultimately set the stage for the Supreme Court’s landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, which finally outlawed segregation in public schools and jumpstarted the modern civil rights movement.","popularity":1.6068,"poster_path":"/zdnR6XWY1kr01WarF4MIeV4QHJW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37385,"logo_path":"/y3FPjH0kunToOvzZyoOnNNBi6TI.png","name":"Ark Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"GBH","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The event that opened the eyes of a nation.","title":"The Blinding of Isaac Woodard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":459980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Holland","original_name":"André Holland","popularity":0.9998,"profile_path":"/riYqFOgYLYH4Hw8p2JYTw5lXGDE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"60664ced9408ec002ae0fb54","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":171168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leland Gantt","original_name":"Leland Gantt","popularity":0.1019,"profile_path":"/pZkbrBIHnOKglP5s5m3KCPISEkb.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Isaac Woodward (voice)","credit_id":"60664e09158c850027fe06b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Mack","original_name":"Kenneth Mack","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"606afb50699fb7006fc7d18e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1936475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sherrilyn Ifill","original_name":"Sherrilyn Ifill","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"606afb6f124c8d002900500d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rawn James","original_name":"Rawn James","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"606afb7b0c3ec800409bc16e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Gergel","original_name":"Richard Gergel","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Self","credit_id":"606afb8702576400427c6a82","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Belinda Gergel","original_name":"Belinda Gergel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Self","credit_id":"606afb9412c604006eaf2637","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Young Sr.","original_name":"Robert Young Sr.","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Self","credit_id":"606afba3d29bdd005724a81a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Sullivan","original_name":"Patricia Sullivan","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Self","credit_id":"606afbb1124c8d003f389e34","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Williams","original_name":"Laura Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Self","credit_id":"606afbc9124c8d003f389e5e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilbert King","original_name":"Gilbert King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"Self","credit_id":"606afbd59ca759005784f5ab","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kari Frederickson","original_name":"Kari Frederickson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":27,"character":"Self","credit_id":"606afbf61cc4ff004038ecd9","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
