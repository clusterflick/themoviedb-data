The Body Remembers chronicles Francisco Ibanez-Carrasco's struggle to make drag into a form of artesania (not art) that heals. Drag allows us to present our damaged selves to others when we are disfigured and ugly by conventional standards. Ibanez-Carrasco struggled with Kaposi's Sarcoma and other AIDS-related opportunistic infections at that time and drag shows were a way to bring his extended family around him and to create awareness about AIDS.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vKxgyfVUcRwoVQ8eLoqaqcOTqVg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Body Remembers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Ibanez-Carrasco","original_name":"Francisco Ibanez-Carrasco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60640b3746f3540028188223","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Ibanez-Carrasco","original_name":"Francisco Ibanez-Carrasco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60640b4f0e64af002961d91e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Ibanez-Carrasco","original_name":"Francisco Ibanez-Carrasco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60640b5b8d22fc0053e1a92b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vKxgyfVUcRwoVQ8eLoqaqcOTqVg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Body Remembers - Experimental AIDS Memoir Short 1997","key":"ScyGM1GWzGc","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-02-09T14:11:28.000Z","id":"60640b837dfda60054e1cbb8"}]}}}
