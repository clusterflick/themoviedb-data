X was making another cup of very sugary tea. Y, stirring the kindling, yelled as he accidentally grabbed a burning twig. “are you trying to clean your fingerprints?” laughed X.  ‘A Rough History’ is a performance lecture, installation and 16mm film following several visits to Calais, that considers a practice by migrants entering the EU of destroying their fingerprints to avoid detection by the Eurodac system, alongside other histories of fingerprinting and fingerprint erasures. It sees the fingerprint as a scaled down landscape, looking at the circulation of the image of the fingerprint, and the different lives and journeys of the migrants whose hands produce such images.","popularity":0.0993,"poster_path":"/qBqOp3C8OlvYbPQfnkbDXnkg2Co.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"'To live means to leave traces’ (W Benjamin)","title":"A Rough History (of the destruction of fingerprints)","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2720402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ayesha Hameed","original_name":"Ayesha Hameed","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/n0Mdncl1DDfuht1Jh7BDe6ox4h1.jpg","credit_id":"606582a438469a0058047682","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qBqOp3C8OlvYbPQfnkbDXnkg2Co.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y54MyrLiSQHiXZjhTp7jurx5j9S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://mosaicrooms.org/event/fingerprints/","release_date":"2017-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Rough History (of the destruction of fingerprints) ","key":"298745242","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-11-03T14:44:10.000Z","id":"606582ccb84f940058f6f23b"}]}}}
