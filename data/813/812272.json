They are of various parts of a domestic interior, tabletop, sofa, mantle-piece, kitchen sink etc. and are ordered as autonomous sequences of shots. As such they constitute a narrative.  The soundtrack, a series of domestic sounds and conversations constitutes a separate narrative. Occasionally sound and image coincide in different ways, but for the most part they are juxtaposed. The conversation will concern the relationship of two people living together.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cup of Tea – A Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3020262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Bruce","original_name":"Tim Bruce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6063ae4bd7a70a0074338744","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
