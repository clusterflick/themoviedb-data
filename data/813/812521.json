Taking as its starting point a female subjective position the film explores the narrative of post-Soviet transition, the militarisation of public space and the gendered divisions in the experience of the city. Constructed as a gap between the space of the city and the space of the film, it is composed of diverse layers of visual and sound material, ranging from archive sources, found footage, footage filmed through television sets, voice-over narrations, music and location sound.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Pink City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3032248,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tamman Hamza","original_name":"Tamman Hamza","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6064ac1b2dffd8006fe36c4a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3032249,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aaron Kay","original_name":"Aaron Kay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6064ac4945765d00299b09b8","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3032247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aikaterini Gegisian","original_name":"Aikaterini Gegisian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6064ac39258823003f33fa56","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3032247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aikaterini Gegisian","original_name":"Aikaterini Gegisian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6064abf3a314400057c3424e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
