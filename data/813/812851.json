The violence has had an impact on almost every home and many families have no adult male members. The film looks at the impact of this violence on the lives of those left bereft by it. Women affected by the loss of their close ones have somatized the psychological devastation they have suffered onto their bodies. Young people have nothing to look forward to and a depressing environment has a cascading effect on children who see sadness and tragedy all around them.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2012-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Textures of Loss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pankaj Butalia","original_name":"Pankaj Butalia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"6066154a158c8500589c524d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pankaj Butalia","original_name":"Pankaj Butalia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60661531124c8d003f316f61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ranjan Palit","original_name":"Ranjan Palit","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/hGG6diFYa6mPYVq69PhtIAuPxBc.jpg","credit_id":"6066153a9f5dfb007976999b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2364360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
