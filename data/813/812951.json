In 2009 Pina returned to Chile for  her last residency before her passing that June. Eddie and I have continued our friendship ever since  bonded by our love for Pina. In 2016, we collaborated on a short dance film. I told Eddie how I wanted  to dance with the camera while he moved in the waters of Castle Island, MA. The film was shown as  a 16mm projected loop for an expanded cinema event at the Boston Waterworks Museum. After that  event I digitized the work print projected that night and created Temple Island, an ode to the body as  our motor and our temple.","popularity":0.2402,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Temple Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Martinez","original_name":"Eddie Martinez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60664f2b158c850042a594c8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anto Astudillo","original_name":"Anto Astudillo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60664f38bc2cb3006e111d63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033804,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"ChombaDJ","original_name":"ChombaDJ","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60664f8de1ad79002906a75a","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":235797,"name":"dance film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
