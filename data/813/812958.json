Cities from metropolitan areas are usually labeled like this because of the workforce that commutes out everyday to work in the capital. In this daily movement, many times, ideas are conceived and creativity flourishes. I believe that this is one of the reasons why those cities often have a lively cultural scene. The documentary \"This is Canoas not POA\" makes this very clear: Canoas has a lot to show in terms of a music scene that's independent, diverse, creative, and most important, united. Bands, night clubs, studios, producers, record shops. Everything a music scene needs to develop is very well documented here. Watch it and create your own scene, start your own band!","popularity":0.2053,"poster_path":"/kKRZC2Zdf0jtsINYSXiiovqvRwu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Is Canoas Not POA","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033863,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Renato Chama","original_name":"Renato Chama","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6066556463d713006e9130fb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033878,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonas Dalacorte","original_name":"Jonas Dalacorte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6066562f724de10040fac936","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033862,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Izza Balbinot","original_name":"Izza Balbinot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60665550e1ad79002906b188","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033877,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gabriela Garcia","original_name":"Gabriela Garcia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6066561c724de10040fac910","department":"Production","job":"Research Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033861,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roger Neres","original_name":"Roger Neres","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6066553ebc2cb30041f2c920","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033866,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pedro Rheinheimer","original_name":"Pedro Rheinheimer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606655880a94d4006cb1fa2c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033869,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Daniel Hogrefe","original_name":"Daniel Hogrefe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606655bb9f5dfb007976fa09","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wender Zanon","original_name":"Wender Zanon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6079ff3dfbe36f0078e1a437","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wender Zanon","original_name":"Wender Zanon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6079ff54f6787a002999d8a3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033878,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonas Dalacorte","original_name":"Jonas Dalacorte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6079ffc87a97ab00409ea57f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wender Zanon","original_name":"Wender Zanon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6079ff487a97ab0029d6caa9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14356190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"thisiscanoas","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/plWeUqPS1N3hLELuWblolWmGE4U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.834,"height":507,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6ez6Mb1d2gN7Ww13DokI4oOz82j.png","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":930},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xoudW3Qlu6dg577VRrDMrlvPPgW.png","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1366},{"aspect_ratio":1.772,"height":645,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bJELqnF9h7wb2b4S8ZRpEtAokOl.png","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1143}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kKRZC2Zdf0jtsINYSXiiovqvRwu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":682}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":11700,"name":"rock music"},{"id":192515,"name":"garage rock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
