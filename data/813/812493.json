Once they formed a celebrated piano duo with a blossoming career in the United States. Just as the instrument is actually a little too big for their modest residence, the sisters’ personalities no longer seem to fit their now fragile bodies. In this final part of her trilogy on old age and art (preceded by Las cinéphilas and Le temps perdu), María Alvarez follows these elderly ladies as they shuffle along the path of their memories, which surround them in every corner of their house.","popularity":0.055,"poster_path":"/u8knAiD7azwerOvUnrVg9hnRxHj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2022-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Near and Dear","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5316255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amelia Cavallini","original_name":"Amelia Cavallini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"67db6e505ef4639ebae791c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5316257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Cavallini","original_name":"Isabel Cavallini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"67db6e68c60d5177ade9ec4f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2714571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Álvarez","original_name":"María Álvarez","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/ArUIhCGUn7wZbgwVYgEyqVjMgbA.jpg","credit_id":"6064973d9f1be700288d5f34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2714575,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tirso Díaz-Jares Rueda","original_name":"Tirso Díaz-Jares Rueda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606497ae6f6a99003da97da4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2714571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Álvarez","original_name":"María Álvarez","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/ArUIhCGUn7wZbgwVYgEyqVjMgbA.jpg","credit_id":"606497421685da003d1a9728","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2714571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Álvarez","original_name":"María Álvarez","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/ArUIhCGUn7wZbgwVYgEyqVjMgbA.jpg","credit_id":"6189bcbf66a7c30092c9b334","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2714575,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tirso Díaz-Jares Rueda","original_name":"Tirso Díaz-Jares Rueda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6189bce2cb6db50042c7c66f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2714571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Álvarez","original_name":"María Álvarez","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/ArUIhCGUn7wZbgwVYgEyqVjMgbA.jpg","credit_id":"6189bcd5160e730029e2d30d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2714571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Álvarez","original_name":"María Álvarez","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/ArUIhCGUn7wZbgwVYgEyqVjMgbA.jpg","credit_id":"6189bccbfe63180044bfb65a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122688,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martín Grignaschi","original_name":"Martín Grignaschi","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6189bced075288008d169482","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15943548","wikidata_id":"Q117008294","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/XqX6nXQVMkMQ5MZJgHHiObiHlY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u8knAiD7azwerOvUnrVg9hnRxHj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jecheon International Music & Film Festival","release_date":"2022-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Documentary Festival Amsterdam","release_date":"2021-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
