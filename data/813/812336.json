An avid defender of Super-8mm film (which he has been using for 30 years), he has fought for the acknowledgement of its excellence as a film-making tool. His work, which screens in festivals and at international events, has been the subject of numerous interviews and articles. Flamboyant, baroque and sensual, his work revolves primarily around the question of the body and the sacred.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gtWXsqEtVpLUxlqjWchimEAQMHT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinexpérimentaux #7: Stéphane Marti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1340468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Marti","original_name":"Stéphane Marti","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/goQU4fcq4kFed6jfkioPKbcdpk6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6063eec2d6d64d006b5d4047","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1668826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédérique Devaux","original_name":"Frédérique Devaux","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/AnE42MyouSJemHvSCu8cc9fCJmB.jpg","credit_id":"6063eed18f26bc0055a45279","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Amarger","original_name":"Michel Amarger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6063eedcd7a70a003ca5fe2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1512,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gtWXsqEtVpLUxlqjWchimEAQMHT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1008}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
