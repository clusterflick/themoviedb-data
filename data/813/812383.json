In the film, Madhukar and Jaggu are Hitler-like tyrants who rule over a small community with an iron hand. They prefer to keep the inhabitants illiterate, so that they can continue to oppress and abuse them over time. But one young lad, Ramu, educates himself secretly with the help of the local school-master, Srikanth. Years later, Ramu has grown up and is now a formidable force to reckon with. Madhukar and Jaggu see him as a threat and soon spin a web of lies and deceit around him, leaving him with no alternative except to retreat, leaving the poor villagers once again at their mercy of their oppressors.","popularity":0.2279,"poster_path":"/xx9m5grawTg05QNQHnjyPSYqANW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trisulam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sridevi","original_name":"Sridevi","popularity":1.055,"profile_path":"/lQHnDO0PU0p3d1nKDvjkdk60J97.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lakshmi","credit_id":"60640d1bf056d50052a24746","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1335737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krishnam Raju","original_name":"Krishnam Raju","popularity":0.1306,"profile_path":"/bvZLQkr6U1kNNWmHZsRnPXOpg4J.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ramu","credit_id":"60640d2ad7a70a0074344167","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jayasudha","original_name":"Jayasudha","popularity":0.4306,"profile_path":"/xOP3pYlrqyBw5x9CDEMkYXPzpNu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Neeli","credit_id":"60640d360fb39800548ca4ce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":562177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Radikaa Sarathkumar","original_name":"Radhika Sarathkumar","popularity":0.7611,"profile_path":"/kEKzT8HAJw8lfFUtWWd0SoQ9kC9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Yadi","credit_id":"60640d531b7c59003cde39fa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1267544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prabhakar Reddy","original_name":"Prabhakar Reddy","popularity":0.3013,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60640d61048638003df5650e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gollapudi Maruti Rao","original_name":"Gollapudi Maruti Rao","popularity":0.1781,"profile_path":"/n2Dg7xVS8OqTB7Pfc09JtodZUfa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hitler Raghaviah","credit_id":"60640d781b7c5900288ac3d7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rao Gopal Rao","original_name":"Rao Gopal Rao","popularity":0.2305,"profile_path":"/5s1FqtrDKSc35NUCH42cPPbtSSs.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pentaiah","credit_id":"60640d840b5fd60056ce602c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allu Ramalingaiah","original_name":"Allu Ramalingaiah","popularity":0.2479,"profile_path":"/czibmtfWzU1VmJC5F6TsnCy24Md.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lingam","credit_id":"60640d951685da003d1a1ae0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chalapathi Rao","original_name":"Chalapathi Rao","popularity":0.2011,"profile_path":"/51zzAobEchxSwHI1b4tUxrVpQaz.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Bhadraiah","credit_id":"60640da8f056d50052a247d0","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"K Raghavendra Rao","original_name":"K Raghavendra Rao","popularity":0.235,"profile_path":"/aXUNYnHOFs7GTJPKkscsFjtbUgo.jpg","credit_id":"60640dbf8f26bc00776e100d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335978,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"K Murari","original_name":"K Murari","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60640dd9f056d50073561ad5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584606,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"K.
