Original and never-before-seen footage documents his self-made journey to iconic garage rock star, with colleagues, friends, and family speaking candidly about Jay's vibrant and complicated life. Jay Reatard himself - filmed just nine months before his untimely death at the age of twenty-nine - shares his experiences both on and off stage, with all the humor, savvy, and pathos one can expect from such a prolific and vital artist.","popularity":0.12,"poster_path":"/X6Wyvgf2TiL5yuWLdusdySh4CA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Better Than Something: Jay Reatard","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1026333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Reatard","original_name":"Jay Reatard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49e8c3a36847f81acee7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1026332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Markiewicz","original_name":"Ian Markiewicz","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/jfmIc6ZSCMD6tEeE6tzAmSKfOYo.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49e8c3a36847f81acee3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":928685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Hammond","original_name":"Alex Hammond","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/fhiFnBzrTC0kgvX7s6hXCGS72AH.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49e8c3a36847f81acedd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1800669","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vsty7Y0qUJR3VQfqe5CBZlDuoHX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1296,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/X6Wyvgf2TiL5yuWLdusdySh4CA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":864},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6LxjwEKGPwZqwdsOOHdxkSatZyd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1334,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bXOfkdAd1aI1uowgo6jOxE5Zb0f.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":889}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
