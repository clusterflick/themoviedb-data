Promising concept is bolstered by colorful performances by Gotz Otto and Lars Rudolph, and the filmmakers have fun with pic’s look, right down to tacky lighting worthy of Roger Corman. But Marc Meyer’s script isn’t fast or funny enough to keep pace with energetic visuals. The first in a projected series of B-movie homages grouped as “Planet B,” the producers might want to call in Joe Dante to supervise the rest, as “Antman” seems unlikely to crawl very far beyond its native borders","popularity":0.4583,"poster_path":"/pLwGsODdS9uJIwTp40RFrsSEkRd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28954,"logo_path":null,"name":"TTD Checkpoint Berlin Filmproductions GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":119150,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemedia","origin_country":""},{"id":264,"logo_path":"/fA90qwUKgPhMONqtwY60GaHRyrW.png","name":"Studio Babelsberg","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't bring your wife to see this film.","title":"The Antman","video":false,"vote_average":6.333,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Antrage - Der Ameisenmann","type":"DVD title"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Planet B: The Antman","type":"promotional title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Götz Otto","original_name":"Götz Otto","popularity":0.5403,"profile_path":"/gUIvsX30Uey3KXYA5VYx5XvcRqf.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Don José de Alvarez","credit_id":"52fe49fac3a36847f81b0f43","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1031123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasmina Filali","original_name":"Yasmina Filali","popularity":0.2582,"profile_path":"/tA8VCo5ws93pU8Uyj5fKEgvxqHV.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Bella Bonita","credit_id":"52fe49fac3a36847f81b0f47","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Rudolph","original_name":"Lars Rudolph","popularity":0.2121,"profile_path":"/1C1tHlJpvWmyfnfqjpi5tHDs4jn.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Loco Satano","credit_id":"52fe49fac3a36847f81b0f4b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Volkmann","original_name":"Elisabeth Volkmann","popularity":0.2273,"profile_path":"/zzLwGFforrXbxAAPZJ0vwcPjXiN.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"El Busto","credit_id":"52fe49fac3a36847f81b0f4f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gojko Mitić","original_name":"Gojko Mitić","popularity":0.9916,"profile_path":"/mPHF1GvdLVDJXtRq7X0Qe4uKFl.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Fumigimo","credit_id":"52fe49fac3a36847f81b0f53","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1604364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Hess","original_name":"Wolfgang Hess","popularity":0.1453,"profile_path":"/3MbTkQqmZqv6nrwvThO4d2G8dlg.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5cf28a04925141392ebac3b7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Gampl","original_name":"Christoph Gampl","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49fac3a36847f81b0f3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":867,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marc Meyer","original_name":"Marc Meyer","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf28a43c3a3682d1b206287","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52230,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ingo Ludwig Frenzel","original_name":"Ingo Ludwig Frenzel","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf28a6ec3a3684bf02132b1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150762,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexander Fischerkoesen","original_name":"Alexander Fischerkoesen","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/e936KZVavJOcR5X2M7qXXfCDrXC.jpg","credit_id":"5cf28aa4925141392ebac46e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1965164,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Markus Schmidt","original_name":"Markus Schmidt","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf28ab80e0a2679e4ccc671","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0321249","wikidata_id":"Q23565888","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1173,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pLwGsODdS9uJIwTp40RFrsSEkRd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":838}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2002-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
