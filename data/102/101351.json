Once again Shane McConkey, Miles Daisher, JT Holmes, and Australian Chris McDougal raise the bar that they alone have set. Ever see a Mister Bill, a jumper holding onto another jumper while the one jumper deploys? Maybe, but I bet you've never seen it done on a B.A.S.E jump, with one guy not wearing a parachute!!! Or how about a B.A.S.E. jump Mister Bill followed into a downplane? Sound scary, you bet it does. Ever see a single engine propeller plane with bent props and wonder how they got that way? Watch one of these guys and his \"perfect landing\".","popularity":0.0705,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keen N Able","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
