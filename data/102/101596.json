To a time when it would have been normal, even expected, for five Derry teenagers to get together and have a riot. The Undertones got together, formed a band and created their own form of riot, bursting into a vigorous and joyous celibration of their own existence.","popularity":0.3525,"poster_path":"/mD8V6kOfrK4tZh3wHW6ifoR1xzG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perfect Cousin Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of the Undertones - Teenage Kicks","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":215818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Peel","original_name":"John Peel","popularity":0.3019,"profile_path":"/o1piv4P3TNObX7Hr34jbxANr62I.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bbdc731925141379a02b4b6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1846218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eamonn McCann","original_name":"Eamonn McCann","popularity":0.1366,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bbdc73e0e0a26660302f832","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1226157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Feargal Sharkey","original_name":"Feargal Sharkey","popularity":0.0938,"profile_path":"/lmksrM6NtlPszBwWeLiouy0GZ3k.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bbdc7470e0a26660302f83e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110873,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tommy Collins","original_name":"Tommy Collins","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f4c3a36847f81af90d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110873,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tommy Collins","original_name":"Tommy Collins","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f4c3a36847f81af913","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":215818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Peel","original_name":"John Peel","popularity":0.3019,"profile_path":"/o1piv4P3TNObX7Hr34jbxANr62I.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49f4c3a36847f81af919","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0437506","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1255,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mD8V6kOfrK4tZh3wHW6ifoR1xzG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":838}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Story of THE UNDERTONES (2002)","key":"U0XCkrloumE","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2012-10-13T17:06:48.000Z","id":"61e041aba6fdaa001da0bd34"}]}}}
