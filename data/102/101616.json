That was also where he performed as Lucky Fonz III for the first time. He returns to the island for a performance at Into the Great Wide Open Festival. \"Lucky Fonz, that's just me without all the boring stuff and with the fun stuff in Technicolor. That's how I see it.\" This contemporary troubadour addresses the joy of singing and what fame means to him: \"Sometimes people ask me whether being famous has bothered me. I tell them I've actually been suffering from a lack of fame for the past 26 years.\"","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ballad of Lucky Fonz III","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1028273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Kleijwegt","original_name":"David Kleijwegt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f4c3a36847f81afa03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
