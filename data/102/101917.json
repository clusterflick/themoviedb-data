She excels at school, is good on the springboard and is careful too. Her severely handicapped brother Kasper gets a lot of attention. Merel also has talent for singing. It is no surprise that she is asked for the school musical. But maybe Merel is a bit too convinced of herself. When people perform solos, she likes to sing along loudly. This doesn't fall on good ground though. People start ignoring her and she is getting bullied. All of the sudden Merel's life isn't that easy anymore, it will be hard to keep herself together.","popularity":0.1663,"poster_path":"/w53RY8kSG2cmsEhOV1bO0vFLEBt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23946,"logo_path":"/nMSb08CGf7EPLaY6SDlOknlS9ZP.png","name":"NCRV","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":4588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Egmond Film & Television","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2004-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Merel, a talented young girl, is suddenly getting bullied at school.","title":"Bluebird","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elske Rotteveel","original_name":"Elske Rotteveel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"Merel de Leeuw","credit_id":"52fe49fdc3a36847f81b19cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kees Scholten","original_name":"Kees Scholten","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Kasper de Leeuw","credit_id":"52fe49fdc3a36847f81b19d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsie de Brauw","original_name":"Elsie de Brauw","popularity":0.1264,"profile_path":"/h24GWeSdM06XyrMxuuFyMOAY6WU.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Mrs. De Leeuw","credit_id":"52fe49fdc3a36847f81b19dd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaap Spijkers","original_name":"Jaap Spijkers","popularity":0.2075,"profile_path":"/thi1QOTdsGmUW13e6aXkQrQmDFs.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Mr. De Leeuw","credit_id":"52fe49fdc3a36847f81b19e1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mijke de Jong","original_name":"Mijke de Jong","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/zf7x6ciiUXIUZ6tQva33N2OSPcK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49fdc3a36847f81b19d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317619,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Barbara Westra","original_name":"Barbara Westra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d1a8a141eee1017c094194","department":"Art","job":"Set Dresser"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":27830,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Helena van der Meulen","original_name":"Helena van der Meulen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582e1375925141095a00cd3e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1057377,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ruben Impens","original_name":"Ruben Impens","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/4nxnyF23uGoSpoL2nvtw9BykZlv.jpg","credit_id":"5bbd0420925141378e01ead4","department":"Camera","job":"Focus Puller"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1816486,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Goert Giltay","original_name":"Goert Giltay","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673b3e60d28043e976e3defe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":228525,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dorith Vinken","original_name":"Dorith Vinken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673b3e652c0b7fd2034ac2dc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0159290","wikidata_id":"Q2583769","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":986,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/atFOPVD3AKSj16ImD1MJfIklf90.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1752}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/w53RY8kSG2cmsEhOV1bO0vFLEBt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
