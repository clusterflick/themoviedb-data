The triumphant West End production brought together Julie Walters (Mrs Overall), Celia Imrie (Miss Babs) and Duncan Preston (Mr Clifford) - the original cast of the series.  It was directed by Sir Trevor Nunn (\"Les Miserables\", \"Woman in White\", \"Starlight Express\") and written by Julie's understudy, the award-winning Victoria Wood.  Filmed during the sell-out run at the beautiful Haymarket Theatre, the musical features an all-star supporting cast of Josie Lawrence, Neil Morrissey & Sally Ann
