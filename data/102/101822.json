Liu Xiaodong is well-known for his monumental canvases, particularly those inspired by China's Three Gorges Dam project. Jia Zhangke visits Liu on the banks of Fengjie, a city about to be swallowed up by the Yangtze River. The area is in the process of being \"de-constructed\" by armies of shirtless male workers who form the subject of Liu's paintings. Liu and Jia next travel to Bangkok, where Liu paints Thai sex workers languishing in brothels. The two sets of paintings are united in their subjects' shared sense of malaise in the face of the dehumanizing labor afforded them.","popularity":0.1057,"poster_path":"/aR6GFnpWPP0yat7dd5Z6Z4Vnwpm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2006-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dong","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dong","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Xiaodong","original_name":"Liu Xiaodong","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49f9c3a36847f81b0dad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Han Sanming","original_name":"Han Sanming","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":"/tevFAVjAgNdjABsrJwhu0WNj5qF.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63a99276e4b57600ba0cb444","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jia Zhangke","original_name":"Jia Zhangke","popularity":0.5362,"profile_path":"/oMWMIBAjyAscFe3xlqJ5Qugg6yS.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49f9c3a36847f81b0db3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25471,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nelson Yu Lik-wai","original_name":"Nelson Yu Lik-wai","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/ewJrzbA5YwL9EwRu98R7XrJwfYq.jpg","credit_id":"589370e09251417ed7000776","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752519,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wang Yu","original_name":"Wang Yu","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5899516792514160a6000d59","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jia Zhangke","original_name":"Jia Zhangke","popularity":0.5362,"profile_path":"/oMWMIBAjyAscFe3xlqJ5Qugg6yS.jpg","credit_id":"664aded359b31045c65468a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jia Zhangke","original_name":"Jia Zhangke","popularity":0.5362,"profile_path":"/oMWMIBAjyAscFe3xlqJ5Qugg6yS.jpg","credit_id":"664ae89ae68b7c68cb79466f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0855784","wikidata_id":"Q787500","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jAFJ8XcXvtgrXGiQBclxmLUyOTq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":901,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/aR6GFnpWPP0yat7dd5Z6Z4Vnwpm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":635},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/5NWDojo18CyQD5WXA4Ijvx3feOj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hong Kong Asian Film Festival","release_date":"2006-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"San Diego Asian Film Festival; Icarus Films / dGenerate Films","release_date":"2020-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
