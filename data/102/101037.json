Then, we go to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial where we see and hear the Band play \"Aura Lee,\" \"Pack Up Your Troubles,\" and \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary.\" Band members also sing the latter songs, but \"Love Me Tender\" isn't a number one song yet, so \"Aura Lee\" just gets a musical treatment. The film concludes with \"Over There,\" played and sung, as we see news footage of the Army rolling in to Paris.","popularity":0.0613,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
