It does not matter that the Madrid-based singer, who is adored throughout the Spanish-speaking community, changed the locks to his house years ago. After the brain haemorrhage that hit him in 2001, Sabina suddenly could not bear the dozens of friends anymore that invaded his house. This was a raw deal for them, as the interviews reveal that director Ramón Gieling had with them. As in Gieling's previous documentaries, he created a cinematographic form for the interviews, which he consistently applies. Friends and former lovers are introduced in a minutely reconstructed copy of the living room they were expelled from. In the real living room, they used to lead a loose life without thinking about the health risks.","popularity":0.2624,"poster_path":"/ppVqD02nr63aNATb2zxLO7zDTi5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19962,"logo_path":"/ppbBv0isUhxiI1UABAn89lIUhn6.png","name":"Pieter van Huystee Film & TV","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2008-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joaquin Sabina - 19 Days and 500 Nights","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"19 Dagen en 500 Nachten","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Joaquín Sabina - 19 Dagen en 500 Nachten","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joaquín Sabina","original_name":"Joaquín Sabina","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/8CT1H6RSEQpRUpUI6RAREvh3Ua3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49f5c3a36847f81affad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Krahe","original_name":"Javier Krahe","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49f5c3a36847f81affb1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1031185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamín Prado","original_name":"Benjamín Prado","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/qtwDTU3oZHP184HCYrbbzVvUEas.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49f5c3a36847f81affb5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Román","original_name":"Olga Román","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe49f5c3a36847f81affb9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1031187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caco Senante","original_name":"Caco Senante","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/yqeQw9tyw0XmmUH9FiDxwv4mTKi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49f5c3a36847f81affbd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185251,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pieter van Huystee","original_name":"Pieter van Huystee","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5504abfa92514174b0001680","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ramón Gieling","original_name":"Ramón Gieling","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5504abeac3a3682529001689","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1177916","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1156,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ppVqD02nr63aNATb2zxLO7zDTi5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nederland 2","release_date":"2009-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
