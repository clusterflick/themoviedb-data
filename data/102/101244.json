Grown up in love and respect for the little ones, Mary, after leaving her home, soon sees the distortions of the patriarchal world surrounding her, starting with her husband's family. Here he reads the oldest brother of Joseph, Mordecai. The sunny and determined attitude of the girl, protective of children, arouses the indignation of the head of the family and those who are convinced of the need to give them punishment, discipline and submission.","popularity":0.7723,"poster_path":"/hyYNmZym7i5sZxL4fvkiUV9nT0V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95720,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magda
