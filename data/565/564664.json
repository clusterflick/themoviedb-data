Mohajers are asylum seekers, refugees, and other migrants in precarious situations and their camps are reception centers, detention centers, and temporary shelters. Camps are often located in remote areas, effectively isolating the individuals living in them. They are facilities for storing humans, full of invisible walls, and windows to remind people that the world they can see through them is out of their reach.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zy62KQuwLobme3LHZpndqzabWMD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Camp is a Wall in a Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2183606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Knappe","original_name":"Anna Knappe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bfbe5c4c3a36865bc00df14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2183607,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amir Jan","original_name":"Amir Jan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bfbe615925141108000edb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zy62KQuwLobme3LHZpndqzabWMD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
