Commuters boarded interim buses each day, waiting for the promise of of rapid service to be fulfilled. 15 years later the official replacement, The Silver Line, debuted. It was called Bus Rapid Transit but lacked much of the infrastructure to uphold the 'rapid' moniker. Equal or Better: The Story of the Silver Line explores the history of transportation equity in America through the lens of three communities in Boston. It unearths a story of environmental justice, race relations, and probes how we allocate tax-dollars in transportation in this nation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Equal or Better: The Story of the Silver Line","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2183828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kris Carter","original_name":"Kris Carter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bfc4abb9251411722016b0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2183828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kris Carter","original_name":"Kris Carter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bfc4ad39251411722016b3b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2136911","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
