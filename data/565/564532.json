A onetime member of San Francisco’s legendary Cockettes theatre troupe, Goldie was famously crowned Santa Monica College’s 1975 Homecoming Queen, captured in Bruce Yonemoto’s documentary HOMECOMING (1975). GARAGE SALE subverts the drag aspect of Goldie’s performance enabling her to sympathetically play a woman whose fantasies and expectations have been shaped by Hollywood romance films. The film follows the couple as Hero tries to regain Goldie’s love by seeking the advice of a cast of eccentric characters.","popularity":0.1658,"poster_path":"/xtnvuX0brzryF8O5ZEwCEtSKJ7V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Garage Sale","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Goldie Glitters","original_name":"Goldie Glitters","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":"/kvfsZ7dyJSUeOkO3sq7Idrs8z5B.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Goldie","credit_id":"5bfb1e5dc3a36869ae0018d8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2183338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom White","original_name":"Tom White","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Hero","credit_id":"5bfb1e7e0e0a26360e001895","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Hagopian","original_name":"Ruth Hagopian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Weiner Wrap Waitress","credit_id":"6238b3468ec4ab0077d982c3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2590452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Opel","original_name":"Robert Opel","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6238b3b18ac3d000442f9fe7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1407074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Yonemoto","original_name":"Bruce Yonemoto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bfb1ee39251411329001782","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2119934,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nick Elliot","original_name":"Nick Elliot","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bfb1ea892514116540018de","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1154811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman Yonemoto","original_name":"Norman Yonemoto","popularity":1.22,"profile_path":"/jD3I91Y7TiA3t2PA9OIJeK0QGBM.jpg","credit_id":"5bfb58760e0a263888005583","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1154811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman Yonemoto","original_name":"Norman Yonemoto","popularity":1.22,"profile_path":"/jD3I91Y7TiA3t2PA9OIJeK0QGBM.jpg","credit_id":"5bfb58820e0a26388800558d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1154811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman Yonemoto","original_name":"Norman Yonemoto","popularity":1.22,"profile_path":"/jD3I91Y7TiA3t2PA9OIJeK0QGBM.jpg","credit_id":"5bfb5892c3a3686476006344","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0158630","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xtnvuX0brzryF8O5ZEwCEtSKJ7V.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uaoJbiY1H8d8ttivzjJ8CdVsnXD.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1976-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
