Where Deslaw negativized, I negate —while recovering the original positive images—, drastically reducing the film’s 60 minutes’ length and reversing the images in space and time.  I kept the same soundtrack, although equally compressed into 3 minutes’ length and divided into two channels: one, in the original direction; the other one, reversed.  This negation of a negation is far from being an acceptation: the folk images and songs from a fascist country, underlying the NO-DO shots touched up by Deslaw, are negated; the filmmaker’s intentions when negativizing/negating them are understood; but, seeing that the effort is not enough, this film goes beyond his proposal on the way to total destruction. - Alberte Pagán","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walsed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1748136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberte Pagán","original_name":"Alberte Pagán","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bfae31ec3a36813ab02c24a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
