Born during the Civil War, she fought during the Second World War where she survived three concentration camps. After the war, she worked as a pediatrician for 50 years. On the screen, Ida Frank's monologue is an autobiographical tale that speaks of her life, of choice even when there seems to be none. It is a rare blend of sincerity and agreed language, deeply personal, objective and uncompromising. The story of this woman combines the optimism of youth, the spirit, self-deprecation and a fighting character, all forming a powerful agreement.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/hrrIdnK1GPjFMj8Es4hXxDn0d4C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When The Morning Came","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Kogda nastupilo utro","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1593116,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dmitry Vorobyov","original_name":"Дмитрий Воробьёв","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a5bdfd5a9915013a232112","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2181714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Zavin","original_name":"Alexandr Zavin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/hTVBA5WYc75J9BzB4Ah4s10wDx9.jpg","credit_id":"5bf851fd9251415cc10f05c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2181714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Zavin","original_name":"Alexandr Zavin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/hTVBA5WYc75J9BzB4Ah4s10wDx9.jpg","credit_id":"5bf8524fc3a36818a50f8670","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2181714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Zavin","original_name":"Alexandr Zavin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/hTVBA5WYc75J9BzB4Ah4s10wDx9.jpg","credit_id":"5bf852530e0a264f6e096022","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2181714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Zavin","original_name":"Alexandr Zavin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/hTVBA5WYc75J9BzB4Ah4s10wDx9.jpg","credit_id":"5bf852590e0a26266f0fc77a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9g8EWOeaN7y6APlBtF0OmkQaq8x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aad4fGPtOGtDpxpiXOHuxPBXSqL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qKmCvlSOnBex8aY2UukpLPgeblL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.733,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hrrIdnK1GPjFMj8Es4hXxDn0d4C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"International Film Festival on Human Rights \"Stalker\"","release_date":"2017-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
