He passed through four death camps and on 8 February 1945 he escaped from the Usedom Island concentration camp aboard a Heinkel 111 bomber with 9 Soviet suicide bombers. Usedom Island was home to the highly secret German missile center in Peenemünde, where the world's only V-2 ballistic rocket was tested, the weapon of revenge, as Hitler called them. Historians have described as miraculous the fact that the Heinkel 111, which Mikhail Devyataev assimilated the controls practically in the air, could not be shot down by the German fighters sent in alarm.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":"/lQuNK2ssnXB64dXoXIp1Btl28EP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Escape From Usedom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Pobeg s Uzedoma","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2182533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Kasyanov","original_name":"Alexandr Kasyanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lys7xjjUJvPXzvcBpttGip0Gjya.jpg","credit_id":"5bf994a792514104be0167f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2182538,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Natalya Kim","original_name":"Natalya Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf9953d92514104be01688f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2039462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Nepevny","original_name":"Vladimir Nepevny","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/cs1rpPvzzn1KcoIX3IGcpZDiCEO.jpg","credit_id":"5bf9955dc3a368138c01689b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2182542,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrey Gral","original_name":"Andrey Gral","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf995d80e0a263ab601876c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2182544,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexey Matrosov","original_name":"Alexey Matrosov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf9961a0e0a263ab80189f0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2182545,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Artem Iosilevich","original_name":"Artem Iosilevich","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf99669c3a36813a60181f1","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2182548,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Choub","original_name":"Alex Choub","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf996c80e0a263ab1018fab","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2182549,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Igor Kabanov","original_name":"Igor Kabanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf99712c3a368138c01715b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2182550,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vladimir Repin","original_name":"Vladimir Repin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/aSHQQRmm1lw5cllVadFUzgl8r8y.jpg","credit_id":"5bf9974992514104d201677f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2182541,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Natalya Prygina","original_name":"Natalya Prygina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf998bf92514104d2016957","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2182540,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tatyana Skvortsova","original_name":"Tatyana Skvortsova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf998d692514104c4016ee9","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2182533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Kasyanov","original_name":"Alexandr Kasyanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lys7xjjUJvPXzvcBpttGip0Gjya.jpg","credit_id":"5bf998e992514104cc01617b","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m2FZgANA5Qqf0y24r3MWJ3ra98j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/lQuNK2ssnXB64dXoXIp1Btl28EP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":711}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
