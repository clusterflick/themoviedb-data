It was so cold that the camera would barely turn, until the sun came up. The film is a very modest record of a moment in a place, with camera-movement making reference to the passage of days. Tholos is a film of a Mycenaean tomb at Nichoria in Messenia, Greece. Jasmine Tea unknowingly reprised a project given to students at at least one university, when they are short of ideas: make a film of a cup of tea! Garden examines an area of my garden, which can be sombre or joyful. Starting with minutiae, the film works its way outwards.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/52W830xL4EuR576Zin1ooROuydC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Little Films: Frost Table, Tholos, Jasmine Tea, and Garden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":152070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Collins","original_name":"Nick Collins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/e7P9hXgAzxihpQucodPiTqtzfVk.jpg","credit_id":"5bfb1018c3a36869ae000b91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1074,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/52W830xL4EuR576Zin1ooROuydC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":713}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
