Incredibly, soon after his accident, Billy resolved to get back to racing, in the hope of becoming the first ever amputee to race competitively in a single-seater racing car.  This film follows the extraordinary story of Billy and his family, as he pursues his dream to one day race in Formula One. With the support of the racing community and his hero Lewis Hamilton, Billy has to change the rules of motorsport and learn to drive again without legs, all while coming to terms with life as a disabled person - a term Billy is reluctant to accept. This heartwarming and inspirational story is about the incredible will of one young man, but also the extraordinary support his family provides during the toughest time of their lives.","popularity":1.0344,"poster_path":"/riE6K4pEkzpZkhP7WKSYAjXRYhX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Driven: The Billy Monger Story","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4253200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Monger","original_name":"Billy Monger","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"653576d82b2108013f5adcef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lewis Hamilton","original_name":"Lewis Hamilton","popularity":0.6259,"profile_path":"/xstxLSZAjVY3RbLW19I44bD5eE8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"653576e291f0ea00ac5d8660","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4253203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonny Monger","original_name":"Bonny Monger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"653576f6abdafc012da97bd2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2194269,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Steve Rider","original_name":"Steve Rider","popularity":0.1547,"profile_path":"/wtDYuwQapvqhHHWvjsnwPiBVQn1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6535770242d83700eac63098","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1225263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Silverton","original_name":"Kate Silverton","popularity":0.1866,"profile_path":"/yS0w17KzIP6YH1HGQZANkKJDNw7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (Archive)","credit_id":"6535771302842000c59bda18","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlie Russell","original_name":"Charlie Russell","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6244c7ffdfe31d005bceef6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9310456","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vEV4yirbYDXtIFHdbQtxzmHcG0K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTiRAgChtYzf19mGwFGiUzC55uW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/riE6K4pEkzpZkhP7WKSYAjXRYhX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":2492,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q6NqgqZSywHPIpaPUfWEUrCPVvD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1670}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14541,"name":"crash"},{"id":238380,"name":"racing driver"},{"id":242128,"name":"motorsport"},{"id":245776,"name":"disabled person"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
