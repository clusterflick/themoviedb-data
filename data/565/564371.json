The film reflects this effervescence, giving voice to the artists, curators, and audience, but also offers a unique approach to an exhibition in progress. We watch Sol LeWitt constructing Three-Part Variations; Joseph Beuys installing Raumplastik; Martial Raysse talking about the role of the artist; Harald Szeemann defending the concept of the museum; and Edward Kienholz explaining his work from inside his Roxys installation, among many others.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Documenta 4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2154519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jef Cornelis","original_name":"Jef Cornelis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bfa67200e0a263ab6027004","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
