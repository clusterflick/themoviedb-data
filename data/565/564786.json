While Henri is not excessively upset about the divorce, he is sad, hates to be alone, and dislikes the sorts of wrenching changes that are being forced on him. Indeed, his ex-wife cannot get him to leave their shared quarters by the court deadline without having a terrific row with him. When he finally leaves, he leans a great deal on his 10-year-old daughter for company, comfort and support. She gets used to that and has to make adjustments when Henri gets a new woman in his life.","popularity":0.2098,"poster_path":"/l5uh2CUvjwTc9pa4AJaFZIF7JTW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1742,"logo_path":"/kxKBr4UuwuVdMhuunZ579vWd5in.png","name":"Les Films
