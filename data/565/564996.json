René Vautier, with ZAPU (Zimbabwe African Party for Unity), denounces this killing. Expelled by the Rhodesian police (informed by the French secret services), the filmmaker shoots a film in Algeria in the form of an indictment against colonial savagery. The film was first banned in France, then authorized in 1965.","popularity":0.279,"poster_path":"/mCF3vgmXzO6jdkLqWWcn6SNorcP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161249,"logo_path":"/11E2GqLEZTo9y7GLgjROZ1134vV.png","name":"René Vautier","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZW","name":"Zimbabwe"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Death Knell","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079380,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Djibril Diop Mambéty","original_name":"Djibril Diop Mambéty","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/qP0a19xyKBoAY22ZsnJJy9Okfm6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5bfd968e0e0a2636ce033a6f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3443326,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ali Marok","original_name":"Ali Marok","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4exJRpCC1JZSPRltO8JBFBVc5xo.jpg","credit_id":"65c7d8be54a0980184020ad9","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Vautier","original_name":"René Vautier","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/aN9ghcXiG4z0OtF8QKfbLzPwd3v.jpg","credit_id":"65c7e53ae295b40162f82aae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079380,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Djibril Diop Mambéty","original_name":"Djibril Diop Mambéty","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/qP0a19xyKBoAY22ZsnJJy9Okfm6.jpg","credit_id":"65c7e53f8d77c4017b45a3f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Vautier","original_name":"René Vautier","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/aN9ghcXiG4z0OtF8QKfbLzPwd3v.jpg","credit_id":"65c836d3aad9c20164b69308","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Vautier","original_name":"René Vautier","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/aN9ghcXiG4z0OtF8QKfbLzPwd3v.jpg","credit_id":"5bfd9601c3a3685a4b02e205","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11368960","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yA81TqFg7FN7Ibx7N0qjFD0R0xs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mCF3vgmXzO6jdkLqWWcn6SNorcP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oyHGGPtUDFjs27FW6IqWYcRKET.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/phdGWKdiv44cioU0AKuyMN9RD9Y.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oTFWzwmsfXcXzFX6BDkyrw9EfUU.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187024,"name":"british colonialism"},{"id":195395,"name":"zimbabwe"},{"id":262858,"name":"anti-colonialism"},{"id":293298,"name":"panafricanism"},{"id":296484,"name":"algerian cinema"},{"id":317466,"name":"anti-imperialism"},{"id":328171,"name":"cinema guerilla"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
