Pancini, a Staten Island electrician, and others such as Frank Seddio, an Assemblyman in Canarsie, Brooklyn, compete to have the biggest, brightest, most over-the-top Christmas house in New York City. This short documentary shows what motivates these men and what it takes for them to pull it off bigger and flashier every year--despite the sometime objections of angry neighbors.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/uSJoDm44ctuOQn2bHqewtG6maLx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kings of Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0449483","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1075,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uSJoDm44ctuOQn2bHqewtG6maLx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
