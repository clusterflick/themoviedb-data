Up to 4 screens and 4 channels of multi-layered music immerse the audience in colorful rhythmic molecular forms, morphing frequencies and visual textures, which are broken down to the particle. Found images from the 20th century educational films are sewn together with melted down pharmaceuticals affixed directly to the film, and form a concentrated fusion with pulsating electronic sounds and an acoustic multi-tonal bass clarinet. Illustrations of brain dendrites, synapses, waveforms and assembly lines personify the movement of frequencies and light as they envelop the audience. As the performance ensues, the intensity builds to a point of irresistible danger and rupture.","popularity":0.2431,"poster_path":"/a92lwypRZo2dNNgbYmXGIuSuMnM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31031,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sparky Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light Work Mood Disorder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1083125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Reeves","original_name":"Jennifer Reeves","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/lQD4P4GzHaAtMhO2yPJmgDASjE8.jpg","credit_id":"5bf9b30c92514104c1018ec5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0968291","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":996,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a92lwypRZo2dNNgbYmXGIuSuMnM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":664}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220286,"name":"scratch film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
