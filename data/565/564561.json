His father, perhaps unhinged by the death of his wife, beats and torments him almost constantly. His older brother, instead of protecting him, keeps watch over him for the father. His best friend, a homosexual, is in love with him, but the boy is in love with the best friend's sister. When the best friend catches the two in bed together, all hell breaks loose.","popularity":0.0462,"poster_path":"/4OnKAkTSf3lfVajBn417lvokndj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4496,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Number One","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1971-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Whip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Forget","original_name":"Pierre Forget","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":"/pxUCVqZ9ELoklYIZyhZdlX2l6N9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The father","credit_id":"61c76324f5f1c50061b5f4f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3358296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gil de Lesparda","original_name":"Gil de Lesparda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Thierry","credit_id":"61c76328bb105700a077e98b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3358297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Laigre","original_name":"Richard Laigre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Alain","credit_id":"61c76335f5f1c5001af0764b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1525459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Parent","original_name":"Jacqueline Parent","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":"/sKrAKYzd9huta3nBvm3IOatCvYW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Yvette","credit_id":"61c76339b04228001c7cdccb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3358298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Salesses","original_name":"Richard Salesses","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jean-François","credit_id":"61c76342d861af005ee64a32","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3358299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulette Revel","original_name":"Paulette Revel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Vonnas","credit_id":"61c7634ac15f89001c018e59","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39153,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pierre Kalfon","original_name":"Pierre Kalfon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bfb3966c3a36865dc0028b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0259949","wikidata_id":"Q56314018","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1062,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4OnKAkTSf3lfVajBn417lvokndj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":708}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bourg-en-Bresse","release_date":"1971-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
