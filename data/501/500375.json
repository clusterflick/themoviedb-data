A picturesque travelogue takes a creepy turn in this delightfully kitsch look at famous haunted castles across England, directed by Michael Winner. Filmed in beautiful Eastmancolor, this fun, spooky short sees Anne Boleyn trailing the gardens of Norfolk's Blickley Hall, while Wild Lord Edric, betrayed by William the Conqueror, roams the Stiperstones. Elsewhere, Lord Bath welcomes a clairvoyant to investigate Longleat's Grey Lady.","popularity":0.5606,"poster_path":"/2Zncsw7iGQase8PJB5ReJsWLYaY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18039,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scimitar
