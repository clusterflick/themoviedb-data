The film highlights how these cultural and stereotypical images of Ireland as a woman influence the idealised model of woman demanded by Irish society. It uses historical film, photographs, political drawings, cartoons and music to explore the largely unrecorded role of women in Irish history and presents realistic images of Irish women at work today.","popularity":0.0698,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother Ireland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1468920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernadette Devlin","original_name":"Bernadette Devlin","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/8pU6OzeYfYjrNEz2G6ci2GNx2Nk.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"641fb8fe2dc9dc007c0617e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat Murphy","original_name":"Pat Murphy","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/k4DjnVDouoH2LqAhWbUuEW9Rul7.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"641fb90a53466100f0eba13d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1240911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nell McCafferty","original_name":"Nell McCafferty","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"641fb9362dc9dc007c061809","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966323,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mike Shirra","original_name":"Mike Shirra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a68be65c3a3685a7d0007f7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966327,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jim Curran","original_name":"Jim Curran","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a68bfa80e0a260d74000b4f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Crilly","original_name":"Anne Crilly","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a68be2d0e0a260d670008d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966332,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brendan McMenamin","original_name":"Brendan McMenamin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a68bfe60e0a260d78000b74","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephanie English","original_name":"Stephanie English","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a68bfb3c3a3685a76000a6a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792946,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margo Harkin","original_name":"Margo Harkin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a68bfbdc3a3685aa8000a8f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Crilly","original_name":"Anne Crilly","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a68bfa10e0a260d74000b3c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966329,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tomas MacCoilin","original_name":"Tomas MacCoilin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a68bfce0e0a260d64000c06","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966331,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerardine McGuinness","original_name":"Gerardine McGuinness","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a68bfdc0e0a260d7b000ad4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0192331","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
