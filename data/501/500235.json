While the Germans advance inexorably on the French territory, the army is in full debacle. While the top brass played \"sauve qui peut\", a handful of French soldiers desperately resisted on the banks of the Loire. On one side, a company of Senegalese riflemen and a few French soldiers, on the other side, the armored tanks of the Wehrmarcht. An act with no real future, it was considered heroic by some and useless by others. But for their leader, Henri Dragance, there was no alternative but to resist or die.","popularity":0.0905,"poster_path":"/7E4FejfxPc3PTuIaQglhheRBdTO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11331,"logo_path":"/wcHhcw58wms26ejFLx1unYDT37n.png","name":"Cinétévé","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11359,"logo_path":"/aqWJRi66t2oMPMmC60CdK9I3WQd.png","name":"France
