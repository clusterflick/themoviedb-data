Ready to embrace his traveling experience, he misses his train and finds himself in a small village region. Viewed by the villagers as 'an eccentric in a white Stetson', he finds himself settling into an unfamiliar world of very strange people. Here the people really do drown newly-born puppies, eat the fish they catch in the river and even smack their children. But it only takes a few days before Joe begins to understand the villagers and, after accepting them into his heart, he falls in love with Liza, a beautiful local girl.","popularity":0.1217,"poster_path":"/1y517IK2ddGRPxpnNBe1hXm7V0H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16079,"logo_path":"/6BF18oLINXIs1FZCZBAV1JOJx5h.png","name":"Star Media","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2013-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poor Liz","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Bednaya Liz","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":568728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masha Mashkova","original_name":"Мария Машкова","popularity":0.4498,"profile_path":"/akv5uUaBnS8KkqsM91aHx1HtlYd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Liza","credit_id":"5a6518990e0a261a0102e854","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Pampushniy","original_name":"Anton Pampushniy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Joe Sokoloff","credit_id":"5a6518ab0e0a261a0102e866","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niele Serezhnikova","original_name":"Niele Serezhnikova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Olya","credit_id":"5a6518c60e0a261a0402f881","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1688977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleksandr Danylchenko","original_name":"Олександр Данильченко","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":"/xwMlmFJU1h8U7MxZFIw0IZcYS7d.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Grandy Grisha","credit_id":"5a6518ebc3a3687fad02c73c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":236001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksey Lisovets","original_name":"Aleksey Lisovets","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6518499251410b1c02d755","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3526970","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mjaijLfI9ZWqjwu8JyJJSD4kCRv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":849,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1y517IK2ddGRPxpnNBe1hXm7V0H.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
