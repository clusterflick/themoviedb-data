The heaviness of a broken relationship with his father, and losing the identity of \"football star\" push him to seek a new way to prove himself. Restricted from playing any sports and despite being an unlikely runner, the cross country coach brings the young man aboard his high school team out of necessity, and through much struggle, doubt, and determination, he finds a new way to push towards greatness.  With colorful characters, youthful insights, and nostalgic storytelling, \"The Rocket\" brings together the elements of family, loss, failure, and redemption. The entire story is based on real characters and events that took place in the mid-west in 1999.","popularity":0.3176,"poster_path":"/RODAohboSiIGcjUmDd0laMcLuB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rocket","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brady Tutton","original_name":"Brady Tutton","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/eFbh00Y2qJDclpxK96aLOSNpeD0.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Joshua Davis","credit_id":"5a6751e80e0a26194500dc65","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":78327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Blake","original_name":"Richard Blake","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":"/hf0KkywUfyp07UCJGABubsbV95s.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Coach Keith Olsen","credit_id":"5a67525c0e0a26194800e6dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allison Belmont","original_name":"Allison Belmont","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/8opoGT7hjLUPMEIywAKYoGloIQn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sophie Kerkman","credit_id":"5a6752dc0e0a26194200ddfb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Mayfield","original_name":"Michael Mayfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cV46yS5WnzCMLM24oryJDpLY9vm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Terry","credit_id":"5a6752f00e0a26194b00e473","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leah Schiman","original_name":"Leah Schiman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9If2PYLo35PnWFpJBdgodzZCysg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Caitlin Moore","credit_id":"5a675319c3a3680cea00c7d9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1829799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nickolaus Schnetzky","original_name":"Nickolaus Schnetzky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/h8nJKIXAqOuR3yo3yQkUJS82i67.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Young Josh Davis","credit_id":"5a67533d0e0a26195700ddd8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Webb","original_name":"Patrick Webb","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":"/7HA9PSvXmeaX0sioZykKkrP8moK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kyle","credit_id":"5a6753600e0a26195700ddf4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grayson Alexander Miller","original_name":"Grayson Alexander Miller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/utBCGL9vzru5yXegqxm8xR7wonE.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Shane Daney","credit_id":"5a67580a0e0a26194500e27d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2661524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry King","original_name":"Terry King","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Race Announcer / Representative","credit_id":"665d0a78e6bce7ccd6ab1b69","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":78327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Blake","original_name":"Richard Blake","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":"/hf0KkywUfyp07UCJGABubsbV95s.jpg","credit_id":"5a6758bac3a3680cfb00e81a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":78327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Blake","original_name":"Richard Blake","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":"/hf0KkywUfyp07UCJGABubsbV95s.jpg","credit_id":"5a6758aac3a3680cf900de38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5181834","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vFexiCtPXEkwzrgBLX3W6Av8xh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.693,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/slAvX44Uky8jSbjPQuQJalfbIWR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":693},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/RODAohboSiIGcjUmDd0laMcLuB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
