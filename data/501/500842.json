Both consider themselves to be writers, but success has so far eluded them. The fact that Wu is supported by a divorced, elderly man helps the women through lean periods.

The situation escalates when both Wu and her mother hit an emotional low.","popularity":0.1223,"poster_path":"/pcDo7X14ivLfPicT1p3in7wcLi2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2018-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girls Always Happy","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Rou qing shi: Girls Always Happy","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71060,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nai An","original_name":"Nai An","popularity":0.1258,"profile_path":"/fnb9EN2MhjmZH7eR06xmkmHRWel.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"5bb6f3fd0e0a26339301f032","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1511081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yang Mingming","original_name":"Yang Mingming","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/4vXAmhfH80BvzxSpQjiFmub0402.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wu","credit_id":"5bb6f40c0e0a26338b021249","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhang Xianmin","original_name":"Zhang Xianmin","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":"/dktKG32HPTME2Q9rmN2BL592GeB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Zhangxian","credit_id":"5bb6f457c3a368151d0199e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1297751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Qinqin","original_name":"李勤勤","popularity":0.1785,"profile_path":"/jJVuOs1Gz3KZlblPTwoaNVjT0PA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Zhuyuan","credit_id":"5bb6f48f0e0a2633a701e8a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2567120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wenbo Li","original_name":"Li Wenbo","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bao Gang","credit_id":"625e7bea229ae232170f3e1a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5040345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Yuan","original_name":"Li Yuan","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Yushan","credit_id":"6728c571008c8137852e00a8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1511081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yang Mingming","original_name":"Yang Mingming","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/4vXAmhfH80BvzxSpQjiFmub0402.jpg","credit_id":"607994ebfb8346005794f6ae","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1511081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yang Mingming","original_name":"Yang Mingming","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/4vXAmhfH80BvzxSpQjiFmub0402.jpg","credit_id":"5a6a143f0e0a26435600132a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1511081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yang Mingming","original_name":"Yang Mingming","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/4vXAmhfH80BvzxSpQjiFmub0402.jpg","credit_id":"5bb6f4c69251410dd1020963","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7955712","wikidata_id":"Q48965000","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":1231,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/pcDo7X14ivLfPicT1p3in7wcLi2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":814}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":240315,"name":"mother daughter relationship"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Hong Kong International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Icarus Films / dGenerate Films","release_date":"2018-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
