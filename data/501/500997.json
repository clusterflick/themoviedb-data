It's a film essay about the artist’s work, rather than a documentary about his life. An unmediated vision of Jack Smith, an invitation to join him in his lost paradise.","popularity":0.269,"poster_path":"/vOfgtooduV6cLYz3tsp9z3Glghy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
