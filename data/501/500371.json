Telling tales from a grand menu of culinary temples as well as digging into the greatness and flaws of Guide Michelin in this golden age of gastronomy. Because we share a great love for the industry that also includes a realistic understanding of things behind the picturesque scenes of the--perhaps--greatest, most creative and dynamic industry in the world.","popularity":0.1331,"poster_path":"/sDV9Se6BjCpaWrAaGTJPoPXrX2E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2017-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Michelin Stars: Tales from the Kitchen","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rasmus Dinesen","original_name":"Rasmus Dinesen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/lLA93Sk88dbqBktU9LorgCvNdf9.jpg","credit_id":"5a66da3292514169bb00628e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7368162","wikidata_id":"Q76450294","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r7pRaHzs2BawjbgRSL0UfP9QW9Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sDV9Se6BjCpaWrAaGTJPoPXrX2E.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pJStaELlCIxuS9MSUlFIMhJOezS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706},{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":1099,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/ybfb1JIGxkhqng8kGLI0wk06K2g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Sebastian Film Festival","release_date":"2017-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"N-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"2018 IFF Kino pavasaris","release_date":"2018-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
