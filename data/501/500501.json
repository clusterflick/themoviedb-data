Reflecting on childhood hopes for the adults we thought we’d become, and sticking a joyful middle finger up at depression in the process, Rachel’s deft moves between jazz riffs, musical theatre, and the perfect response to that Flight of the Concords song, will have you tapping your feet as you laugh through the tears. Named The Independent’s ‘One to Watch’, Chortle award nominee Rachel’s songs are regularly played on BBC Radio 4 and BBC 6 Music. All together now: “No house, no husband, no child, no wage?
