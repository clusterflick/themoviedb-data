It is a lyrical and sometimes hilarious film essay on the “old Europe”, experienced by travellers and observers, of times when people used to wander, share a joke, pause and, sometimes, even stop.  Shot on Super 8 mm, the film takes us to Paris, Venice, London, Madrid and Dublin; Iceland, Ireland and Corsica.","popularity":0.0797,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2004-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tove and Tooti in Europe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":226361,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tove Jansson","original_name":"Tove Jansson","popularity":0.2094,"profile_path":"/uFQHx602Gst9cpY1wvWmh2ywvQM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a670b8c92514169c7008e20","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tuulikki Pietilä","original_name":"Tuulikki Pietilä","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zdNqRZyystF6CsA4OMXG1BDHbvO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a670b9a92514169be0094f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1965759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivica Bandler","original_name":"Vivica Bandler","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a670baac3a3680d13009473","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kanerva Cederström","original_name":"Kanerva Cederström","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a670b560e0a26194b009af9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Riikka Tanner","original_name":"Riikka Tanner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a670b600e0a2619420096fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tuulikki Pietilä","original_name":"Tuulikki Pietilä","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zdNqRZyystF6CsA4OMXG1BDHbvO.jpg","credit_id":"5a670b720e0a26195b0095ae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0457172","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
