Félix Lamarche contemplates it, cozies up to it and sings its praises in this sensory short that’s as much poetry as it is science. The film alternates between archival footage and new material filmed aboard the marine research vessel Coriolis II as it explores the part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence where Quebec and Newfoundland meet. By focusing on this border and its basket of conflicting environmental and economic issues, the filmmaker takes us on a philosophical walk in the bracing coastal air – insisting that the ocean finally be valued fully and properly.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/juKPA8fvTLmAbSdACKoKXfK9ugM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La frontière","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1965066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Félix Lamarche","original_name":"Félix Lamarche","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hixJKlr4S3WuAuwmlMEnAja23lw.jpg","credit_id":"5a653e4d0e0a2619f20302a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q53468690","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2wZAgSIx2VhZP7ET4lh97WqnLrp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1875,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/juKPA8fvTLmAbSdACKoKXfK9ugM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1250},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/etHgbK9boYu1QjLDoURpNDvlmPb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
