The end of the GDR gave rise to new artistic freedoms in reunited Berlin. Shortly after the fall of the Wall, rebel director Frank Castorf was appointed artistic director of the Volksbühne. His way of working altered the public’s perception of this theater. The chronological history of the Castorf era between 1992 and 2017 is told here in excerpts from the productions and in a series of conversations conducted on the long sofa in the theater's foyer.","popularity":0.3203,"poster_path":"/sJN9ldQtQ2klLVj8iVfVwZpVcvU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solo Film Company
