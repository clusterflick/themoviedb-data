She swore that she would never remove the cloth over her eyes until her dead were avenged by the deaths of the patrón and his daughter. Nature seems to be on her side, since a drought has afflicted the land. Her other son, Malambo, accepts the duty of revenge. Malambo is no normal human: he is the runa-uturungo, or Hombre Tigre, of Quechua lore, and he cannot be wounded by bullets. He leads the obreros to rise in revolt and defeats the patrón. However, instead of killing the patrón's daughter--the blind Urpila --he falls in love with her, thereby breaking his mother's heart.","popularity":0.2141,"poster_path":"/yD0fzxnQoRaEgbUxPvHdbKJU2JV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92090,"logo_path":null,"name":"Establecimientos Filmadores
