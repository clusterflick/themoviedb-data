Every four years new heroes emerge, legends are born, amidst the drama, excitement and passion of the beautiful game.  But for every Pele, there’s a Graham Poll. For every Michael Owen wonder goal, there’s a woeful own goal. The Tartan Army in tatters and England losing any penalty shoot-out that matters. Controversies and calamities that tantalise and torment in equal measure.  John Motson, the game’s most loved and respected commentator takes a trip to the home of football, the venue for England’s greatest ever triumph - Wembley Stadium - to introduce these unforgettable moments of magic and madness from World Cup history.  From Moore to Maradona, and Zico to Zidane, from yellow cards to red mist, and ifs and buts to head butts, Motty guides us through an incredible journey of tickertape, tantrums, triumphs and tears.  The ultimate World Cup Heroes and Villains.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/53tYct7HAf53oX1Q1lM6ArmvUTe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Motson's World cup heroes and villains","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/53tYct7HAf53oX1Q1lM6ArmvUTe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1060}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
