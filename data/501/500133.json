White smoke rises from the holes, curling around the charcoal burner to the whims of the wind before it is carried off into the dark of night. In calm, stunning images, the documentary “Köhlernächte” by Robert Müller draws the viewer into the archaic world of commercial charcoal burning in Switzerland’s Napf region.","popularity":0.1989,"poster_path":"/dI5oYw6eKAcdJBy0HmNwE2EfHTf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeitraum Film","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2018-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pure Charcoal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Pure Charcoal","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1964988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Müller","original_name":"Robert Müller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6510520e0a261a0102e124","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":73792,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kathrin Plüss","original_name":"Kathrin Plüss","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6510959251410b2102b71d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69931,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pio Corradi","original_name":"Pio Corradi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6510670e0a2619f802e4dd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t0FXqro6aEK2Qb4w1c8RFT4Tb4e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/dI5oYw6eKAcdJBy0HmNwE2EfHTf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1358}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"KÖHLERNÄCHTE (Official trailer, Dialekt Schweizerdeutsch)","key":"dKe0ziM_eWY","published_at":"2017-11-15T08:52:08.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"5a65119c9251410b1a02c046"}]}}}
