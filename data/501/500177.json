But to others, it’s a limitless world of fun, freedom and opportunity where life can be lived to the full. A new documentary presented by Patagonia and directed by Keith Malloy, Fishpeople tells the stories of a unique cast of characters who have dedicated their lives to the sea. From surfers and spearfishers to a long-distance swimmer, a former coal miner and a group of at-risk kids, it’s a film about the transformative effects of time spent in the ocean—and how we can leave our limitations behind to find deeper meaning in the saltwater wilderness that lies just beyond the shore.","popularity":0.2192,"poster_path":"/2WCzOvb3EcbNtSHtDE5vP6tATgE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148014,"logo_path":"/sh5M67BZcLtrMkyX6sXTcg4ci2z.png","name":"Patagonia","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United
