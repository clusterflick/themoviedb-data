The Institute, founded in 1967 with close ties to The Museum of Modern Art, made New York the global center for architectural debate and redefined architectural discourse in the United States. A place of immense energy and effervescence, its founders and participants were young and hardly known at the time but would ultimately become some of the most influential figures in the field shaping architectural practice and theory for decades. The Institute became the most significant and energetic crossroad in the path of rethinking architecture and the city and it's influence is still felt today.","popularity":0.2699,"poster_path":"/8FHaxQrZiw6ETa0VSGkhjoTTnM1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diana Agrest Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Making of an Avant-Garde: The Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies 1967-1984","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Wigley","original_name":"Mark Wigley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbc33a6271ca500414ff0cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1818221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Eisenman","original_name":"Peter Eisenman","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbc33c9aa659e003b992f03","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1106998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rem Koolhaas","original_name":"Rem Koolhaas","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbc33fa9c97bd003d9cfbb3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Gehry","original_name":"Frank Gehry","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbc34119c97bd003e9cec25","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2863302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Agrest","original_name":"Diana Agrest","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbc34442dc9dc00433bb6b5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Gandelsonas","original_name":"Mario Gandelsonas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbc3464263462003d0d7d83","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Meier","original_name":"Richard Meier","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbc33e6175051003f0df4c7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Frampton","original_name":"Kenneth Frampton","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbc347b8b959e003e46729d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Jakobsen","original_name":"Barbara Jakobsen","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":39,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbc4c2f8b959e003d468d84","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Berke","original_name":"Deborah Berke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":40,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbc4c44071650003d88dcc8","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Vidler","original_name":"Anthony Vidler","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":41,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbc4c54263462003b0d8e6b","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert A.M.
