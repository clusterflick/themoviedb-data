Monotony of action inclines to multitude of associations: myth about Sisyphus;  Frieda of Bulgakov, who is constantly offered a handkerchief; grown-up daughter  of Stalker, roaming in the Zone which gives neither fulfillment of desires,  nor relief. The authors slowly immerse viewers into multilayered space, where surrounding reality is dissolving, and so is human sight, which rediscovers  itself on the border in searches of initial static point.  Such creative exercises can also be marked by rather expected desire to arrange knowledge and understanding of cinematograph in contemporary context of visual communication and conversion of created work into completely different,  unexplored quality of the art.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/nrmxwFeDHifIhE5eQodqphHlVk6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2011-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Eternity is a child playing… (Heracletus of Ephesus)","title":"Eternity","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2865518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Galina Myznikova","original_name":"Galina Myznikova","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/35z4smRVEurC4ZzRhFqRpvWISRl.jpg","credit_id":"5fba6fb515376c00432bf9cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2865519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Provorov","original_name":"Sergey Provorov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba6fc0a22d3e003df7fb1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2567234","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nrmxwFeDHifIhE5eQodqphHlVk6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":711}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
