Will this woman torn between a dream of the stage and a dream of love be able to achieve her goal?  Written as a tribute to Romantic opera, Prima Donna is the first venture into opera by Rufus Wainwright, better known for his career in pop. Here we discover a self-destructive diva, inspired by Maria Callas. There is something ridiculous about the faded star, but through our admiration she will shine forever.","popularity":0.2005,"poster_path":"/xeWooKlFAf87lskyGcDpUMLiKNY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prima Donna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elin Rombo","original_name":"Elin Rombo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb63e6db4a5430042541f40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beate Mordal","original_name":"Beate Mordal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb63e74d96c3c003fde13e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2437689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Carpenter","original_name":"Jeremy Carpenter","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb63e7b091e620041520211","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conny Thimander","original_name":"Conny Thimander","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb63e81ed96bc0040b1e31f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruben Lundström","original_name":"Ruben Lundström","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb63e87ed96bc0040b1e326","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadja Sjöström","original_name":"Nadja Sjöström","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb63e8e9ae613003ea45cae","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rufus Wainwright","original_name":"Rufus Wainwright","popularity":0.3277,"profile_path":"/6JKOGgb0UowE0Ad81Urjpn5BPRT.jpg","credit_id":"6537210af495ee013ae10467","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861884,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jayce Ogren","original_name":"Jayce Ogren","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb63e9decbde9003cb3d726","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mårten Forslund","original_name":"Mårten Forslund","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb63ec6a6c104003ea4d059","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":957,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xeWooKlFAf87lskyGcDpUMLiKNY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":638}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
