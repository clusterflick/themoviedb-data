One night, he is stabbed by drug dealers and almost dies. To get out of his addictions he wrote the scenario of a film \"Spiral\" close to autofiction where he would play the main role of Daniel. Olivier Rainer, a director whom he admires, agrees to direct the movie and make Alexander pass screen tests while rewriting the script by incorporating elements of the personal life of the actor. Alexander wishing to exorcise his demons and reach his catharsis will follow Olivier unconditionally in a blistering adventure where reality and fiction merge.","popularity":0.3838,"poster_path":"/kiZCD78g637GOxSn9IcJRPr9PH6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spiral","video":false,"vote_average":4.667,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofiene
