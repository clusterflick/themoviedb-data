Near Elves’ Hill (Elverhøjen) lives Karen, a superstitious farmer’s wife, with her daughter Agnete. Agnete and the noble Sir Ebbesen are very much in love, but to their great sorrow Ebbesen is betrothed to the noble-born Elisabeth Munk. But not everything is as it seems. For Karen is not Agnete’s real mother: she found the baby girl on Elves’ Hill the very same night that the infant Elisabeth Munk, goddaughter of King Christian IV, disappeared from her parents’ home. When King Christian arrives in the area where his goddaughter’s wedding is to take place, he becomes something of a detective and sets out to untangle the entire mystery.
