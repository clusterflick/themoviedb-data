The spring, usually a time of joyful resurgence of life, rushed by at a snail's pace, an agonized wait for the curves to flatten or the virus to run its course. In \"Suspended Spring,\" the swirling augmented reality cherry blossoms, in Japanese culture a sign of the beauty and the impermanence of life, follow you around wherever you go, inside or outside, as the traditional song \"Sakura\" is slowed and stretched beyond recognition. A memento mori for life in the time of Coronavirus, 2020.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tDrnnqiryyQFyMglI5G8ddy4L89.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suspended Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamiko Thiel","original_name":"Tamiko Thiel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb956a057176f003cda0d38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tDrnnqiryyQFyMglI5G8ddy4L89.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Telematic Media Arts","release_date":"2020-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
