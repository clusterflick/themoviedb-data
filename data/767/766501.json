He has promised to take her to the Garbage Gentlemen's Rally, that annual society event of the small town in which it is their fortune to reside, and she sends him a note to this effect. He is a rank outsider, but manages to inject himself into the spirit of the affair and enters into the sport of the occasion with a vim. It is at this event that the ashes throwing contest is held every year, and garbage men from all sections, trained to the minute, flock to the party to compete. The contest is at its height and one of the experts is trying for a world's record when Oscar crosses the range. Of course, he and Maisie manage to get in the way of the winning throw and spoil the record which is about to be made.","popularity":0.1708,"poster_path":"/9aUJGo2wwaSP0UabiiSwrStQOUx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rolin Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruses, Rhymes and Roughnecks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Lloyd","original_name":"Harold Lloyd","popularity":0.3488,"profile_path":"/alOOCzYnr08aEYekwsA3onrdeXk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Oscar Weeban aka Lonesome Luke","credit_id":"5fb81f55221ba60042b86d75","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry 'Snub' Pollard","original_name":"Harry 'Snub' Pollard","popularity":0.3279,"profile_path":"/srCQa37TG3RHKx5PuthzjsTpe6n.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb81f5df18ce7004201592f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bebe Daniels","original_name":"Bebe Daniels","popularity":0.2266,"profile_path":"/5vZGoSlVqUXFxilSEeApppLAfLL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb81f8a33ad8f003e59f08a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Marsh","original_name":"Gene Marsh","popularity":0.328,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Maisie","credit_id":"5fb81f6924b333003c83a801","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3533571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Spinks","original_name":"Jack Spinks","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62701befcb71b813f66a0b82","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33223,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hal Roach","original_name":"Hal Roach","popularity":0.2083,"profile_path":"/cV3xbMdZEQdNhHKdI9T6BL2PBSy.jpg","credit_id":"5fb81f9c8cfcc7003f516baf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0005993","wikidata_id":"Q3942851","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9aUJGo2wwaSP0UabiiSwrStQOUx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
