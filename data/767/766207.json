It employs voice, sound design, and archive film to tell the remarkable story of Dick Perceval. The discovery of his diaries in a pile of rubbish inspired the production and its exploration of his life in England during the mid 20th century. A cast of hundreds enters Percevalâ€™s world via archive film drawn from old Hollywood movies, public information broadcasts, cine club creations, and home movies.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/hsRNzag1rHDckoQBuQdO3BeTbmR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Be Continued","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2862338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Becky Edmunds","original_name":"Becky Edmunds","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb6ca70cf4b8b003f88a16d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13282314","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1403,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yPzehgx3QSiHktryWl9I3Ze509s.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2494}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1925,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hsRNzag1rHDckoQBuQdO3BeTbmR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1283}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"AMPLIFY! film festival","release_date":"2020-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
