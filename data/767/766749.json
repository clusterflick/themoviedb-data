The film portrays his tireless political and cultural work, his encounters with famous figures, the extra-parliamentary groups, ideological excesses, discovering new authors and directors. Social work as a political resource. The profile of a heretical intellectual and an extraordinary cultural organizer reveals a very critical view of Italian society, its power mechanisms, and the injustice that leaves a mark on it.","popularity":0.1549,"poster_path":"/yJ852d4fTdmjZ7SJMtj768qdrTo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76923,"logo_path":"/dr2ZprLwhfLBFwc7dLf0sggh0fu.png","name":"Avventurosa","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":317,"logo_path":"/HJj0J9Tk6AGcLpL4O7mI3bsccM.png","name":"Istituto
