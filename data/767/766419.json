There is one thing the mother must say. These are the days before Christmas. There is also a girl, who finds herself living those days with them. It looks so familiar. There is an expectation and a forced closeness. A new fish for the aquarium and an engagement ring. Old school notebooks and a remote control that is no longer found. A ringing phone and an old story of Red Indian shamans. There are certain spirits in that house who are struggling to leave.","popularity":0.2547,"poster_path":"/cCOaabDjH7W6831b4Avt1PJt9jU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83273,"logo_path":null,"name":"Meproducodasolo","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":144471,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatrodilina","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Almost
