The action is followed by a variety of spectators, some wild and vociferous, some suffering in silence form what they see; men and women, poor and rich... Then, one sees the amateurs next day, as they work in their true professions, mostly humble ones: street-sweepers, butchers... The end is the beginning: the training, and the warming up until another boxer goes up a spiral metal staircase to another match in another derelict boxing arena.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pugilatori","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerio Zurlini","original_name":"Valerio Zurlini","popularity":0.1696,"profile_path":"/qCinI6hXKot9mGF8clUGmeg91X9.jpg","credit_id":"5fb942d03c887d0041a8195b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0196031","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"Italian\"}","note":"","release_date":"1951-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
