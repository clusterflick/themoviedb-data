I wouldn't have thought her voice would be so well suited to Violetta Valéry in La Traviata, and it does take some getting used to, but I think she at least brings a distinct quality to the role with an emotional heart that isn't always necessarily there when a leading diva uses it primarily as a display for her vocal talents. It's served well also by Antonio Pappano's conducting of the Royal Opera House Orchestra in a traditional, but effective production by Richard Eyre.","popularity":0.3877,"poster_path":"/pWOdInQT31UuVQVSg0MZ6NlDkzQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Traviata","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La Extraviada","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":269139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Fleming","original_name":"Renée Fleming","popularity":0.3384,"profile_path":"/7L6CEpZS2eYmKZquDTFTSpEbTiz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Violetta Valéry","credit_id":"52fe4b81c3a368484e18c327","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":485620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Calleja","original_name":"Joseph Calleja","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/3ElrV7iefsTnkH642MgPk7pp367.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alfredo Germont","credit_id":"52fe4b81c3a368484e18c32b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":460831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Hampson","original_name":"Thomas Hampson","popularity":0.2539,"profile_path":"/6DGBYLORYO3uKvJrWUCV2rNswbh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Giorgio Germont","credit_id":"52fe4b81c3a368484e18c32f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monika-Evelin Liiv","original_name":"Monika-Evelin Liiv","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Flora Bervoix","credit_id":"52fe4b81c3a368484e18c345","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Wade","original_name":"Eddie Wade","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Il barone Douphol","credit_id":"52fe4b81c3a368484e18c349","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kostas Smoriginas","original_name":"Kostas Smoriginas","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/dMbpRjnCnL3gKPr9XHp2l5EzyOe.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Il Marchese d'Obigny","credit_id":"674070ac5cac041cfae279f5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006168,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonio Pappano","original_name":"Antonio Pappano","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/sUQ9lJlOJVBXm1DtWaqNaxUyOIa.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff95203336e0100407e4bf9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Wiegold","original_name":"Richard Wiegold","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Il dottor Grenvil","credit_id":"674071004dfa06b5df92f211","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orchestra of the Royal Opera House","original_name":"Orchestra of the Royal Opera House","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self -
