Cynical audiences might not buy into it, but if you were to go back to the early 1600s this is probably the way you'd see it. The plot of Macbeth, if you were snoozing during high school English class, is about an 11th century Scottish warrior who hatches a dubious plan to steal the throne. Spurred on by his wife Lady Macbeth, who wears the pants in the household, he finds himself swiftly slipping down the path of evil.","popularity":1.5427,"poster_path":"/6RkczB8cbAvGHlk9QAElqBL3MNT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1961-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MacBeth","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Макбет","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Connery","original_name":"Sean Connery","popularity":2.1649,"profile_path":"/hbB676mW62gjsh0f51ICYE11niG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"MacBeth","credit_id":"52fe4b75c3a368484e189d0d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":937681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Caldwell","original_name":"Zoe Caldwell","popularity":0.2498,"profile_path":"/vukuSt1kVgGC8sTOU44BUrqiLhN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lady Macbeth","credit_id":"576798a5c3a3683cb9000754","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Gammell","original_name":"Robin Gammell","popularity":0.3342,"profile_path":"/aCbZa9rJOeGWfAVUJT6a22RgzBG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Malcolm","credit_id":"576798b3c3a3683f57000826","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Behrens","original_name":"Bernard Behrens","popularity":0.3912,"profile_path":"/6ibwaHJ45ZExo1eyUIJrATKdio7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lennox","credit_id":"576798bf9251410fb60002dd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Christmas","original_name":"Eric Christmas","popularity":0.6618,"profile_path":"/tmVR8gYQXG4pdUmGJLlbspfzmmf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Porter","credit_id":"576798cb92514110150002eb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Dane","original_name":"Lawrence Dane","popularity":0.2606,"profile_path":"/u67sYvj2kblUIbWxG88pGP7gdyY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Seyton","credit_id":"576798d792514110150002ef","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Almond","original_name":"Paul Almond","popularity":0.1242,"profile_path":"/xdLSNc1UmbIYOfSe2SCxV5VUePX.jpg","credit_id":"5767998c9251410f8a0002ea","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Almond","original_name":"Paul Almond","popularity":0.1242,"profile_path":"/xdLSNc1UmbIYOfSe2SCxV5VUePX.jpg","credit_id":"5767999ac3a368648c0002d1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Shakespeare","original_name":"William Shakespeare","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/60ZqefTZIgfGtklgihIjXmi4ClH.jpg","credit_id":"5767997f9251415b93000b47","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Almond","original_name":"Paul Almond","popularity":0.1242,"profile_path":"/xdLSNc1UmbIYOfSe2SCxV5VUePX.jpg","credit_id":"5767995dc3a3683cb9000772","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0400618","wikidata_id":"Q16661870","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":7.43,"height":107,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jtfFFSRYhswStTxvFaYhycmRdmk.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":795}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.748,"height":1043,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6pqp5Knypf3B61NOG6wzwZjYGJJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6RkczB8cbAvGHlk9QAElqBL3MNT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":388,"name":"scotland"},{"id":173971,"name":"taunting"},{"id":226647,"name":"regicide"},{"id":228166,"name":"11th century"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MACBETH (1961) Sean Connery & Zoe Caldwell","key":"5JLdA7QECiw","published_at":"2007-07-17T15:33:29.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"57679a9f9251415b93000b6b"}]}}}
