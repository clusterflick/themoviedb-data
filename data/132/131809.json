In 1996, two aged teachers and the children and their families reunite. Lisa Gossels, whose father and uncle were among the children, records it. Survivors' comments, photos and drawings from the war, footage of the school and town, and a celebration of the heroism and leadership of the school's director, Felix Chevrier, comprise the film.","popularity":0.0884,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":238170,"logo_path":null,"name":"Good Egg Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":238171,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wetherell & Associates","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children of Chabannes","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dean Wetherell","original_name":"Dean Wetherell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b7fc3a368484e18bdc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Gossels","original_name":"Lisa Gossels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b7fc3a368484e18bdc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Gossels","original_name":"Lisa Gossels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d8c199ac5ccaa8339d8680","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dean Wetherell","original_name":"Dean Wetherell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d8c1a09f916816a06ced69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938459,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joel Goodman","original_name":"Joel Goodman","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/wwtKg0n88YwrWpyIn2Nq9m4tJre.jpg","credit_id":"66d8c1a90c711cc77429e7dc","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116084,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mustapha Barat","original_name":"Mustapha Barat","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d8c1b25ecec696f6b8b8e5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2469683,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Philippe Bonnier","original_name":"Philippe Bonnier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d8c1ba3e7e2814f08f071d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Gossels","original_name":"Lisa Gossels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d8c1c26b4c464887b8b4e7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dean Wetherell","original_name":"Dean Wetherell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d8c1c8123121307e6cecea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0202831","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nantucket Film Festival","release_date":"1999-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
