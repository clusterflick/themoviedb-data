The movie was initially an unauthorized production, set to capitalize on the then in-production 1989 Batman film starring Michael Keaton. Warner Brothers threatened legal action and the release of the film was delayed until legal entanglements could be sorted out. The film was released in 1991, two years later than the intended 1989 release.","popularity":0.3331,"poster_path":"/m7ysdICz4AMvFTU8wYKz3i69n6P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8238,"logo_path":"/3f3SS3sep9V3Nf7RAxNd5UUEw1E.png","name":"Regal Entertainment","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1991-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alias Batman and Robin","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey de Leon","original_name":"Joey de Leon","popularity":1.7803,"profile_path":"/zgoKnOgQiK8ScMziQTuBXTBdkQA.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Kuya / Batman","credit_id":"539820220e0a266dc200c47b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keempee de Leon","original_name":"Keempee de Leon","popularity":0.1567,"profile_path":"/z9ZLR7scjHFK0vyEGd023Yh215s.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kevin / Robin","credit_id":"537212b20e0a2672f8001a92","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dawn Zulueta","original_name":"Dawn Zulueta","popularity":0.5342,"profile_path":"/dIuGF1WlDbt0PFLjDf9RqEEAOWT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Angelique Legarda","credit_id":"52fe4b70c3a368484e189119","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":941413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vina Morales","original_name":"Vina Morales","popularity":0.4117,"profile_path":"/uhuZFzjWyxMLXPGQa0vOEd42ce1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vina","credit_id":"52fe4b70c3a368484e18911d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1092992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Requiestas","original_name":"Rene Requiestas","popularity":0.2433,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jocson / Joker","credit_id":"52fe4b70c3a368484e189115","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1319159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Panchito","original_name":"Panchito","popularity":0.3114,"profile_path":"/7FFuUfRQUCUlbNzkekSeZ7QHn6l.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tiyo Paeng / The Penguin","credit_id":"53721579c3a368434300102c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Y.
