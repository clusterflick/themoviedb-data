That is until an orphan named Danny comes to live with them. Jed immediately accepts Danny as his son, but Martha is still too upset to be able to love him. As time passes, however, she finds herself more and more able to accept him as part of the family.","popularity":1.2413,"poster_path":"/5mlYJK3kWRPcR7gifTu9AAsHhQ5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2052,"logo_path":null,"name":"FFF","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seasons of the Heart","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":77634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leigh Lombardi","original_name":"Leigh Lombardi","popularity":0.598,"profile_path":"/qnscaPGV8y8hKyKr4d1pf04tD04.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Martha Richards","credit_id":"52fe4b7fc3a368484e18bd65","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":164630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Hennings","original_name":"Sam Hennings","popularity":0.3886,"profile_path":"/wVw51UxN2q68F3bXEVm2P5v4HkC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jed Richards","credit_id":"52fe4b7fc3a368484e18bd69","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Akins","original_name":"Claude Akins","popularity":1.1344,"profile_path":"/bPj4MN7pI96WiIp0vK7cyNY0wtX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Pastor William Clay","credit_id":"52fe4b7fc3a368484e18bd6d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Logan Hall","original_name":"Logan Hall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Daniel Merriss","credit_id":"52fe4b7fc3a368484e18bd71","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne De Carlo","original_name":"Yvonne De Carlo","popularity":0.881,"profile_path":"/cldx7C9iQlVJIdrPWbGlu2HidVW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Older Martha (voice)","credit_id":"52fe4b7fc3a368484e18bd75","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093724,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lael J.
