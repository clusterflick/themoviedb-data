Meanwhile, Anna Magnani, one of Italy’s biggest stars and Rossellini’s longtime lover, was furious. When the Rossellini/Bergman project was announced as a tale set on Stromboli, one of the volcanic Aeolian Islands, Magnani quickly set up her own Aeolian project, financed by Hollywood, to be called Volcano. Italy’s tabloids simply went wild: the prospect of these two great divas battling it out with rival productions was breathlessly followed, especially as it became clear that the Rossellini/Bergman relationship was more than professional. Francesco Patierno has created an engrossing, revealing and highly entertaining chronicle of this cinematic battle royal.","popularity":0.5042,"poster_path":"/xEObseYkivPFPltozHqY8KgJzVg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The War of the Volcanoes","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingrid Bergman","original_name":"Ingrid Bergman","popularity":1.4274,"profile_path":"/9LdhzK5CVkLZjRdQ08V9C0Oiu9I.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5ba166fc0e0a263af3005a64","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberto Rossellini","original_name":"Roberto Rossellini","popularity":0.6127,"profile_path":"/dEfCuU0CoIqhgoEDtHZpIoNWNVj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5ba1671ac3a3680c330066ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Magnani","original_name":"Anna Magnani","popularity":0.54,"profile_path":"/ygpE4VtT0TtrF2mfceJBT8u2Nhh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5ba1670bc3a3680c24005c6c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesco Patierno","original_name":"Francesco Patierno","popularity":0.0976,"profile_path":"/jn7UC1CTMVe0xfaz8QOJZgCXlSu.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b71c3a368484e189399","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2388426","wikidata_id":"Q20650032","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k44mHNGpueP5v1JQAk5gseFb3LS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xEObseYkivPFPltozHqY8KgJzVg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/hDs8EKJ5JF9bi7ziWanuDkqnHvQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
