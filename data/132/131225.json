It's about a group of eight friends that upon hearing of Yorktown Memorial Hospital from an ill guided bar patron, played by actor/comedian and NBC's Last Comic's Standing finalist Dante, the group decides to take a road trip to the haunted location and \"investigate\", despite the heeded warnings from the bartender, played by actress Rebekah Kochan. What they don't realize is that someone has taken up residence in the building and someone is trying to revenge a death. When you don't pay attention to your friends, bad things happen. The movie takes a traditional plot and adds modern social elements with a plot twist.","popularity":0.0947,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's not just ghosts that make you scream","title":"Yorktown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebekah Kochan","original_name":"Rebekah Kochan","popularity":0.157,"profile_path":"/pNau5bZIGvcaaqHyTpWYtFlyktB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Heather","credit_id":"52fe4b71c3a368484e1895b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bridget Blankenship","original_name":"Bridget Blankenship","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"52fe4b72c3a368484e1895b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamie Carpenter","original_name":"Tamie Carpenter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Rachel","credit_id":"52fe4b72c3a368484e1895b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas Chance","original_name":"Lucas Chance","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Caleb","credit_id":"52fe4b72c3a368484e1895bd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Lee Chance","original_name":"Nicholas Lee Chance","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Brett","credit_id":"52fe4b72c3a368484e1895c1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandy Combs","original_name":"Brandy Combs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Alexis","credit_id":"52fe4b72c3a368484e1895c5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Evans","original_name":"Jeff Evans","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Justin","credit_id":"52fe4b72c3a368484e1895c9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicki Jo Harlan","original_name":"Nicki Jo Harlan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sharon","credit_id":"52fe4b72c3a368484e1895cd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Becky Moore","original_name":"Becky Moore","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Ghost Girl","credit_id":"52fe4b72c3a368484e1895d1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093100,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Kelly O'Connell","original_name":"John Kelly O'Connell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"David","credit_id":"52fe4b72c3a368484e1895d5","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Pittman","original_name":"Rachel Pittman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Samantha","credit_id":"52fe4b72c3a368484e1895d9","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shawn Shaw","original_name":"Shawn Shaw","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Kyle","credit_id":"52fe4b72c3a368484e1895dd","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shawn Stasel","original_name":"Shawn Stasel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Austin","credit_id":"52fe4b72c3a368484e1895e1","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Wilkes","original_name":"Sean Wilkes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Jacob","credit_id":"52fe4b72c3a368484e1895e5","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093105,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elizabeth L.
