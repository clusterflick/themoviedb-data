For the first time in 35 years, he\r agreed to record with a symphony orchestra in a studio.\r He chose the conductor, Carlo Maria Giulini, the orchestra,\r the La Scala Philharmonic, and the location, the Abanella\r recording studio of La Scala in Milan. Horowitz steadfastly\r refused to allow the month-long sessions to be filmed, until\r the evening before the last scheduled session when he\r unexpectedly changed his mind. His manager, Peter Gelb,\r immediately telephoned Albert Maysles and Susan Froemke\r in New York, the co-filmmakers of \"Vladimir Horowitz:\r The Last Romantic.\" That same night, the Maysles film\r crew flew from New York.","popularity":0.126,"poster_path":"/uYlwq4jUB5c3FbEVc5DqItW16Ki.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Horowitz Plays Mozart","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Horowitz","original_name":"Vladimir Horowitz","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/lAHDf4PWlYXeV38qYRLunm3yEXc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Performer (piano)/Self","credit_id":"52fe4b76c3a368484e189fcb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1028309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Froemke","original_name":"Susan Froemke","popularity":0.1445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b75c3a368484e189fbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Maysles","original_name":"Albert Maysles","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/dlel1CxK3lhhZt3inUjOpMQo8A.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b75c3a368484e189fc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Zwerin","original_name":"Charlotte Zwerin","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/bVaXLZwU2lrs0zRqYyHQ5fFW7dp.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b76c3a368484e189fc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0209028","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uYlwq4jUB5c3FbEVc5DqItW16Ki.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
