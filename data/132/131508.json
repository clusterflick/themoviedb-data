Mozart and Falco were great geniuses who worked to the point of self-destruction. Falco is not the big superstar, but a staged character - Mozart is portrayed in the musical as a musical genius with a soulmate. The musical looks behind the scenes of show business, which not only has its good (acclaimed performances) but also bad sides. Furthermore, the story is largely based on motifs from the classic Faust story (pact with the devil, fallen girl, etc.).","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":"/cYHN0kEaRiSlWwVY544zpdvIA1F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The sensational musical show as a live stage film","title":"Falco meets Amadeus","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Otte","original_name":"Matthias Otte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Falco","credit_id":"52fe4b7ac3a368484e18af0b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Kindschuh","original_name":"Andreas Kindschuh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Amadeus","credit_id":"52fe4b7ac3a368484e18af0f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ute Baum","original_name":"Ute Baum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Konny","credit_id":"52fe4b7ac3a368484e18af13","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elmar Ottenthal","original_name":"Elmar Ottenthal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b7ac3a368484e18af1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/cYHN0kEaRiSlWwVY544zpdvIA1F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
