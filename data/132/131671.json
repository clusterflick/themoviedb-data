Kazan's life outside the movie set is equally noteworthy, and this film utilizes various interviews to illustrate his controversial appearance before the House Un-American Activities Committee in the '50s. Elia Kazan is one of America's most respected directors, and this video provides a unique glimpse into the life of a man who has left a lasting mark on the worlds of both cinema and theatre. ~ Dan Macintosh, Rovi","popularity":0.7223,"poster_path":"/deQ7HVDfv3IcgMMba8Bo7gtwlTg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lorac Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elia Kazan: A Director's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eli Wallach","original_name":"Eli Wallach","popularity":1.3923,"profile_path":"/s452wxFLaOwAIs6juD0rrvxaFxL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4b7cc3a368484e18b2b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elia Kazan","original_name":"Elia Kazan","popularity":0.4026,"profile_path":"/4Hu3AoSEYrdgzwkwYu7ry683uFj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b7cc3a368484e18b2bb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Schickel","original_name":"Richard Schickel","popularity":0.4543,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b7cc3a368484e18b2b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12405,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Douglas Freeman","original_name":"Douglas Freeman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b7cc3a368484e18b2d3","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552212,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julian Schlossberg","original_name":"Julian Schlossberg","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b7cc3a368484e18b2c7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Schickel","original_name":"Richard Schickel","popularity":0.4543,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b7cc3a368484e18b2c1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093504,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Becky Patch","original_name":"Becky Patch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b7cc3a368484e18b2e5","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44952,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bryan McKenzie","original_name":"Bryan McKenzie","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b7cc3a368484e18b2df","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12405,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Douglas Freeman","original_name":"Douglas Freeman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630a1c8e65c26c007fe638a1","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78655,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ed Marritz","original_name":"Ed Marritz","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8bed4c0e0a2652ab08b537","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0246601","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":991,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/deQ7HVDfv3IcgMMba8Bo7gtwlTg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
