As a result, over 90 percent of the country's traditional musicians were killed. Now, as the handful of surviving musicians grow old and fall ill, a way of life quietly slips toward the brink of extinction. Facing this desperate situation is Arn Chorn Pond - a survivor of Cambodia's genocide, an internationally recognized human rights leader and a talented musician. Today Arn is striving to heal the deep scars of his wartorn past by bringing Cambodia's once outlawed traditional music back to his people. The Flute Player is a heroic story of one man's fight against the devastating effects of war. It is a film about sorrow and pain, dignity and freedom, and the will to survive.","popularity":0.1397,"poster_path":"/gaZXfHV7cdYGx3BZGsHdsk74Z3I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flute Player","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1796355,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jocelyn Glatzer","original_name":"Jocelyn Glatzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6d33e965686e38998774ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1141254","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gaZXfHV7cdYGx3BZGsHdsk74Z3I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
