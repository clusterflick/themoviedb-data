After becoming an accomplished college and professional basketball player, he made a major move into Democratic politics and advocacy. This might sound like an unexpected career change, but to Bradley it was the next logical step. The same can be said for how he worked on an oral history of his life and career for three years, excruciatingly committing it to memory, before premiering it in New York City in December 2021. Rolling Along is the live theatrical recording of this monumental performance. Interspersing archival footage with Bradley’s performance, the film honors a uniquely American life, paying tribute to the act of storytelling in a way that hasn’t been done in a very long time. In our times of division and uncertainty, perhaps we can all learn something from Bradley’s stories about perseverance, acceptance, and unity.","popularity":0.4847,"poster_path":"/wSguEIxmVCafa3vMFfX8nRxJ5OK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rolling Along","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Bradley","original_name":"Bill Bradley","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64566f586aa8e00139b9de64","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Tollin","original_name":"Michael Tollin","popularity":0.3159,"profile_path":"/zZEUZh2Oh20wFBXaEfGvwqCBWmv.jpg","credit_id":"64566f6afe077a0173351fc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Bradley","original_name":"Bill Bradley","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64566f7afe077a00e43f6643","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30893248","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wSguEIxmVCafa3vMFfX8nRxJ5OK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6496,"name":"basketball"},{"id":6656,"name":"one-man show"},{"id":155037,"name":"democrat"},{"id":249992,"name":"college basketball"},{"id":250916,"name":"democratic party"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
