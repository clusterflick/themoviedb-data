They are smugglers, the visible actors of the collusion between criminal organizations and the legal, political and financial structures of countries crushed by narco-violence. This investigation penetrates into the depths of drug trafficking through a little-known angle, that of justice, and aims to deconstruct the preconceived idea of the drug trafficker as the sole responsible for violence. \"If you kill, call me\" debunks the myth of drug trafficking by penetrating, through drug trafficker lawyers, into the heart of the legal system to reveal its deep complicity with organized crime.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":"/smFLcHB8rZSsRVxf5al4Ct7xYMc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37399,"logo_path":"/vUyYBIdAPwHZv47GRXF3NJJRupf.png","name":"Ladybirds Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":199544,"logo_path":null,"name":"PRL Production","origin_country":""},{"id":195602,"logo_path":null,"name":"khora film","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If You Kill, Call Me","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4051079,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Febbro","original_name":"Eduardo Febbro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6458bdf0156cc7017d72854e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1720297,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maxence Dussère","original_name":"Maxence Dussère","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6458be03fe077a00ff946269","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wWLyXlrpV4eied7syD1kpnKKQRo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/smFLcHB8rZSsRVxf5al4Ct7xYMc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
