The picture quality and sound are excellent, as are all the camera angles. Eric has a great band who do all the songs full justice and reproduce the original sounds where needed (e.g. on San Franciscan Nights and Spill The Wine)- they are Aynsley Dunbar on drums, Dean Restum on guitar, David Meros on bass and Neal Morse on keyboards and guitar.  There are also five interesting interviews with Eric where he talks about the history of some of the featured songs. These fit in very well between some of the songs, but I don't feel they spoil the continuity and they do not interrupt any songs. Eric performs as his fans would expect - plenty of stage presence and integrity and on the whole he sings extremely well with far less shouting than he has done on some other concert occasions.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tTcNEHOdWljZsUS1NKc2xzsJQio.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eric Burdon & The New Animals: Live at the Coach House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kAfR6aoWvKC1kDHadqhK9mMTNpV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tTcNEHOdWljZsUS1NKc2xzsJQio.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
