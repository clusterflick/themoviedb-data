He was perhaps best known for his affecting rendition of the Erroll Garner composition “Misty” (1959).  Mathis grew up in a large working-class family in San Francisco. He developed an appreciation of music from his father, a former vaudeville performer, and, as a child, he sang regularly in church and at school events. From age 13 he also took vocal lessons, which provided him with a classical foundation for his burgeoning talent.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nMtXLV1tMaMd6wmGl4tJByhoP1m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Johnny Mathis - Live in Chicago","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7vmHyxeHhSmyeQKBAUp4SCmW4GK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nMtXLV1tMaMd6wmGl4tJByhoP1m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
