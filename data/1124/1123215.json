His godson Tsim Tsui-mau and wife Ho Bit-siu, and friend George Cheung use every trick in the book, even hiring the alluring singer Lin Yung-so, to entertain and curry favour with the loaded returnee. Unfortunately Wong's saving, totalling 10 million dollars, is only due to arrive in two weeks. Penniless, he remains evasive over financial matters. Tsim thinks that Wong is a swindler and leaves in a fit of anger. Lin gives him a hand in his moment of need, and love blossoms between them. Mau and others believe that Lin must have gathered evidence of Wong's wealth and thus forcibly take him home. Realising Tsim's snobbishness, Wong admits to a fuming Tsim that he a broke man. Finally the money arrives. Wong cherishes Lin's love and marries her, but shows the door to the remorseful Tsim and friends.","popularity":0.4092,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":91004,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dali Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Much Ado About Nothing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3444866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leung Sing Po","original_name":"Leung Sing Po","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Silly Wong","credit_id":"6456eaf277d23b0119df8dac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":567302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Law Yim-Hing","original_name":"Law Yim-Hing","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/fcMqjVfsK5pQMiabjf1y8RUro2t.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lin Yung-so","credit_id":"6456eb026c849200e35c8e6c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3442027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tang Kei-chen","original_name":"Tang Kei-chen","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tsim Tsui-mau","credit_id":"6456eb18156cc700e39caa51","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tam Lan-Hing","original_name":"Tam Lan-Hing","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ho Bit-siu","credit_id":"6456eb28fe077a00ff935849","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheng Kwun-Min","original_name":"鄭君綿","popularity":0.2428,"profile_path":"/1MDmD0Q7i3qTaqy9xva1oqbBJLu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"George Cheung","credit_id":"6456eb3a77d23b00fcc995f6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3350141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Hong Kum","original_name":"Lee Hong Kum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs Tsim","credit_id":"6456eb65fe077a01398b876f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1699208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheung Sang","original_name":"Cheung Sang","popularity":0.0792,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"hotel waiter","credit_id":"6456eb86fe077a00e43fa676","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Pang-Fei","original_name":"Lee Pang-Fei","popularity":0.1556,"profile_path":"/anQskwwtirj1wUgYSIGn45GV76J.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bank manager","credit_id":"6456eb931b70ae01260b1b80","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1820529,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ho Man-Keung","original_name":"Ho Man-Keung","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6456ebce156cc700ffa5fe0c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1700151,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yim Ngau","original_name":"Yim Ngau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6456ebe7156cc7015e75c636","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1699244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chu Chiu","original_name":"Chu Chiu","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6456ec5c77d23b00fcc9979e","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4048615,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Louie Yu Tin","original_name":"Louie Yu Tin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6456ec411b70ae0145ec3f7a","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chu Kei","original_name":"Chu Kei","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6456ebbcfe077a015675726e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132461,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lee Yuen-Man","original_name":"Lee Yuen-Man","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6456ec226aa8e000ff59e909","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":273707,"name":"comic adaptation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Lui Yu-tin's comic 'Silly Wong'.
