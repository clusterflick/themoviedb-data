This inveterate animal lover presented us yesterday with his short film  Crocs urbains.  Brilliantly produced, this 23-minute documentary plunged us into the urban barbarism of hound fights, a macho, phallic, clandestine world which, on the margins of society, features combat dogs programmed to kill, violent scenes which in no way condone violence.  Against this backdrop of machismo, a luscious and charming doctor describes the suffering and mistreatment of these animals and calls for an end to this kind of barbarism!","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97934,"logo_path":"/udAuMSL53Yv0CEKIRNUdbX8nMUm.png","name":"Fédération tunisienne des cinéastes amateurs (FTCA)","origin_country":"TN"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urban Crocs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4050521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marouane Meddeb","original_name":"Marouane Meddeb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64583e25156cc700ffa6a984","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
