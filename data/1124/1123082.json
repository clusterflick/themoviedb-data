The family returns to a community in which governmental corruption strikes distrust amongst the people, dictating the way in which they live day to day. Home of the Santo Nino de Atocha (Holy Infant of Atocha), who is believed to have guided local miners out of collapsed mines, the shrine stands as a testament to the irony displayed between hope and complacency in Plateros. Despite this, the concept of family challenges this notion and supersedes the separation brought on by these circumstances.  This documentary shot in the observational mode offers viewers a glimpse into the lives of those living in this era, as well as the places they look towards to overcome the distrust, irony, and fear in their community.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jkgb0wD21Cql4vMw3PaRH0cYYcf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"hijos de perros","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4048207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucio Arellano","original_name":"Lucio Arellano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64568eec77d23b00e2f41f60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jkgb0wD21Cql4vMw3PaRH0cYYcf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
