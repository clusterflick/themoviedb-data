Seven interview subjects: a philosophy professor, a film professor, a humanities professor, a retired lawyer turned archivist, a volunteer, a dance student, and a fashion student, explore their backgrounds with religion, their current personal philosophies, whether or not they believe we have a purpose, or if the things we do have any meaning at all. Eventually everything wraps back around to love.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/yVNy3BQf7OamhFaljX3JntERWMy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":260851,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cadence Film Projects","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Love is the antidote","title":"What's Going On?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5406651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cadence Porisch","original_name":"Cadence Porisch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68123e89a528d8e68a353582","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5406652,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Celeste Pinel","original_name":"Celeste Pinel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68123e99c6c021eef7145799","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5406654,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Parker Freeman","original_name":"Parker Freeman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68123ebf06c6e10f7a145695","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"Whatsgoingon_documentary","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.744,"height":1439,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yVNy3BQf7OamhFaljX3JntERWMy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1071}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":490,"name":"philosophy"},{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":210710,"name":"absurdist"},{"id":251788,"name":"self exploration"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":333018,"name":"albert camus"},{"id":333793,"name":"discussion"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Premiering at Columbia College Chicago's Manifest Festival","release_date":"2025-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
