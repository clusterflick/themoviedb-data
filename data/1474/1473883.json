Quinta Essentia","overview":"A musical documentary about the composer and teacher Heino Eller.\r How do you tell the story of a person? How do you tell the story of an artist who lived 100 years ago? Perhaps the art itself speaks for the artist—and perhaps that is enough? What matters more to us—the person, their world, or their work? Undoubtedly, an artist’s work affects both us and our lives. And perhaps that’s why it’s important to know as much as possible about the creator. What is he like, what are his convictions, what is that driving force that gives him no peace, compels him to work, and sometimes pushes him forward even against his own will? Where does this restless state come from, the one that urges him to express his feelings, thoughts, beliefs? And ultimately, what guides the artist—love or something else?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/m1hHkYvMg3FhIANrWD91gIpHcYr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6153,"logo_path":null,"name":"F-Seitse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heino Eller.
