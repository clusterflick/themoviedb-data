Four teenagers dream of the end of the war and the moment when they will be reunited with their parents and older siblings. When they discover, by chance, that their age allows them to avoid suspicion and searches, they decide to secretly help the partisans, without being discovered. Marta, Davide, Sara and Marco thus become \"Sandokan\", the mysterious rebel who puts the Nazis and fascists of the valley in difficulty. Between steep climbs and breathtaking descents, between enormous dangers and great tests of courage, the four children will contribute to the final victory of the Resistance and the liberation of Italy from enemy occupation. A great partisan adventure and a story of love and friendship, told from the point of view of thirteen-year-old Marta.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wWAOHLHf3jLDTTDcPmrOpyEadSn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":316,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fuochi
