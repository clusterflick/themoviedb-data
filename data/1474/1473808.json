This forced separation created America's first-ever major animal rescue. A dedicated and compassionate group of volunteer rescuers and animal welfare groups from around the world risked their lives to sledgehammer down doors and brave toxic floodwaters in a truly heroic effort to save nearly 10,000 animals. This film tells many uplifting stories of hope and survival as animal companions (pets) are reunited with their owners while other lucky animals find loving new homes. Dark Water Rising is a film about hope and survival in the face of the one of the worst natural disasters in American history.","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":"/mI8VJsxPHFZTWIOQ9ZVikyQHLR7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":260963,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shidog Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Compassion.
