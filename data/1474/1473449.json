Why? In this special feature-length documentary, Oscar-nominated filmmaker Stanley Nelson investigates the dramatic health disparities in the US, even as scientists confirm that there are no meaningful genetic differences between races. From the deep history of pseudoscientific beliefs about race that still permeate modern medicine, to the latest research on how experiencing discrimination can directly damage the bodyâ€™s DNA and biology, Critical Condition reveals the factors behind the health crisis facing Black Americans.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/36CiKobYdMAD8GJ73wdxeig7cpU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6773,"logo_path":"/thh8BxybjvOoI618djeXzwhGfh4.png","name":"NOVA","origin_country":"US"},{"id":40698,"logo_path":"/vD9fSV7MFoor5Bl8ZTmh8t6XKlH.png","name":"Firelight Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Critical Condition: Health in Black America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanley Nelson","original_name":"Stanley Nelson","popularity":0.1899,"profile_path":"/lRYyHCFY0U2RlMVJ7OpPYmkHMvA.jpg","credit_id":"6812c9d8fd84993d4e90fd80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1769,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/36CiKobYdMAD8GJ73wdxeig7cpU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1179}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS","release_date":"2025-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
