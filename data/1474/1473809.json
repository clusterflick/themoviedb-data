Today there are 20 women who work in the tin mine among 1000 men. In 1990, Pascuala was the first woman to be allowed to go down the shafts to work, breaking the tradition that forbade females to take employment. Now aged 56, she has been campaigning for the past 18 years for her fellow women's right to independence and recognition in a patriarchal world. This ethnographic film enters into the harsh environment of the mine with women who have followed in Pascuala's footsteps, such as Carmela and her daughter.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vU3NpnlS2Oq7eOtsN6yvBzJat0g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":260965,"logo_path":null,"name":"Graduate School of Communications Sogang University","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daughter of Chorolque","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5408840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Mi-sun","original_name":"Park Mi-sun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68139225e6b8859bf4b1fd3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5408840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Mi-sun","original_name":"Park Mi-sun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6813923ab6a529e1859b3a24","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5408840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Mi-sun","original_name":"Park Mi-sun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68139250bcac50736f9b3998","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5408843,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Choi Jong-cheol","original_name":"Choi Jong-cheol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6813927e115b92a732a0f009","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5408846,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sung Joon-lee","original_name":"Sung Joon-lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68139296bc82ca60baa0ef08","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5408848,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kim Hak-soon","original_name":"Kim Hak-soon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681392c8e4c08aa248b1fc6a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5408849,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jong Hyuk-jeon","original_name":"Jong Hyuk-jeon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681392eee4c08aa248b1fc86","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/vU3NpnlS2Oq7eOtsN6yvBzJat0g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":892}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
