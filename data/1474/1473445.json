The premise of my\r film is that not enough people are aware that there is a skateboarding culture in Trinidad and it\r is incredibly underfunded, more needs to be done in making safe places to skate and more\r needs to be done in making people, mainly kids feel safe and comfortable to come out and learn\r how to skateboard. The film looks at themes of resilience, local skaters don't have a “nice”\r skatepark, they have an abandoned wearhouse and the street so it shows dedication and the\r want for this sport/hobby as skaters use what is available to them. This film is all about showing\r that despite circumstances, the skateboarders of Trinidad will skate regardless","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/c8TK8XCJlhgyjINiuSvwLU7Nkm3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TT","name":"Trinidad and Tobago"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skating 868","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5407666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anya Aching","original_name":"Anya Aching","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6812c71a6cb3a5af4402083b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5407666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anya Aching","original_name":"Anya Aching","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6812c791ac4c5bb05b055243","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5407666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anya Aching","original_name":"Anya Aching","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6812c7b32b8ae4208605533e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5407676,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"François Elbourne","original_name":"François Elbourne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6812c808659de4f81f29b87c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c8TK8XCJlhgyjINiuSvwLU7Nkm3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
