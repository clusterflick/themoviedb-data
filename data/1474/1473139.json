This ethnographic film explores the unique approached to death among adherents of Aluk to Dolo belief system who have recently converted to Christianity. It contrasts the funerary practices of two families - one middle class and one upper class - both deeply devoted to honoring the deceased fathers. While the upper-class family held an elaborate funeral with sacrificing 170 buffaloes, the middle-class family struggles to gather enough buffaloes for their ceremony.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eBfB1ZGyqKHA6SWDhAdc0RSTVvd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2025-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One More Cup of Coffee for Ambe'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280198,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shinta Oktania Retnani","original_name":"Shinta Oktania Retnani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68120a38a4f4641c77616e33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280198,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shinta Oktania Retnani","original_name":"Shinta Oktania Retnani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68120a59fc87db1ae4054f86","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280198,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shinta Oktania Retnani","original_name":"Shinta Oktania Retnani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68120a69d52fcb6b2aa0e969","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36746992","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eBfB1ZGyqKHA6SWDhAdc0RSTVvd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Granada Centre for Visual Anthropology","release_date":"2024-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Margaret Mead Film Festival","release_date":"2025-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
