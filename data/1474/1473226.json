The boy finds solace in training and obsessing over freediving, an ancient sport that involves diving on a single breath. But his father, Alex (39), a former champion haunted by the life he left behind and the recent loss of his wife at sea during a dive, forbids him from continuing after a series of reckless behaviors. Struggling to fit in with the village and at odds with his father, Luca is at his breaking point. He's ready to risk everything to prove he’s got what it takes… and make the ultimate dive.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Icarus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakis Rouvas","original_name":"Σάκης Ρουβάς","popularity":0.3356,"profile_path":"/tt0Tu8ZLZFEl1a7MmX7TrFQrd1x.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6812473155601342260205bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5406706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Konstantinos Taramas","original_name":"Konstantinos Taramas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68124739520f74f5f9a0ebaf","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5406705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christos Kardana","original_name":"Christos Kardana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6812471b4790abface145738","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
