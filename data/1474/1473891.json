From then on, Gu Heng haunted her nights with passion but treated her like a stranger in the daylight. When he prepared for an arranged marriage, she thought it was finally over. But instead, he took her back to his home, entangling her in the web of the Gu family’s dark past. As betrayals and hidden grudges unravel, Gu Heng is wounded, forcing him to send her away—only to keep appearing whenever she’s in danger. To him, she was never just a passing indulgence. She was the obsession he couldn’t escape.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kQhA6w3ZszsxDiOvwg6qh35wFtO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"147","title":"Bittersweet Obsession","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kQhA6w3ZszsxDiOvwg6qh35wFtO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
