Market obsessions are rendered to their most primal states, flooding a present-day utopia with a nihilistic fixation over death and sexuality, rendering the whole city as a conceptually cannibalistic market of flesh. Market researchers and psychoanalysts watch in indifference as the mental states of their subjects quickly collapse into depressive torpor.","popularity":0.1265,"poster_path":"/aeCvWvvW6miVOvq8xvSD5BM5vFn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95914,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mutant Fish Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kafka's Supermarket","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1775505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allison Maier","original_name":"Allison Maier","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/3Ri6L6RMbqaC8Yoa5WaRr4LMewO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Businessman #2","credit_id":"5d14e0ab7648410030d2c778","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2349018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"C.
