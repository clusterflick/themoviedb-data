The only chance to get to the occupied area is to cross the border secretly. The border barrier, the natural dividing line, the river Enguri, all add up to the artificially-created wire line by Russian Soldiers. In search of her house, the protagonist explores lives of internally displaced persons for 24 years after the war and sinks into the art of existence that seems to be war, rather than peace. In the process, she meets with so-called 'connectors', who help her get to the occupied territory. The story portrays everlasting estranging damage occupation can bring: how it can eradicate the concept of ' home' and the comforting feeling of safety.","popularity":1.346,"poster_path":"/xChVyUir7JQJN3iGYpVCUQ8CR3V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2017-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Border crossing; war; Russia; Occupation","title":"I Swam Enguri","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Я переплыл Ингури","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2838394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anuna Bukia","original_name":"ანუნა ბუკია","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9db16719675700389f6e61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1299571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tinatin Kajrishvili","original_name":"თინათინ ყაჯრიშვილი","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750d3bc43a6abd06b6ec64f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2838394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anuna Bukia","original_name":"ანუნა ბუკია","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750d482cb1e120ccb5de34c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2185919,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lasha Khalvashi","original_name":"Lasha Khalvashi","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750d8179ec8167629d6a2db","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1443528,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Irakli Metreveli","original_name":"Irakli Metreveli","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750d83ea93bdea8c250b7f1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2993207,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Niko Tarielashvili","original_name":"Niko Tarielashvili","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750d85c5ace98ba46d486bd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5099415,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"tamar kakubava","original_name":"tamar kakubava","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750d87fa93bdea8c250b81e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2838394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anuna Bukia","original_name":"ანუნა ბუკია","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750d8909ec8167629d6a2f8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3431297,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nino Tevdorashvili","original_name":"Nino Tevdorashvili","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750d8b85ace98ba46d486e1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5970588","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nO0Z0RMvcT7724Ix3Qd1W6nTkdi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xChVyUir7JQJN3iGYpVCUQ8CR3V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":639}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ka","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
