Three outsiders and three ordinary people feel what it means to \"live\" through abnormal behavior. All of them are antisocial. Although the outlaws seem to be repeating antisocial acts, the film makes you feel the emptiness of such acts and the director's appeal to call it a \"comedy\".","popularity":0.2846,"poster_path":"/jcG3Y9nj5aUbybE9GCyNg19R1Kx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9301,"logo_path":"/fydP9BvlRioMBcSmneCGdfkcePV.png","name":"Kokuei
