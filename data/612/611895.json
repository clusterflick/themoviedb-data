Prentice Tiller, while dressing a wound in his hand, overhears the woman in the next hotel room, Gertrude Temple, telephoning Aaron Molitor, to whom she is to deliver some jewels. Posing as Molitor, Prentice calls on Gertrude but disappears when Molitor, who also has been wounded in the hand, suddenly arrives. Molitor's men capture Prentice, who narrowly escapes death in the ruins of an old church and then continues to track Molitor.","popularity":0.304,"poster_path":"/q0sVzCm0Rf5Nn7E5CxU6epinllU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midnight Madness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":217748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Clifford","original_name":"Ruth Clifford","popularity":0.266,"profile_path":"/l5x0tNNX59PmF03566UqNu140OT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gertrude Temple","credit_id":"622962ebd236e6001b2fcb68","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Harlan","original_name":"Kenneth Harlan","popularity":0.1332,"profile_path":"/nIiGHwnOGFrZW2pui9rUKRFPs5p.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Prentice Tiller","credit_id":"622962f8770700001baf2730","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry von Meter","original_name":"Harry von Meter","popularity":0.2045,"profile_path":"/memFnJZxuWx0PYxibqi5JyBhKZV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Aaron Molitor","credit_id":"622963056e938a001b7f74d4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Du Brey","original_name":"Claire Du Brey","popularity":0.3502,"profile_path":"/e8WDoA2IhvjkFMZ2OEsr7PinZEe.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lola Montez","credit_id":"622963136d1bb200463a6f58","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Holden","original_name":"Harry Holden","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Simon Temple","credit_id":"62296320d34eb3001b855dfb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Willoughby","original_name":"Louis Willoughby","popularity":0.0473,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Chevat","credit_id":"6229633212c604006efcb282","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rupert Julian","original_name":"Rupert Julian","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/9dWgryyjsLz1dw9cxMNvuB5piEh.jpg","credit_id":"622962d4d8d329001c35a62e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98005,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elliott J.
