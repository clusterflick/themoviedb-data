He captured on film what became known as \"The tour that changed Rock and Roll forever.\" The booing crowds, the scathing reviews, the stomping feet, the infamous catcall of \"Judas!\" ... all of this in response to Dylan trading in his acoustic folk guitar for an electric sound. Now, for the first time, drummer-turned-actor Mickey Jones (Sling Blade, Home Improvement), with the help of Director Joel Gilbert, chronicles the legendary 1966 Bob Dylan World Tour through his recently discovered home movies. The updated release includes new, exclusive full-length interviews with Charlie Daniels, Johnny Rivers, 1966 World Tour and Gaslight tapes sound man Richard Alderson, and new insights and revelations by Mickey Jones.","popularity":0.9162,"poster_path":"/5dqSnHykXfwBtYNemEJMayxUHUj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120039,"logo_path":null,"name":"Highway 61 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"World Tour 1966: The Home Movies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Dylan","original_name":"Bob Dylan","popularity":0.6247,"profile_path":"/pMGkRge9jE0TRgENbUYt3N5qDPl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5d12d52a0e0a2602a1d3bacb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Jones","original_name":"Mickey Jones","popularity":0.3543,"profile_path":"/tdCfPWmgFwQtrZZv7cIBWKKxH8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5d12d54a0e0a267b12ca9b85","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garth Hudson","original_name":"Garth Hudson","popularity":0.0715,"profile_path":"/nUfj7MKyylQXlY7zLGPFXhHK8gt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5d12d5539251410c95b85419","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72861,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robbie Robertson","original_name":"Robbie Robertson","popularity":0.4357,"profile_path":"/82bnxofH57Y0IcvjDVCDbUrBTqA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5d12d566c3a3687c261df331","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Levon Helm","original_name":"Levon Helm","popularity":1.0488,"profile_path":"/zc34tb129p4lBJpNaHR657tWxVv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5d12d56f925141076abb4cb2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Danko","original_name":"Rick Danko","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/rtbErZXhedEFXFfqZrIJcNqhGLE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5d12d5780e0a262177cddfa6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Manuel","original_name":"Richard Manuel","popularity":0.1129,"profile_path":"/nn3bt0ZlxuZDwJioTY3IZLL7rlT.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5d12d63b92514131e9bc2636","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.
