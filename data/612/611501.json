Luís Vieira Campos did this and found Geni, a strong woman who dreamt of opening her own store at Centro Comercial de Cedofeita, a mythical place of Porto. Between advances and retreats, between the increasing opening of the director and his character, the film reveals the unique portrait of a woman, a neighbourhood - Cedofeita - and the improbable relationships we establish when we least expect it. Luís Vieira Campos proves, with Geni, that cinema is also the \"neighbourhood\" and its people.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":"/dkTuaXGRpibQlszCEnJsj7pe1Tx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Geni","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3315078,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andressa Clain","original_name":"Andressa Clain","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644bc4d7726fb1059e062467","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Neves","original_name":"Pedro Neves","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/IDZ8fSWHojSjJ6AFGfI2N12Rq9.jpg","credit_id":"644bc45d336e01051773631a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luís Vieira Campos","original_name":"Luís Vieira Campos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/anueVQOAthzSPBv4n4yyB4RsESn.jpg","credit_id":"5d13f638c3a3685730228aff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1276682,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Regina Guimarães","original_name":"Regina Guimarães","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/9JwFcyjuTHrzpJsTjsbm7HraCS1.jpg","credit_id":"5d13f64dc3a3685730228b14","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9377470","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dkTuaXGRpibQlszCEnJsj7pe1Tx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
