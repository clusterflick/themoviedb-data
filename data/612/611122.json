His fianc√©e, Alicia Vanderveldt, abandons him for Richard Barnaby, who ridicules the pampered Lawrence and brags of his own daring exploits in foreign countries. While the Van Huyler estate is undergoing renovation, Lawrence uncovers a box containing a confession written by the family's founder, Peter Van Huyler. In it, the patriarch admits that he was actually an Irishman of humble birth who made his fortune engaging in piracy on the high seas. Delighted, Lawrence takes a construction job and adopts a fighting attitude, challenging those who had previously made fun of him.","popularity":0.296,"poster_path":"/b1IeRsVXGP7EmyX1hU5UxDtQNW0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fast Company","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franklyn Farnum","original_name":"Franklyn Farnum","popularity":0.4916,"profile_path":"/tE9xlvLgA04icdBTe7rjqgt8c2E.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lawrence Percival Van Huyler","credit_id":"641894000d5d85008387c1f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":180844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Griffith","original_name":"Katherine Griffith","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/rxMJvezhqhltjgEeNU0xBzhL2DT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Van Huyler","credit_id":"6418940e6a2227007d73e6dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lon Chaney","original_name":"Lon Chaney","popularity":0.3652,"profile_path":"/m1icBooBEqFNp24Puu7qXn2Sarr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dan McCarty","credit_id":"6418941ce74146008217a81e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1634110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Montague","original_name":"Fred Montague","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Peter Van Huyler","credit_id":"6418942b2b8a4300b8d57a46","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juanita Hansen","original_name":"Juanita Hansen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/7MIPfbm7WNF09sM2O6NLplKJQd3.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Alicia Vanderveldt","credit_id":"64189439e7414600f7ef531d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Cecil","original_name":"Edward Cecil","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Richard Barnaby","credit_id":"64189446a14bef00fd7d494e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1072362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynn Reynolds","original_name":"Lynn Reynolds","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641893c40d5d85009ba2bf63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1692033,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugene B.
