Virginia Coulson, owner of the estate, and her maid Dot arrive, and when Hammond proposes to Virginia, she refuses his declaration in favor of Jim. Later, when Donovan is found murdered, suspicion points to Jim, who is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Hammond gets evidence on the murderer, Goofus, a half wit, and plans to use it to force Virginia to marry him; Goofus wounds Hammond and, seeing he has not killed him, starts a forest fire. Jim, who has escaped from prison with the aid of his friend, Buddy, rescues Virginia from the burning lodge; Goofus confesses to the murder, and Jim is freed.","popularity":1.6544,"poster_path":"/xKrfGMbHM2lBh54h5YCcVraFVmP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tiffany Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lodge in the Wilderness","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1393409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Stewart","original_name":"Anita Stewart","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/kKJmhV2idh4ybNn8869HxsMO37y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Virginia Coulson","credit_id":"5d22c8a36d4c973916763b97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Burns","original_name":"Edmund Burns","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":"/nm91OSyVUWeegGhh1yCuwkpj7a8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jim Wallace","credit_id":"5d22c8aaef4889581ae9c4df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duane Thompson","original_name":"Duane Thompson","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":"/LziG2AJPCXtIeRMpEvcTha3ZMV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dot Marshall","credit_id":"5d22c8b1ef4889581ae9c4ec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Steers","original_name":"Larry Steers","popularity":0.1621,"profile_path":"/8QBHXihnGldVMNIxnbW2ljTk7Y1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"John Hammond","credit_id":"5d22c8b915c6367558f53c34","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Potel","original_name":"Victor Potel","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/obZCOU7xnxvlkLLfHtlZPs3EB3Q.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Goofus","credit_id":"5d22c8bf94d8a8498445454f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eddie Lyons","original_name":"Eddie Lyons","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/fYf7CyV9OkfEoyFEMrINiQGlZMa.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Buddy O'Brien","credit_id":"5d22c8c6b4a5430012bcdfac","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Farley","original_name":"Jim Farley","popularity":0.4315,"profile_path":"/155ugk9VWe00T7wWSo3pqb9b80d.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bill Duncan","credit_id":"5d22c8d0b4a543204ebbc893","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":32575,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henry McCarty","original_name":"Henry McCarty","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d138f189251416e14b87477","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106106,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jack MacKenzie","original_name":"Jack MacKenzie","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8fe39d66a7c3001989d234","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":33692,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wyndham Gittens","original_name":"Wyndham Gittens","popularity":0.1745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8fe3836728a8000f8b0b68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1592514,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gilbert Parker","original_name":"Gilbert Parker","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8fe38f6728a8000f8b0b6c","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0017074","wikidata_id":"Q64830590","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":874,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xKrfGMbHM2lBh54h5YCcVraFVmP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":585},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":828,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kEAfEWiNRLCKZNj2wZgRSHFq1UM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":552}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":337103,"name":"preserved at the eye film institute netherlands"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1927-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1926-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
