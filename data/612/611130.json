This was one of the first features ever directed by King and it was so successful that Pathé asked the original production company, Balboa, for five more features with the same child wonder. All were produced during the second half of 1916, and only three of them survive today – one being Twin Kiddies, which shows the amazing progress King had made since the first film in the series. Of course, the story is thin, the ending quite abrupt, and the opening sequences rather long. Yet, the direction is much more subtle, alternating between shots of different size, suggesting that King was mastering the art of composition.","popularity":0.1604,"poster_path":"/iasZESpHzx7uEPWq8XyJuglNLr8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twin Kiddies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Osborne","original_name":"Marie Osborne","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":"/wTRnWxig4IEwPg7faxqzlBNK3Y9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bessie Hunt/Fay Van Loan","credit_id":"5d120a5ac3a3681ab620ea1a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry King","original_name":"Henry King","popularity":0.3557,"profile_path":"/bJpytCyMCSpoM3wlN8ZkeqZlr2b.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jasper Hunt","credit_id":"5d120a76c3a36857301eea7e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Gilfether","original_name":"Daniel Gilfether","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/qo9E6W2hVJwpvW52IEZ5xyUEcgc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"William Van Loan","credit_id":"5d120a8bc3a36857301eea9c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2347322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Lackaye","original_name":"Ruth Lackaye","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs Flannigan","credit_id":"5d120a9e0e0a261e56cb9931","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Jobson","original_name":"Edward Jobson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nrrIQoD10D5dHbsVkcXeigAOWB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Spencer","credit_id":"5d120aaa0e0a2602a1d22bda","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mignon Le Brun","original_name":"Mignon Le Brun","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Governess","credit_id":"5d120ab49251417378b8bafc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"R.
