Appleton hires Dale, who, through his winning manner, soon wins the respect of the ranch hands and the love of the ranch owner's daughter Mary Jane. Believing himself unworthy of her, Dale tells Mary Jane that he has a wife and child in Arizona, and she reluctantly agrees to marry Jack Nelda, a local rancher. Nelda realizes that Mary Jane is still in love with Dale and plots with Bessie Dupont and her brother Pinto to kill him.","popularity":0.2059,"poster_path":"/eq8pkhVw88XcokqDHRq5abtYDF3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1918-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hungry Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monroe Salisbury","original_name":"Monroe Salisbury","popularity":0.0775,"profile_path":"/g3wjqIubbtXqCpkzzJvOnj5bsHc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dale Revenal","credit_id":"5ef2c25c2b21080035900656","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":217748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Clifford","original_name":"Ruth Clifford","popularity":0.266,"profile_path":"/l5x0tNNX59PmF03566UqNu140OT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mary Jane Appleton","credit_id":"5ef2c262967cc7003445d5ba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rupert Julian","original_name":"Rupert Julian","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/9dWgryyjsLz1dw9cxMNvuB5piEh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Silver","credit_id":"5ef2c2689cc67b0036bbe770","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.H.
