But the Golden State is bankrupt and the city of Los Angeles is running out of cash. Public services are being cut and unemployment keeps rising. At the same time, optimism, entrepreneurship and the belief in the power of America are stronger than ever.  In Los Angeles, we meet five people who are going through a transformation in their lives during this crisis. Justin and Christine lost their jobs and are now living in a van with their two young sons. Charles has gotten out of prison after fourteen years. Mizuko prepares her children for the future by making them at ease in virtual reality. Laura has taken advantage of the crisis by buying land cheaply and starting an urban farm and artists collective Fallen Fruit maps the abundant free 'public fruit' available in the city. Who are the pioneers who are reinventing the new America and how do they see the future?","popularity":0.0676,"poster_path":"/5FHo8UIlAlcg8mro0sHaqxuixny.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21880,"logo_path":null,"name":"VPRO Backlight","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"California Dreaming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bregtje van der Haak","original_name":"Bregtje van der Haak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d159cf418b751002d5d0e96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2764664","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b7ytUHe1aVFIO0oYbxmhadFRB5I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5FHo8UIlAlcg8mro0sHaqxuixny.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
