In his absence, his little daughter Joan is raised by mine superintendent Robert Carter. Many years after her father's conviction, Joan receives an anonymous note advising her to examine the contents of a chest that is stored in a certain warehouse. Carter, alarmed by this development, tries to secure the trunk himself, but not before it is purchased at an auction by Jim Younger and his friends. Joan, who loves Jim, informs the young man of the chest's value, and when Carter and his men steal the box, Jim pursues them and retrieves it.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1918-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl Who Wouldn't Quit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0009110","wikidata_id":"Q3987257","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1918-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
