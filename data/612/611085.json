The young people who come to work in Abidjan often form spontaneous associations for mutual help and entertainment, which are called \"Goumbés\" in Ivory Coast, after the name of a square drum that serves as the rhythmic base to their dance. During a general meeting, the secretary of the association reads the statutes, and it is these statutes that serve as both the backdrop and the commentary of the film.","popularity":0.2731,"poster_path":"/3SQOZHK9caNzoaMS5pSGnSFBwhB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114154,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)","origin_country":""},{"id":745,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la Pléiade","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Goumbé of the Young Revelers","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Rouch","original_name":"Jean Rouch","popularity":0.2114,"profile_path":"/808sK0h9rZ5ljP2bOxyyvLmbDn7.jpg","credit_id":"648601f599259c00ff0f31dc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Rouch","original_name":"Jean Rouch","popularity":0.2114,"profile_path":"/808sK0h9rZ5ljP2bOxyyvLmbDn7.jpg","credit_id":"648601fc028f1400c7da210f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133672,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie Tresgot","original_name":"Annie Tresgot","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6486021bbf31f25054b66025","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18196,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre Braunberger","original_name":"Pierre Braunberger","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d11165ec3a3680d491e3703","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Rouch","original_name":"Jean Rouch","popularity":0.2114,"profile_path":"/808sK0h9rZ5ljP2bOxyyvLmbDn7.jpg","credit_id":"5d1115d5c3a36809b21fce52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0210080","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2558,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3SQOZHK9caNzoaMS5pSGnSFBwhB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
