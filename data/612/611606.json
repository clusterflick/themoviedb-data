Harsh realities and fantastic illusions come together in BLACK MAGIC FOR WHITE BOYS, Onur Tukelâ€™s latest film, a bizarre comic adventure about gentrification, race and bodily autonomy in New York City. With over 50 minutes of new footage, Tukel has completely reworked a project initially presented in 2017 as a four-episode series at Tribeca into a gnarly and charmingly weird dark comedy. Balancing edgy misanthropy with a strain of silly sweetness, this is an intimate low-budget parable about the changing face of New York City.","popularity":1.303,"poster_path":"/85Ip8M76pPY7RHI1JyHLb73Cytr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black
