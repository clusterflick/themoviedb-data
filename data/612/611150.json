There he meets old buddy Raul (Leo Masliah), who is now a priest. The story opens out to bring in their schooldays 20 years earlier, during Argentina’s politically active ’70s, when Raul was going out with Tamara (Victoria de Elizalde), who now lives in Paris with husband Paul (Ginger Poujoulet). The mature Tamara (Laura Melillo) returns to be with her sick mother, and Marcos unwittingly stumbles across some high-level politico-economic corruption on the part of the lab’s owners, led by Dr. Castembacher (Jean Pierre Reguerraz). In a piece in which perfs win out over plot, Garzon is satisfyingly nuanced as the disillusioned Marcos. Technically, pic’s restricted budget makes itself felt.","popularity":0.1659,"poster_path":"/4KACXdNc2wnrY2Szak5jH50cj6u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2000-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How silly are to grow up","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustavo Garzón","original_name":"Gustavo Garzón","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/nB4cWI8JQF01chqNtqxt9NTg8np.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marcos","credit_id":"5d117762c3a36811ee1fd41f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":941750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Melillo","original_name":"Laura Melillo","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tamara","credit_id":"5d1179990e0a26641ac9af35","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607245,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leo Masliah","original_name":"Leo Masliah","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Raúl","credit_id":"5d1179bdc3a36809b2208586","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Pierre Reguerraz","original_name":"Jean Pierre Reguerraz","popularity":0.0587,"profile_path":"/v8msXaHmvXBkwTiTeNd6F8NXWH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Castembacher","credit_id":"5d1179ddc3a3681ab61ffcaa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":995616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damián Dreizik","original_name":"Damián Dreizik","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/dqiMFxYBWO8D500mwGu4R0P0aVe.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"hijo","credit_id":"5d117a11c3a368546e1de5b1","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2075130,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Patricia Conta","original_name":"Patricia Conta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d117be59251411ac6b84e3f","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1997429,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fernando Soldevilla","original_name":"Fernando Soldevilla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d117cc30e0a26597dcb9476","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347142,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fouillade, Pablo","original_name":"Fouillade, Pablo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d117c91925141076ab93006","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347140,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pablo Jamardo","original_name":"Pablo Jamardo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d117c26c3a368546e1de90e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347141,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mariano Pariz","original_name":"Mariano Pariz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d117c480e0a262177cb9332","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1836558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roly Santos","original_name":"Roly Santos","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/sHHz078yIcUY7w5sKosnGkIFB1R.jpg","credit_id":"5d1182a5c3a36812811fad46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hernán Guerschuny","original_name":"Hernán Guerschuny","popularity":0.0884,"profile_path":"/lZXlQ4ou691JkeyvUzPvOr8uCTQ.jpg","credit_id":"5d117abe0e0a26641ac9b059","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0270593","wikidata_id":"Q50327125","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":834,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4KACXdNc2wnrY2Szak5jH50cj6u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":594}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2000-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"IFF FESTIVAL","release_date":"2000-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2000-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
