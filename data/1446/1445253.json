Erin Krakow, Daniel Lissing and Lori Loughlin star in When Calls the Heart: Heart and Home. Jack and Elizabeth leave Hope Valley and rush back to the city of Hamilton when they learn that Jacks' brother, Tom, was involved in an automobile accident…with Elizabeth's sister, Julie! But Tom and Julie are hiding something about the incident, a deceit that puts Jack and Elizabeth at odds with their families…and with each other. Their trip is further complicated when Tom and Julie endeavor to run off together—via train this time—and Elizabeth's father offers Jack a job—an offer that puts Jack and Elizabeth's fledgling romance in peril yet again.","popularity":0.953,"poster_path":"/zRc21RBhyL6yrbHSJxdy9ogMVuI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Calls The Heart: Heart And Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1143960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erin Krakow","original_name":"Erin Krakow","popularity":1.2207,"profile_path":"/8euXiEHmBwzV6NdwQ8dfwzFa7C7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Elizabeth Thornton","credit_id":"67cca1b942c7521252f5c433","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lori Loughlin","original_name":"Lori Loughlin","popularity":1.2071,"profile_path":"/uelwtzItSLYEgaSjfzxfQ1AE1YK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Abigail Stanton","credit_id":"67cca1cc2fe71b8c45f5b295","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Wagner","original_name":"Jack Wagner","popularity":0.8012,"profile_path":"/zRoZShStnWymvcm7bQDr35qdck6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bill Avery","credit_id":"67cca1e9ed64be9833f587b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1256300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Lissing","original_name":"Daniel Lissing","popularity":0.8404,"profile_path":"/8BN5A6PuzkjPdiT9zlDYDuMvlC4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jack Thornton","credit_id":"67cca1ffe9461adf414f9afe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Cummins","original_name":"Martin Cummins","popularity":0.5681,"profile_path":"/gnc1YUrHiYciRWB4ZCJFk9boAHg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Henry Gowen","credit_id":"67cca21542c7521252f5c440","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Wood","original_name":"Martin Wood","popularity":0.5228,"profile_path":"/qQP6R8DbFNtzPkCNkABMJN9LraP.jpg","credit_id":"67cca22bf23e9940105bb978","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neill Fearnley","original_name":"Neill Fearnley","popularity":0.5518,"profile_path":"/9dFT0XWxrtwZLki8YjbaWlXHQUf.jpg","credit_id":"67cca23d9a3f7013fa4f9617","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Landon Jr.","original_name":"Michael Landon Jr.","popularity":0.668,"profile_path":"/lVxLh0r9zyFnm4z58PGfmmcPbTn.jpg","credit_id":"67cca29c42c7521252f5c4c3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2103894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Stevens","original_name":"Andrea Stevens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cca2eb05adfb9eb95bc73a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":107440,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Janette Oke","original_name":"Janette Oke","popularity":0.1518,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cca2fd2fe71b8c45f5b2b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1365,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zRc21RBhyL6yrbHSJxdy9ogMVuI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":912}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
