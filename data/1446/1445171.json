The Healing Heart of Lushootseed, a short documentary film tells the extraordinary story of how a diminutive great grandmother gathered support for her most ambitious project yet, to heal the heart of the world through music.  On May 20th, 2006, Seattle’s Benaroya Hall was filled to capacity for the world premiere of The Healing Heart of the First People of this Land, an orchestral work in four movements, by Canadian composer Bruce Ruddell, performed by the Seattle Symphony and mezzo soprano Jenny Knapp, conducted by Maestro Gerard Schwarz. Vi believed the Symphony should be performed around the world. The Healing Heart Project seeks to fulfill her vision.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/jD4LVsmTARBEzWRCKQVvlvawoKt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Healing Heart of Lushootseed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5290940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vi Hilbert","original_name":"Vi Hilbert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67cc78c1cb18486ea15b8611","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186459,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruce Ruddell","original_name":"Bruce Ruddell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67cc78e29ef0acdb8b5bb060","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5290949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerard Schwarz","original_name":"Gerard Schwarz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67cc7925ed64be9833f583ea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5290953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jill K.
