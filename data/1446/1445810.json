A journey backwards in time, where we retrace the history of the universe towards the mystery of its origin. The film tells the story of two parallel spaces. That of a woman and a mysterious source of light. Attracted by the source, the woman tries to seize it. But the light, in perpetual transformation, remains elusive. The closer she gets, the more its transformations make her tremble, as if she's tuninig into tis energsy. The two words begin to interact, blending into one another in a chorography of connection, until the ultimate pulse in unison, merging space into a single entity.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":81742,"logo_path":"/yKTWAk8VV0g0V01el5wMLNvDTvm.png","name":"JPL Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Hundred Thousand Kilometers per Second","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
