Guth sees Calaf, son of the fugitive Tartar king Timur, »thrown into a world that he cannot understand«. It is a system that functions according to its own logic: Princess Turandot, in order to protect herself, has built a bureaucratic apparatus around her that is as brutal as it is effective. For director Claus Guth, it is clear that Turandot is describing her own experience when she speaks of the terrible things done to her ancestor Lu-o-lin; the terror state is her reaction. The stage by Etienne Pluss, the costumes by Ursula Krdina and the choreography by Sommer Ulricksen show it from the outside as well as the inside - and also its decay, which is the necessary prerequisite for Turandot and Calaf's happy ending.","popularity":0.0922,"poster_path":"/uuaDET3OlW07eWiE6QT31i3rgCd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72205,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wiener Staatsoper","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Wiener Staatsoper","title":"Turandot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1344438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asmik Grigorian","original_name":"Asmik Grigorian","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/1OSKsFOKC3cUq6H1yb2tWfHWNzM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Turandot","credit_id":"67cd7e9af9a48698e2e2c764","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Kaufmann","original_name":"Jonas Kaufmann","popularity":0.1929,"profile_path":"/phtOzy9kcTClC9mU7N6Mr2q1yFV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Calaf","credit_id":"67cd7eb4ff1a840b9910e1d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristina Mkhitaryan","original_name":"Kristina Mkhitaryan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Liu","credit_id":"67cd7f388d0c44cf8f10dfd0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5292463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jörg Schneider","original_name":"Jörg Schneider","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Altoum","credit_id":"67cd7f0b8d0c44cf8f10dfaa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Paul Dumitrescu","original_name":"Dan Paul Dumitrescu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Timur","credit_id":"67cd7f223c25444882e2c7b9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Häßler","original_name":"Martin Häßler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ping","credit_id":"67cd7f642794b0d5982a73d3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norbert Ernst","original_name":"Norbert Ernst","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Pang","credit_id":"67cd7f758d0c44cf8f10dff5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5292465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroshi Amako","original_name":"Hiroshi Amako","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Pong","credit_id":"67cd7f82856e13cb3d10de61","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382764,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marco Armiliato","original_name":"Marco Armiliato","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"67cd7fe42794b0d5982a73f7","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claus Guth","original_name":"Claus Guth","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cd7fa759ae03efe32a74ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":958346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giacomo Puccini","original_name":"Giacomo Puccini","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/mAVi1Op8QWvu6QC63nb6tn1MXDm.jpg","credit_id":"67cd7fd92794b0d5982a73ee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.742,"height":2346,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uuaDET3OlW07eWiE6QT31i3rgCd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1741}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
