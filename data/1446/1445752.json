A moving film about Sweden in transition from one reality to another in the tumultuous period of 2019-2022, the start of a new era. Gang-related murders, explosions, the birth of a new political scene with the right-wing nationalist Sweden Democrats, with roots in white power movement, gaining increasing influence, plus the pandemic and climate change as well as war in Europe. And through it all, we live our lives, whilst big changes take place quietly. A film about a changing Sweden beyond the headlines.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2025-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When something big happens, it happens quietly","title":"Land of Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Satumaan jäljillä","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2134788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirsi Nevanti","original_name":"Kirsi Nevanti","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/mFmhzjcmDUFWDbWtiCykTcFitDA.jpg","credit_id":"67cddce7ad486b43ebe2df59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"S","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tampere Film Festival","release_date":"2025-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
