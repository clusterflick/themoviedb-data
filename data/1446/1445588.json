The libretto and score were written in a month in December 1789, and the premiere took place at the end of January 1790, but the death of the Emperor interrupted the run after five performances. This Neapolitan-style comedy (the action is set in Naples!), but very much inspired by French comic opera, and in particular by Femmes Vengées composed by Philidor in 1775 to a libretto by Sedaine (which was performed in Vienna), where two women wanting to teach their husbands a lesson exchange their roles by cross-dressing… in order to seduce them and confuse them better! Twenty years later, Mozart and Da Ponte found exceptional inspiration for this comedy of manners in the spirit of Marivaux, where love, beauty and cruelty are subtly intertwined, until all hell breaks loose for some anthological moments!","popularity":0.0559,"poster_path":"/nA5cRKu9K0LQzK9cRkSxdxeOeGI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":255718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opera Royal de Versailles","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":174,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Opera Royal de Versailles","title":"Cosi Fan Tutte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Maria Labin","original_name":"Ana Maria Labin","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Fiordiligi","credit_id":"67cd8f1b2794b0d5982a76de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Brower","original_name":"Angela Brower","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ihoumeEFXZOmxCTeW0X2nhbp3FX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dorabella","credit_id":"67cd8f2af9a48698e2e2cb49","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3974246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Albano","original_name":"Miriam Albano","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Despina","credit_id":"67cd8f3c856e13cb3d10e118","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5292589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Ley","original_name":"James Ley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ferrando","credit_id":"67cd8f63ad486b43ebe2ca2e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian Sempey","original_name":"Florian Sempey","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/zIox1mOuEeWMNIulXzq9apCqMPm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Guglielmo","credit_id":"67cd8f748d0c44cf8f10e320","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3072069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Duhamel","original_name":"Alexandre Duhamel","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Don Alfonso","credit_id":"67cd8f8af9a48698e2e2cb50","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Minkowski","original_name":"Marc Minkowski","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/o5Az1vnk5zowbyj37xLwNqYMmB7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"67cd8fa1a8b335257e2a77e8","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1183,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"67cd8fb4f9a48698e2e2cb55","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2468552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Alexandre","original_name":"Ivan Alexandre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cd8fc475c9f1bd12e2cac3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":2334,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nA5cRKu9K0LQzK9cRkSxdxeOeGI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1552}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
