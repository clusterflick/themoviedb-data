The dramatic essence of Shakespeare runs in the veins of this Rigoletto, although the story is based on the controversial Le roi s’amuse by Victor Hugo. While the play was prohibited in France for more than fifty years, Verdi himself fought with the censors who initially prevented the publication of his opera. Multi-faceted, perhaps more than any other opera by Verdi - tender, cruel, interspersed with remarkable strokes of black humour -, Rigoletto is also a heart-wrenching study about the love between a parent and a child. Given the helplessness of a woman in the face of a group of men, Teatro Real’s production, which is directed by Miguel del Arco, also considers society's concept of masculinity. Nicola Luisotti conducts some of the great voices of our day, including Javier Camarena, Ludovic Tézier, Marina Viotti and Adela Zaharia.","popularity":0.2016,"poster_path":"/iQAWsFRc6mHoQmdjbgQnApdciFx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro Real de Madrid","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Teatro Real","title":"Rigoletto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Camarena","original_name":"Javier Camarena","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Duke of Mantua","credit_id":"67cd9576a8b335257e2a7a4a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1267405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludovic Tézier","original_name":"Ludovic Tézier","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/u9OD8isxAGK1oLJBs2HSHFCYo07.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rigoletto","credit_id":"67cd95898d0c44cf8f10e52c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2766913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adela Zaharia","original_name":"Adela Zaharia","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gilda","credit_id":"67cd9598856e13cb3d10e27f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5292631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peixin Chen","original_name":"Peixin Chen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sparafucile","credit_id":"67cd95af75c9f1bd12e2cc6b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4379469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Viotti","original_name":"Marina Viotti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/BJxe2IlXnkqdm6TRXUKctdter8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maddalena","credit_id":"67cd95c78d0c44cf8f10e54a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cassandre Berthon","original_name":"Cassandre Berthon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Giovanna","credit_id":"67cd95d8f9a48698e2e2cd2a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3604420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Shanahan","original_name":"Jordan Shanahan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Count Monterone","credit_id":"67cd95e7856e13cb3d10e2b1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3091059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"César San Martín","original_name":"César San Martín","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Marullo","credit_id":"67cd95fa2bd21c806f10e386","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5292634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabián Lara","original_name":"Fabián Lara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Matteo Borsa","credit_id":"67cd961646d50f08cf2a756b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomeu Bibiloni","original_name":"Tomeu Bibiloni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Count Ceprano","credit_id":"67cd962675c9f1bd12e2cc9e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Pastrana","original_name":"Sandra Pastrana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Countess Ceprano","credit_id":"67cd9635ad486b43ebe2cb69","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicola Luisotti","original_name":"Nicola Luisotti","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":"/5ftZkFCdlaXQuFrncdLdy1hWmFy.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"67cd9646ad486b43ebe2cb6f","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"67cd9656856e13cb3d10e2e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel del Arco","original_name":"Miguel del Arco","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cd966a2794b0d5982a78a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2346,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iQAWsFRc6mHoQmdjbgQnApdciFx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
