His rental application just got denied, he can't bring himself to text his mother back, he's going to be late to the end of year party and - oh yeah, he's sporting a black eye from some asshole using his head for batting practice. It's ok though. Nothing a little alcohol and nicotine can't solve. At the party Adrian indulges himself quietly in a corner, unanswered texts in hand. His mother says he can come home - if he gets the help she thinks he needs. His problem? The guy he just can't keep out of his mind and the clock is ticking down to the end of the semester. His best friend Cassie tries to do the impossible: get Adrian to focus on his looming housing situation before he winds up on the street.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vIWD8H99pm8dXNCIdVxxGYUmzxu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whifflebat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5293089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bran Sullivan","original_name":"Bran Sullivan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67cdc8f33c25444882e2d26b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5293091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wren Halpern","original_name":"Wren Halpern","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67cdc8f946d50f08cf2a8689","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5293085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lexy Vecchio","original_name":"Lexy Vecchio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cdc8cf8d0c44cf8f10f05d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5293085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lexy Vecchio","original_name":"Lexy Vecchio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cdc8d72bd21c806f10fcb1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35956667","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vIWD8H99pm8dXNCIdVxxGYUmzxu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
