Weeks later, suffering from insomnia and survivor's guilt, Sara begins taking a powerful prescription sleep aid. However, the medication causes her to experience a series of vivid dreams in which she meets with Jean - only this version of Jean is middle-aged and insistent that she survived...and Sara perished. Initially, Sara doubts that the woman is Jean, but soon becomes convinced that she speaks the truth. This prompts a need for Sara to find proof in her waking world that her friend is actually visiting her in dreams and not merely a drug-induced hallucination. Sara spends the remainder of the film attempting to prove that somehow, somewhere, Jean is still alive.","popularity":0.2053,"poster_path":"/aZ9RSPFqRzkuOd7UNBwVelnkrBj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Following the death of her best friend in a horrific automobile accident, sixteen-year-old Sara is visited in her dreams by a middle-aged woman from the future bearing a terrifying message: it was actually Sara who lost her life in the crash.","title":"Oh, the Guilt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Astin","original_name":"Sean Astin","popularity":2.8839,"profile_path":"/ywH1VvdwqlcnuwUVr0pV0HUZJQA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dormazestrin Spokesman","credit_id":"67cc957f8230b256f4f5b276","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5291161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahtab Zargari","original_name":"Mahtab Zargari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sara Mohammadi","credit_id":"67cc959cf23e9940105bb570","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2535429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Savanah Joeckel","original_name":"Savanah Joeckel","popularity":0.2095,"profile_path":"/yMTCTH5F0U8o8GIItR6hGJVmavx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jean Smith","credit_id":"67cc95c242c7521252f5c086","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5291165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilda Graham","original_name":"Gilda Graham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Doctor Bedrosian","credit_id":"67cc961d9a3f7013fa4f913d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4898535,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heela Naqshband","original_name":"Heela Naqshband","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nasrin Mohammadi","credit_id":"67cc966a8230b256f4f5b2cd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2015114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shahab Zargari","original_name":"Shahab Zargari","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e6d0c009252862ea767562","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2596701,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ryan Galvan","original_name":"Ryan Galvan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e6d0d2f5b55956d6493f68","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14128550","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aZ9RSPFqRzkuOd7UNBwVelnkrBj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
