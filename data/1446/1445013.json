Sorensen produced the video for TV Tubes using a Rutt/Etra synthesiser (raster scan modulator) and Grass Valley Switcher at the WNET TV Lab in New York City. She performed the video synthesizer live and recorded it in real-time. Sorensen created the music immediately afterwards, considering the video as a dynamic score for her original composition, which was realized on a large Moog synthesizer housed at the Electronic Music Studios in the Music Department at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany. The music and video were combined at the WNET TV Lab. TV Tubes has been exhibited many times in performance, on television and cable in the 1980s, and at conferences and exhibitions since it was completed.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rugxJFpllwr6PPxygyenpIvbuy2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TV Tubes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5290440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vibeke Sorensen","original_name":"Vibeke Sorensen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cc2ae17c70c42a034f7e2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.757,"height":2053,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rugxJFpllwr6PPxygyenpIvbuy2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
