(Hilda Doolittle)—Helen in Egypt (1955) and Tribute to Freud (1944)—as source material. Narrated by Jonas, Lines in the Sand transposes H.D.'s re-working of the story of Helen of Troy to present-day Las Vegas, with the Luxor Hotel as a key motif. This 47-minute video is a document of Jonas' layered theatrical performance, which features the artist and performers interacting with large-scale video projections, ritualized objects and a rich sound collage. An exploration of the liberation of the self, Lines in the Sand (created in 2002, just prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq) also references contemporary political realities; the title echoes the first President Bush's declaration to Saddam Hussein at the start of the Gulf War.  Work based on 'Helen in Egypt,' a poem by H.D. (Hilda Doolittle).\" –KG","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lines in the Sand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1309429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Jonas","original_name":"Joan Jonas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/8rvC6EidwNnIVQvQgjmVdVNbTrp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67ce7614856e13cb3d110dbf","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
