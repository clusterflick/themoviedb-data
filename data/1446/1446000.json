The President of the Republic of Finland makes state visits all over the world and travels frequently in Finland. The President's spouse Sylvi Kekkonen is also featured in the documentary. The President also comes to Tampere in July 1961, when King Olav of Norway visits Finland. President Kekkonen's first term was a time of many crises, but they are not really featured in the film. Instead, the ending is heartwarming: Urho picks a fallen autumn leaf from the ground and hands it to Sylvi.","popularity":0.0671,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1961-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urho Kekkonen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Urho Kekkonen","original_name":"Urho Kekkonen","popularity":0.3354,"profile_path":"/8IuQR3g2AGGVlIy7Vx1rsBDznLb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ceb2f7856e13cb3d111e06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4616245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvi Kekkonen","original_name":"Sylvi Kekkonen","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ceb30253282c9de62a6d80","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2126721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Lewing","original_name":"Harry Lewing","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cea1e2ff1a840b9911173b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3522441,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Allan Pyykkö","original_name":"Allan Pyykkö","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cea1f82794b0d5982ab253","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1303592,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orvo Saarikivi","original_name":"Orvo Saarikivi","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/vjuQbjI7DHcBkBJXJYOpLx66CJ5.jpg","credit_id":"67cea20a3c25444882e302b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793460,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Armas Laurinen","original_name":"Armas Laurinen","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cea21905da1a9e15e2b9f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
