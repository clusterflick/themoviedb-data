The Rutt/Etra synthesizer allows one to alter the height, width, depth, and the horizontal and vertical amplitude of the raster. The resultant image is displayed on a cathode ray tube and rescanned by a black and white camera which then enters a video switcher for adding outlines, color, wipes, or other images. I chose outlines and color for Temple , for simplicity but also because I only had two hands and could not modify everything at once.","popularity":0.057,"poster_path":"/5RoEf4jcpOMPKv6FILMqJFokRty.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Temple","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5290440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vibeke Sorensen","original_name":"Vibeke Sorensen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cc2b5b8230b256f4f5a2ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":2216,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5RoEf4jcpOMPKv6FILMqJFokRty.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
