But the heat is so intense that he becomes drowsy, and finally he is lulled to sleep by the murmur of the gently flowing current of the stream. His rest is disturbed by strange dreams, and as a result of a sudden movement he pitches into the water. A policeman who happens to be passing at this moment rushes to his aid, but the angler has already gained the shore before assistance reaches him, and the latter immediately starts to return to his house to change his clothes. During that time, the policeman, who has jumped into the river, is overtaken by two officers, who arrest him, thinking that he has been bathing in a place where it is forbidden. They lead the poor man away to the station-house without concerning themselves about the fact that he is a representative of the public force.","popularity":0.0534,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1905-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Angler's Nightmare, or A Policeman's Troubles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.1982,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"67cd4de5f9a48698e2e2bd74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0228123","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1905-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
