Although known around the world, no french museum had yet dared to acquire any of Dubuffet's work.The twisting suspenseful drama is told through the fascinating correspondence between Jean Dubuffet, René Deroudille and collage artist Philippe Dereux, intermediary between the painter and the art critic at the time.
