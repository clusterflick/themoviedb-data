Yet like most German army officers, Claus Schenk, Count von Stauffenberg, was at first a fascinated observer of Hitler's rise and his early military successes. He, too, was carried away by the triumph of the French campaign. It was a long road for this loyal follower of his commander-in-chief to become the man who tried to kill the Fuhrer on 20 July 1944. So what turned an ambitious officer from an old aristocratic family into the mastermind of a coup d'etat? What did he know about the crimes committed under the Nazi regime? Based on the latest research about the German Resistance, this documentary seeks to answer these questions.","popularity":0.0578,"poster_path":"/lOWv4SauFDvscTN3R9IrET1D6ED.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Bravest Attempt on Hilter's Life","title":"Stauffenberg: The True Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mission to Murder Hitler","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Stauffenberg - Die wahre Geschichte","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Halmburger","original_name":"Oliver Halmburger","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ccb9669ef0acdb8b5bbdb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lOWv4SauFDvscTN3R9IrET1D6ED.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
