It depicts animals, birds and insects as its protagonists instead of human beings. These animals engage in a soundless dialogue with each other as a letter passes through the film’s frame repeatedly. There are humans portrayed in Shocking Dreams as well and as their behaviours become increasingly animalistic, the behaviours of the animals become ever more human-like. Eventually, the line between the two groups begins to blur.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shocking Dreams in the Circus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1478446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sun Xun","original_name":"Sun Xun","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jOcbmTGHCsLnwbUNmk1DZOJsbZM.jpg","credit_id":"67cc3b8842c7521252f5ac2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
