Despite his seemingly timid appearance, the young sovereign was determined. He would transform his country's economy, stand up to world leaders like General de Gaulle and billionaire Onassis, and succeed in putting Monaco on the map. Using audio recordings, the sovereign himself narrates the significant milestones in his life, accompanied by narration from actress Fanny Ardant, who was his friend.","popularity":0.4728,"poster_path":"/4FnhZkJHJMosvQbzxKrN0MLpnxn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79509,"logo_path":null,"name":"Check
