Their gender identity had, until now, confined them to prostitution and precarious jobs. For the older adults they care for, they are the first trans women they interact with. For trans caregivers, this is a first encounter with old age: in Argentina, life expectancy for them does not exceed forty years. At that age, Jenifer, Fabiana and Abigail have their first formal jobs.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rkuPYciI83sVV6Ef6e9f82i0X6a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Care","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5293054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abigail de la Cruz","original_name":"Abigail de la Cruz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67cdc7072bd21c806f10fa2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5293056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabiana Cruz","original_name":"Fabiana Cruz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67cdc7112bd21c806f10fa45","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5293060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenifer Dutra","original_name":"Jenifer Dutra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67cdc72d2bd21c806f10fa68","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5293064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maia Antesana","original_name":"Maia Antesana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67cdc74146d50f08cf2a84f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5293065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yenifer Franco Pereira","original_name":"Yenifer Franco Pereira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67cdc75575c9f1bd12e2d618","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5293066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luciana Méndez","original_name":"Luciana Méndez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67cdc75f46d50f08cf2a852e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2517758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martina Matzkin","original_name":"Martina Matzkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5xd7NK881bjKBuKi8NszPnE4ZeC.jpg","credit_id":"67cdc6ce2794b0d5982a86f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3112492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriela Uassouf","original_name":"Gabriela Uassouf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cdc6da75c9f1bd12e2d60b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3112492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriela Uassouf","original_name":"Gabriela Uassouf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cdc6e82794b0d5982a8714","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36024870","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k25oAJTXkDMgXPAdyW7F3Bhaecr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/rkuPYciI83sVV6Ef6e9f82i0X6a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
