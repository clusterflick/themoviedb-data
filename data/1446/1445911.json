The arrangement of the visualization concentrates on what the music expresses and the emotions it brings forth. Thus, Gustav Mahler's cultural-historical setting and the sources of his own inspiration do not come into play in this visualization. This work is a matter of blending together two interpretations: one expressed musically and the other visually.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/jBStxzTpW59Du46gnggcJFJY2L9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":142244,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"What a world this is that brings forth such sounds and shapes as its reflected likeness!\" - Gustav Mahler","title":"Vision Mahler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"VIsion Mahler: Interactive Visualization of the Symphony No. 2 by Gustav Mahler \"Resurrection Symphony\"","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1633621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Semyon Bychkov","original_name":"Semyon Bychkov","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"67ce50c9856e13cb3d1107bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5294032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karina Gauvin","original_name":"Karina Gauvin","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Soprano","credit_id":"67ce544c2794b0d5982aa393","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Naef","original_name":"Yvonne Naef","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Alto","credit_id":"67ce54c18d0c44cf8f111418","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5294030,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Johannes Deutsch","original_name":"Johannes Deutsch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ce540459ae03efe32aa659","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5294041,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Horst Hörtner","original_name":"Horst Hörtner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ce568b856e13cb3d11091e","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5294042,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dr. Robert Abt","original_name":"Dr. Robert Abt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ce56b22bd21c806f110e5f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5294047,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Andreas Jalsovec","original_name":"Andreas Jalsovec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ce56f72794b0d5982aa478","department":"Visual Effects","job":"3D Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5294052,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Florian Berger","original_name":"Florian Berger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ce573c2bd21c806f110ea3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"3D Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5294053,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christopher Lindinger","original_name":"Christopher Lindinger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ce575a856e13cb3d110955","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5294059,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Pascal Maresch","original_name":"Pascal Maresch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ce57b42bd21c806f110ecd","department":"Visual Effects","job":"3D Sequence Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5294063,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Verena Mösenbichler","original_name":"Verena Mösenbichler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ce57df856e13cb3d11097d","department":"Sound","job":"Music Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/jBStxzTpW59Du46gnggcJFJY2L9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
