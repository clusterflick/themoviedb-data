When a new vagrant, The Stranger, arrives on the ranch and asks for work, Kennicke hires him on. Kennicke quickly realizes The Stranger is different from the other drifters who have met their fate on the ranch. He is smart and vital, and always seems to understand what Kennicke is thinking. It quickly becomes apparent that The Stranger might know more about Kennicke's murderous acts than seems possible. And soon, Kennicke realizes his own life might be in danger.","popularity":0.1745,"poster_path":"/wj8cOPNvWb4QkSKr6KQAGiT6Y6r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":225674,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silence Fiction Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dark secrets forge deadly bonds.","title":"Rivals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Rivals Movie","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luce Rains","original_name":"Luce Rains","popularity":0.7283,"profile_path":"/az7wB3HJNQ7T3TmDdZ3rIdZ6bxO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kennicke","credit_id":"6614b1c4a6a4c10162bd2e96","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arron Shiver","original_name":"Arron Shiver","popularity":0.3504,"profile_path":"/4qwbL4uqYELO2aMgizl2oqxzamI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Stranger","credit_id":"6614b1d6d18b24017c34c465","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4642641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Hunt","original_name":"Gene Hunt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Banker","credit_id":"6614b1ea0bb076018531d8af","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Quinn","original_name":"Sam Quinn","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/aF51TwJxnGSbEb8TD9lzduticro.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Drifter","credit_id":"6614b202982f74014b5fdfb6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1405602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Alexander","original_name":"Aaron Alexander","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6614b31a3d7454016207b700","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1405602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Alexander","original_name":"Aaron Alexander","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6614b3535437f501647e01bd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4642646,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nick Heeb","original_name":"Nick Heeb","popularity":0.1186,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6614b36ed18b240163340e7b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30275038","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o6Zo4eOtokV8Wzznwghcx4qeARd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wj8cOPNvWb4QkSKr6KQAGiT6Y6r.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
