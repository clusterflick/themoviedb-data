This 'video' was screened for public audiences the same year of its production. And in March of 1987, it was displayed on television sets as a 'video installation' during the \"Wen Pulin 1987 Art Exhibition.\" It is one of the earliest examples of video art in China.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/oRTNI0I07xf3824a4g92aBjkJrB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Timon of Athens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2326741,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wen Pulin","original_name":"Wen Pulin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/n2DnyKuGwSmMiJd9ditrotStUwG.jpg","credit_id":"6612e1d0a6a4c10186bc1cd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4900061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zheng Ziru","original_name":"Zheng Ziru","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c80dafe5e00d22f5caa179","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1074,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oRTNI0I07xf3824a4g92aBjkJrB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":713}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
