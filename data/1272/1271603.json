The story is told by the same characters, each a mirror of human pettiness, positioned on the empty stage of a theater. After a peaceful start to the story, which revolves around the organization of a variety show, each character will discover his real identity by showing the drift of values and feelings in a context of ruthless self-sufficiency. A three-part series to see without using the quick scrolling function (like all Salieri's films) to get involved in the narrative and eroticism and appreciate the fantastic musical interventions of the orchestra conductor Antonello Cascone, musician by Andrea Bocelli and many other international stars.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nBb6ZssXM3nsU7bloyJ1C5Y8HLl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burlesque Show","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2360044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Jackson","original_name":"Josephine Jackson","popularity":3.494,"profile_path":"/glhJ6lBkQzY5yI8kwWU206aXMjN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6613f5158ee0a9017ea43134","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2382234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Miller","original_name":"Cristina Miller","popularity":1.614,"profile_path":"/kc54dAmLqxwScwVAVGTS5iubgSP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6613f521982f74014b5fbe64","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4342399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anica Russouw","original_name":"Anica Russouw","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6613f52e59008601627d118f","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4256934,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Erik Brunner","original_name":"Erik Brunner","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6613f54c3d7454018507e85c","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4427751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matteo Linux","original_name":"Matteo Linux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6613f5568ee0a9017ea43173","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":138339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Salieri","original_name":"Mario Salieri","popularity":9.946,"profile_path":"/rnB8IYIbiPgLHpsmKAkACLxrXFf.jpg","credit_id":"6613f504e10f460163393423","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nBb6ZssXM3nsU7bloyJ1C5Y8HLl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
