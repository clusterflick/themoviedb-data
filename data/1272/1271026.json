The processes of social disunity, the habit of everyday fear in some, and the impunity of others. The processes of internal migration and reinforcement of self-censorship, the reign of nonsense and meaninglessness. The process of destruction and simultaneous revival of the Belarusian language and culture. The processes of denigration of human dignity and creation of those guilty without the proof of their guilt. Processes of inflating militaristic sentiments and hatred of foreigners and dissenters. The process of Russia’s taking over Belarus and dragging it into a senseless war.","popularity":0.0727,"poster_path":"/3RkDB5PKgjgkVbDAmm9aQSaYW0O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117526,"logo_path":"/iKueQHLIkBg9NsBHV09z2srKu2B.png","name":"Belsat TV","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2022-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Brave new world: dark dystopian satire, Belarusian style.
