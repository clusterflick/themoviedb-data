This was later shown at the Odeon Theatre, Leicester Square in London. The theatre's projectors had to be unbolted from the floor and moved to properly screen the film.  The Canadian Pavilion at HemisFair '68, in San Antonio, Texas, also featured this film.  It presents Canadaâ€™s English, Scottish and French colonial settler heritages, but notably excludes any Indigenous participation in the formation of the nation. Each identity is enacted through an upright piano engaged in a discordant, dueling piano cacophony.","popularity":0.0921,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Canada Is My Piano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Dunning","original_name":"George Dunning","popularity":0.1046,"profile_path":"/rBbcT2sk2K8ZoDoVuCzk2opZbTa.jpg","credit_id":"661427f68ee0a9014ba3ac86","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Dunning","original_name":"George Dunning","popularity":0.1046,"profile_path":"/rBbcT2sk2K8ZoDoVuCzk2opZbTa.jpg","credit_id":"66142717a6a4c10162bce158","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Dunning","original_name":"George Dunning","popularity":0.1046,"profile_path":"/rBbcT2sk2K8ZoDoVuCzk2opZbTa.jpg","credit_id":"66142845ac617c017db1c018","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5066096","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
