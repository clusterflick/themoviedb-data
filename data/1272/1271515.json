The pretext of being strangers, the darkly comic ritual that the broken, non-functioning brothers perform in an attempt to get at their pain, can't cover the palpable connection between them, nor their deeply felt desire to find redemption.  An accomplished pianist, Jay is working as a piano player in a lounge. Mike, one of the bar's patrons, makes a request for Jay to play Maurice Ravel's \"Pavane pour une infant defunte\", which Jay refuses. This act masks an underlying secret both men share about their childhood.","popularity":0.5014,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":225605,"logo_path":null,"name":"BookShorts","origin_country":""},{"id":225566,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crush,
