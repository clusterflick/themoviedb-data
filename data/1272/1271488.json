The sky is blue, with ... those little puffy clouds like meringues. There are still leaves on the trees. Oh . quite a few birds are gathering . \" All is peaceful. As they talk, a small figure appears walking towards the cottage on the moorland road. Slowly it becomes recognisable as the Armstrong's son David. David's arrival is unexpected. He left home three years ago, and Faith and Jack have heard nothing from him until now. Things at home have changed a lot in those three years. His father has gone blind, and his brother Malcolm is now engaged 'to Heather. David's former girlfriend. The family are curious. Why has David suddenly decided to return home?
