The recording was made by Lo's daughter Sirong, a renowned, award-winning singer-songwriter in Taiwan. When Lo Lang wrote the poem in 1950, he was expressing his deep desire for freedom. At that time, many Taiwanese were suffering from extreme violence and political repression at the hands of the ruling Kuomingtang, which took over Taiwan after losing the Chinese Civil War to the Chinese Communists. This recording, made in 2018, marks a watershed moment for Lo Sirong and her now deceased father, as Taiwan flourishes today as a fully democratic society.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2020-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4639587,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lo Lang","original_name":"Lo Lang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6612995dd768fe012f41479a","department":"Writing","job":"Original Concept"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2038777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ye Mimi","original_name":"Ye Mimi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661297928c0a48017e055cd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2038777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ye Mimi","original_name":"Ye Mimi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661299826f43ec017dc2b9f0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4639588,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"David Chen","original_name":"David Chen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6612999d19690c0163a3eae0","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4639586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gomoteu","original_name":"Gomoteu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66129942c68b690163049b54","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4639585,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lo Sirong","original_name":"Lo Sirong","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6612993767dcc901309b076a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"0+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"白雲之歌 White Clouds","key":"436016752","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-07T08:43:01.000Z","id":"6612974719690c017ca52bc9"}]}}}
