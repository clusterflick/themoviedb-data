Dimitri and Trulla are to be married. All seems well for the newly-weds, but there is a mystery surrounding Trulla's cousin Janni. An element of the play concerns the genetically-inherited disease thalassaemia. One effect of the disease is that survivors continue to have the appearance of 14-year-olds, even in their 20s. Due to the impossibility of simulating this, thalassaemic patients take part in the play.","popularity":1.1803,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5846,"logo_path":"/h9O2O30eqiYaNi8qRKclV2U4Wjw.png","name":"Thames
