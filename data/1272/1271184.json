Accustomed to working mostly in photography, they were asked to make a book with photos and texts. Even so, the community suggested making a movie, \"like these that appear on television.\" A year later, Seoane returned to the community, carrying, in addition to his photographic equipment, six pocket cameras so that the community, and especially the young people, could film and participate creatively in the making of his film. The documentary Chatdÿe Tsimane (Chimán Relative), filmed and edited collectively, is the result of this experience.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oE3R63Yi0lcNa9xQvozOEASsWUr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CHATDŸE TSIMANE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4640175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Seoane","original_name":"Manuel Seoane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6612e72cd7f4650162689f73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oE3R63Yi0lcNa9xQvozOEASsWUr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
