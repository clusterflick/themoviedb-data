As the details of the case slowly emerge the police determine that that the \"nun\" may only be a silent witness to the grisly murders. The task force then turns its attention on the Catholic Church and a suspect group of Priests that have had a propensity for \"cleansing the souls\" of innocent young choir boys.","popularity":1.0826,"poster_path":"/A8K6hWN7jECh0ULu2kSXqwMWuiN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13903,"logo_path":null,"name":"James Vallo Movies","origin_country":""},{"id":9101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Knee Deep Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Oh Mary, it's scary!","title":"Sister Mary","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ant","original_name":"Ant","popularity":0.1908,"profile_path":"/rHfHVB6ppK7TJHxbwZQvCsZRcBP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Agent Peccant","credit_id":"52fe4c9e9251416c751202e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Vallo","original_name":"James Vallo","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mark Rima","credit_id":"52fe4c9e9251416c751202e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Vilanch","original_name":"Bruce Vilanch","popularity":0.35,"profile_path":"/2XMRxwHF5uCTxNf9qkq8IKG12Jj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Farmer Jake","credit_id":"52fe4c9e9251416c751202ed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Feeney","original_name":"Matthew Feeney","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":"/cz3Gh75ZtbG0hOjOMWiAvA1afit.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Chief Homer Bathos","credit_id":"52fe4c9e9251416c751202f5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1058963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Shields","original_name":"Michelle Shields","popularity":0.131,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Detective Emma Sharp","credit_id":"52fe4c9e9251416c751202f9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1166571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Pusztay","original_name":"James Pusztay","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Father O'Bleary","credit_id":"52fe4c9e9251416c751202fd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1166572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Z.D.
