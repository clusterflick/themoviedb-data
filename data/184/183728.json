The title equalizes the species of the earth. Artavazd Peleshian merely alludes to the presence of human beings—a few silhouettes that seem to be the cause of these vast, anxious movements of animal fear. In many ways, this film is an ode to the animal world that moves toward formal abstraction, with clouds of silver birds pulverizing light. Peleshian said, “It’s hard to give a verbal synopsis of these films. Such films exist only on the screen, you have to see them.”","popularity":0.341,"poster_path":"/p0b14j7z7gYEGLtw4OR6b8XZ1i7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19556,"logo_path":null,"name":"Minsk Film Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1970-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inhabitants","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Inhabitants","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AM","title":"Բնիկներ","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Обитатели","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Artavazd Peleshian","original_name":"Artavazd Peleshian","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/w7fcAywIWYrPwAupDmV28b4TSes.jpg","credit_id":"605944c55c071b00757472e0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Artavazd Peleshian","original_name":"Artavazd Peleshian","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/w7fcAywIWYrPwAupDmV28b4TSes.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4caa9251416c751219cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0298373","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":732,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/U6S3cmSiF2O7TPZ4wO7QG1aTHN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1302}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1550,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zRxL4sImJ8fKXxWcG3aE5ZeZ7gb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/p0b14j7z7gYEGLtw4OR6b8XZ1i7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3jEK7GZAZWeOvN8arFg39PixHzO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10787,"name":"jungle"},{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":221178,"name":"stampede"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":310139,"name":"animal panic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
