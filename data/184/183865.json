The film comprises one still and highly sober shot of Cocteau facing the camera head-on to address the youth of the future. Once recorded, this spoken message for the 21st century was sealed and stored with the understanding that it would be opened only in the year 2000. As it turned out, it was discovered and exhumed a few years shy of that date. Where in The Testament of Orpheus  Cocteau portrays himself as a living anachronism, a lonesome classical modernist loitering in space-time while lost in the spectral light of his memories, here he acknowledges explicitly the irony of his phantom-like state. By the time the viewer sees this image, he, J. C., our saviour Poet, will long be dead.","popularity":0.1404,"poster_path":"/eh1xuEqMVEA0E3yIWvllP7aaV7z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1962-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jean Cocteau Addresses the Year 2000","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Jean Cocteau Speaks to the Year 2000","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cocteau","original_name":"Jean Cocteau","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":"/vD73WSmN0hH3ZDjlh6n73CJI5sC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4cae9251416c75122243","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cocteau","original_name":"Jean Cocteau","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":"/vD73WSmN0hH3ZDjlh6n73CJI5sC.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cae9251416c75122249","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cocteau","original_name":"Jean Cocteau","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":"/vD73WSmN0hH3ZDjlh6n73CJI5sC.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cae9251416c7512224f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1537031","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wBjhzInGL2p3uzfDYixta9sf35J.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eh1xuEqMVEA0E3yIWvllP7aaV7z.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/czjylFa7yVVzO7NWP10a6nKnYUA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/cxgsPb6HTQxKC6mgeqgD8HNQZA7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
