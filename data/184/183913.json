She observes the land with surveyor's instruments, watching African bodies, with bleeding wounds, which melt into the landscape. She is recording the evidence of violence and massacre that is part of South Africa's recent history. Felix Teitelbaum, who features in Kentridge's first and fourth films as the humane and loving alter-ego to the ruthless capitalist white South African psyche, appears here semi-naked and alone in a foreign hotel room, brooding over Nandi's drawings of the damaged African landscape, which cover his suitcase and walls. Kentridge has commented: 'Felix in Exile was made at the time just before the first general election in South Africa, and questioned the way in which the people who had died on the journey to this new dispensation would be remembered'.","popularity":0.1629,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1994-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Zulu","iso_639_1":"zu","name":"isiZulu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Felix in Exile","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":23,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1075458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Kentridge","original_name":"William Kentridge","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/e5wLYqybCfMJdCr5vTZ4SDxedpc.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4caf9251416c751224cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":225396,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Angus Gibson","original_name":"Angus Gibson","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5408742c0e0a262685001bd1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1075458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Kentridge","original_name":"William Kentridge","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/e5wLYqybCfMJdCr5vTZ4SDxedpc.jpg","credit_id":"540874180e0a262685001bce","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1153397,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wilbert Schübel","original_name":"Wilbert Schübel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540874fdc3a368582c001093","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109928,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philip Miller","original_name":"Philip Miller","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc6fc4b92514136a9009ba4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1756512","wikidata_id":"Q111699905","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3644,"name":"south africa"},{"id":12990,"name":"singing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
