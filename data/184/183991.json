Bill Wyman: Blues Odyssey follows the rise of the blues in America as it travels from the Mississippi Delta and the Deep South to the big cities of New Orleans and Chicago, and then crosses the ocean to England, where the U.K.'s nascent rock 'n' roll scene helped spark a new interest and appreciation for the music. Bill Wyman: Blues Odyssey features performance footage of such legendary artists as Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Lightnin' Hopkins, The Rolling Stones, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and many more. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi","popularity":0.2311,"poster_path":"/7gNDHRiI1npM4r2xmC4AuFdsXlA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill Wyman's Blues Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Wyman","original_name":"Bill Wyman","popularity":0.2156,"profile_path":"/hFQhBIe36MWEYJTdf3YGTINIPkj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"52fe4cb19251416c75122953","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0299564","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7gNDHRiI1npM4r2xmC4AuFdsXlA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
