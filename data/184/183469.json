A new activity frowned upon by police and adults, skateboarding gave youngsters a thrilling sensation of speed and freedom. This film - the first Canadian documentary ever made about the sport - captures the exuberance of boys and girls having the time of their lives in free-wheeling downhill locomotion.  Jutra's 1966 mockumentary film The Devil's Toy (Rouli-roulant), is a faux-anti-skateboarding propaganda film.","popularity":0.4352,"poster_path":"/i8Uz3UMROm1krO2knxlor3fyU1x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1966-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil's Toy","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Rouli-roulant","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Charpentier","original_name":"Pierre Charpentier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gz0h3rjgjYlk7HYfZz5tyAWBafD.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self (uncredited)","credit_id":"57e3cb79c3a3682cb30025e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Denner","original_name":"Charles Denner","popularity":0.2645,"profile_path":"/fXrk3RHA1c60h3RuYc4CRQLRjCB.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Récitant / Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"57e3cb84925141123c004ed8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Harvey","original_name":"Marc Harvey","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/kdE4RKG2vOh2x8kJqKBfjitdXRB.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57e3cb8dc3a3687597004e7f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Jutra","original_name":"Claude Jutra","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":"/xgxuISfpUQIquTpzt92SzcmlqQd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ca39251416c75120b8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Jutra","original_name":"Claude Jutra","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":"/xgxuISfpUQIquTpzt92SzcmlqQd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ca39251416c75120b95","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1166700,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marcel Martin","original_name":"Marcel Martin","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ca39251416c75120b9b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550175,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michel Brault","original_name":"Michel Brault","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/bDGiQWl2UblKpR9h1qFQ3THUsj1.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ca39251416c75120ba1","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1166701,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sidney Pearson","original_name":"Sidney Pearson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ca39251416c75120ba7","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166702,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Werner Nold","original_name":"Werner Nold","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ca39251416c75120bad","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166703,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Florent Brault","original_name":"Pierre F.
