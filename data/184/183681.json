This visually stunning road movie takes the spectator on a bleak journey from the shores of the Black Sea to the frozen heart of Chernobyl, passing through desolate, snowy landscapes, littered with abandoned villages. Squatting in this icy wasteland, the ghostly sarcophagus of Reactor No.4 is a constant reminder of the threat still lurking below.  Accompanied by testimony from a group of unseen veterans of the disaster, Precarious bears witness to both the folly and resilience of humans and to nature's fragility.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wdEGgqGA3TMbIfsQ6jRxYmDpNYO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Precarious","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2566781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merilyn Fairskye","original_name":"Merilyn Fairskye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6db377a9b9a40012a16e97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1841793","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wdEGgqGA3TMbIfsQ6jRxYmDpNYO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1388}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
