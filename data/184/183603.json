It's another early example of a two-shot film along the lines of Paul's earlier film Come Along Do!. The young man plays a magician who, after completing his act, agrees to go home with the young boy from the audience who helped him perform his tricks. At the boy's home he finds a sick sister and a worried mother being threatened with eviction by her landlord.","popularity":0.2676,"poster_path":"/7phQbP7IdxUG8E5JHMfuOkREhdr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44944,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robert W.
