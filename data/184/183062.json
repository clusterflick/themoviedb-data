But the title of Bobbi Jo Hart's award-winning biographical documentary, I am Not a Rock Star, speaks to the contradictions of Bournaki's life. Shot over a span of eight years - following the pianist from 12 to 20 years of age - Hart's film amounts to a front row seat in the unfolding of a life and the forming of a personality. Shot in verité style in concert halls, hotels and airports around the world and featuring stunning piano performances, the film turns Bournaki's life into a visual narrative, revealing both the rewards and costs of a life dedicated to music","popularity":0.0671,"poster_path":"/7rX3WrPwhKkjN73Glot1tJgkT3l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Not a Rock Star","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marika Bournaki","original_name":"Marika Bournaki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5da88726944a57001325cc52","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1166121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bobbi Jo Hart","original_name":"Bobbi Jo Hart","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/b6IHnXmPUWTmHEHdUxPBDbC5kGV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c959251416c7511efeb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1166121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bobbi Jo Hart","original_name":"Bobbi Jo Hart","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/b6IHnXmPUWTmHEHdUxPBDbC5kGV.jpg","credit_id":"5da886c770309f001466052f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2273275","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1348,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7rX3WrPwhKkjN73Glot1tJgkT3l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":906}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vancouver International Film Festival","release_date":"2012-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Abril 2013 No sóc una estrella de rock / No soy una estrella de rock","key":"DrQJhD0oi2c","published_at":"2013-02-05T12:39:06.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec708c3a368544800a5af"}]}}}
