After robbing Jules Tulane’s estate of his crop, Scarlet takes over Tulane’s land debt and forces him to pay or go to prison. In exchange for postponing his debt, Scarlet allows Tulane’s son, André, to work as her servant. When André and Scarlet fall in love, it leads to jealous rage from Scarlet’s former paramour, expert swordsman Hugo — and when Hugo looks to raid the Tulane estate again, it is up to André and Scarlet to take him down and save the estate.","popularity":1.7578,"poster_path":"/bp1s7Ew0UJMH3myXX5tncclmmUP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3458,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clover Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1955-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Roaring Story of the Notorious Lili Scarlet -- Gambling Queen of the Mississippi!","title":"Duel on the Mississippi","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Duel On The Mississippi","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"En Louisiane, en 1820, des pillards ravagent la plantation des Tulane.
