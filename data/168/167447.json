I Am Nasrine is an intimate journey of self-discovery and ultimately reveals the unfolding of a soul. Set in modern day Tehran, and the UK, the film follows the paths of Nasrine and Ali, sister and brother in a comfortable, middle class Iranian home. When Nasrine has a run-in with the police, the punishment is more than she bargained for. At her father's bidding, Nasrine and Ali set out for the UK, torn about leaving behind their home and all that they know, embarking on a reluctant exile.","popularity":0.2565,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about love, finding oneself and the eternal search for home.","title":"I Am Nasrine","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micsha Sadeghi","original_name":"Micsha Sadeghi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nasrine","credit_id":"52fe4cb1c3a36847f823aa11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shiraz Haq","original_name":"Shiraz Haq","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ali","credit_id":"52fe4cb1c3a36847f823aa15","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Coulson","original_name":"Christian Coulson","popularity":0.5098,"profile_path":"/kFwnSTUCCRFWSvqQAU1cykrLqPK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tommy","credit_id":"52fe4cb1c3a36847f823aa19","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1149066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Hooper","original_name":"Steven Hooper","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Leigh Hall","credit_id":"52fe4cb1c3a36847f823aa07","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182754,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Raedeker","original_name":"David Raedeker","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/iJ2H6wnAQJndLydvbHGDqaZrFDk.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cb1c3a36847f823aa25","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1149198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Gharavi","original_name":"Tina Gharavi","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cb1c3a36847f823aa1f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182755,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Chryssanthy Kofidou","original_name":"Chryssanthy Kofidou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cb1c3a36847f823aa2b","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1149198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Gharavi","original_name":"Tina Gharavi","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cb1c3a36847f823aa0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5304383,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tommy Hair","original_name":"Tommy Hair","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d468dbdcba70a269650356","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1440118","wikidata_id":"Q5976009","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jzCo60Vx38WKXMbVlD88cdYECJo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"I AM NASRINE (official trailer)","key":"HAAIwW8bQzg","published_at":"2011-05-13T14:32:22.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec701c3a368544800a013"}]}}}
