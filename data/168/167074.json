He and his daughter Val conspire to keep the cause of death quiet, but tensions mount when Val becomes attracted to the dead farmer's son, Rai, estranged from his father and now a hairdresser in the city. The tensions open long-festering family resentments and spur the lurid imagination of Val's younger sister, the teen Genia. \"What goes unsaid, gets undone,\" the Pasiegos say, but is it true? Is there harm in staying silent?","popularity":0.5354,"poster_path":"/guy0eawU356RADCj8GUx6Ne20IV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7680,"logo_path":"/aZ5xfV3J3kSShvHxo06ypgE2QBD.png","name":"Tornasol Media","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2004-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Your Next Life","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Diego","original_name":"Juan Diego","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/dzHln6RFlKlRTe2HLAN113zliMQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gildo","credit_id":"52fe4ca9c3a36847f823922b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Tosar","original_name":"Luis Tosar","popularity":0.6536,"profile_path":"/7ZTdhzUCpG9jhsKJeTJbGn36v5F.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rai","credit_id":"52fe4ca9c3a36847f823922f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marta Etura","original_name":"Marta Etura","popularity":0.5162,"profile_path":"/a6aAilLDKbIXGwBfNgGc44RufVB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Val","credit_id":"52fe4ca9c3a36847f8239233","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":224731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Lago","original_name":"Clara Lago","popularity":0.6177,"profile_path":"/9AOxrciWElj0637MUO5U4K4YFuJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Genia","credit_id":"52fe4ca9c3a36847f8239237","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celso Bugallo","original_name":"Celso Bugallo","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/qtwvr4et0jxNGKISJFDL0YmGRTY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Severo","credit_id":"52fe4ca9c3a36847f823923b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":230209,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ángeles González-Sinde","original_name":"Ángeles González-Sinde","popularity":0.1744,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ca9c3a36847f8239247","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47059,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerardo Herrero","original_name":"Gerardo Herrero","popularity":0.2368,"profile_path":"/bAJRt3PSM2oL1UuIsyaDsIsS8Gv.jpg","credit_id":"63b85c74f44f27007d70b004","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":649147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Gutiérrez Aragón","original_name":"Manuel Gutiérrez Aragón","popularity":0.2186,"profile_path":"/xbC9TYqrl8UOVeBbzPrXiK6rPOY.jpg","credit_id":"5cfe2e5a0e0a262d92ca341e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":649147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Gutiérrez Aragón","original_name":"Manuel Gutiérrez Aragón","popularity":0.2186,"profile_path":"/xbC9TYqrl8UOVeBbzPrXiK6rPOY.jpg","credit_id":"5eff24e851c01f0036371cdb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0395296","wikidata_id":"Q3311941","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1002,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/guy0eawU356RADCj8GUx6Ne20IV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5IaM2fHWNZVL5GnUAxKyKkItJwC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":227969,"name":"farmer family"},{"id":267422,"name":"rural setting"},{"id":292859,"name":"widowed father"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"15+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Clara-Lago.es Trailer La vida que te espera","key":"OCy_y--c5mM","published_at":"2010-03-21T06:20:56.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec701c3a3685448009ff1"}]}}}
