Passengers on the Seattle-to-L.A. trip know him as \"Johnny Berlin\" - the man responsible for making their beds and cleaning their toilets. We get to know him differently - as a middle-aged, struggling writer with a workaday job and as many dreams as he has beds to clean. He's a true wanderer, whose plan is to spend his savings on a trip to Cambodia to write his long-gestating novel.","popularity":0.222,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Johnny Berlin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1964399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Hyrns","original_name":"Jon Hyrns","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a63f0e59251410b25019a35","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1453763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominic DeJoseph","original_name":"Dominic DeJoseph","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a63efa69251410b1a019327","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Stipe","original_name":"Michael Stipe","popularity":0.2504,"profile_path":"/ooBrKtelltirieu14MmxW7cLS4X.jpg","credit_id":"5a829081c3a3684d0700c745","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0462371","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
