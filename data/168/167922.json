The piece revolves around a mysterious notebook filled with obsessive listings of places, objects, and incidents. These listings serve as the key to a hidden city: a city of unconsidered geographies and layered artifacts—the relics of low-level capitalism and the debris of countless forgotten narratives. The project stems from the filmmaker's first job in New York—working as a pushcart vendor on Canal Street. As usual, Cohen shot in hundreds of locations using unobtrusive equipment and generally without any crew. Influenced by the work of Walter Benjamin.","popularity":0.1359,"poster_path":"/BQAEZODbLGa5x4piQzOUrDPNVs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Book Found","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jem Cohen","original_name":"Jem Cohen","popularity":0.134,"profile_path":"/3xNsHx8jz7bZrfxGCbDfSIfDcdT.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cbdc3a36847f823ccf9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0230468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uPKVaIha9Bfa36626tpeRe7YzTr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eO6rNX1FCgaiybl3fehjWjqewMp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":10.054,"height":56,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yg245u33mO2zUsaqbe3TQFEEKGZ.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/BQAEZODbLGa5x4piQzOUrDPNVs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1035,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2AlhyI6gRLdBkZkp4ZMmeUHjPvL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":690}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
