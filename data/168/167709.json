In 1971, he recorded an interview with her that went largely unseen until 2003—Eustache never screened the complete film publicly, although a radically truncated version was presented on television. In a string of long, stationary takes, the camera watches over Eustache’s shoulder while he pours countless glasses of whiskey and Odette tells the stories of her life. A number of her themes resonate with those of Eustache’s films: cruelty, male philandering, the Rosière festival of Pessac. Number Zero is a return to origins—of cinema and of the self—and an experiment in narration, both restrained and deeply personal.","popularity":0.0753,"poster_path":"/e5XQ4kBNkESJ2SNh9xB9jrch0MG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Odette Robert","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Eustache","original_name":"Jean Eustache","popularity":0.2372,"profile_path":"/8UM9rFEFwrLRS9Felhk38xDJuSV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ad271d3c3a3683ef9017c68","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2942308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Odette Robert","original_name":"Odette Robert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"640decb82a09bc00f72d2330","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Eustache","original_name":"Jean Eustache","popularity":0.2372,"profile_path":"/8UM9rFEFwrLRS9Felhk38xDJuSV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cb9c3a36847f823c06f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Eustache","original_name":"Jean Eustache","popularity":0.2372,"profile_path":"/8UM9rFEFwrLRS9Felhk38xDJuSV.jpg","credit_id":"5ad27212925141736a0165d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Eustache","original_name":"Jean Eustache","popularity":0.2372,"profile_path":"/8UM9rFEFwrLRS9Felhk38xDJuSV.jpg","credit_id":"5ad272280e0a266c1c0186dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Eustache","original_name":"Jean Eustache","popularity":0.2372,"profile_path":"/8UM9rFEFwrLRS9Felhk38xDJuSV.jpg","credit_id":"5ad27230c3a3683f00018dda","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":"","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2367,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/e5XQ4kBNkESJ2SNh9xB9jrch0MG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1578},{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ukgNHLYt1XUAALFnIbHGL70uqG7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"TF1 - Grand-mères","release_date":"1980-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
