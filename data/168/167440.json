The dismantling of the old Royal Hospital to transform it into a luxury hotel fills the streets of Santiago de Compostela with the sick, perpetual pilgrims and the poor. It happens that the night is black, like the future, like the hearts of men, like the country, and it becomes long, very long. Thus, a night of peaceful wandering turns into a mad race for survival of two strangers, friends in pain, who, unable to change the world, no matter how hard they try, struggle, at least, and with all their strength, to see it again tomorrow.","popularity":0.1332,"poster_path":"/bcRgUCwbo4SlZoVShRv993zJel8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2011-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Galician","iso_639_1":"gl","name":"Galego"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doentes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Durán 'Morris'","original_name":"Antonio 'Morris' Durán","popularity":0.1274,"profile_path":"/3D3wl7paKTwDqzq1dbvf6Y7MKU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cb1c3a36847f823a997","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1111671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xosé Manuel Olveira","original_name":"Xosé Manuel Olveira","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cb1c3a36847f823a99b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Álvaro Guevara","original_name":"Álvaro Guevara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cb1c3a36847f823a99f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1009354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Balza","original_name":"Gustavo Balza","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cb1c3a36847f823a993","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":585853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Vidal Bolaño","original_name":"Roberto Vidal Bolaño","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bc7549ab8fd8a268bea4c6","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3977105,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roberto G.
