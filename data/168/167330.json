Gödicke is called when two bestial murdered children are found in the forest. The investigator tries to get involved in the perpetrators - a rarely used method at the People's Police - and the perpetrator so on the track. The Stasi-Major Witt is no friend of this procedure and leaves the commissioner only reluctantly free hand in the investigation. The matter does not go to the authorities fast enough and is then simply put to the files. When another murder occurs, it becomes clear that Gödicke was much closer to the enlightenment of the act than everyone thought.","popularity":0.3501,"poster_path":"/5iFf5meTmWOMchHmKa63lFGTWbw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mord in Eberswalde","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Fall Hagedorn","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Mord in Eberswalde - Der Fall Hagedorn","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian Panzner","original_name":"Florian Panzner","popularity":0.4292,"profile_path":"/6hltmMrlXbAvcIgtirg1VNqnmzJ.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Stefan Witt","credit_id":"5348e642c3a3684b93000d9a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronald Zehrfeld","original_name":"Ronald Zehrfeld","popularity":0.3574,"profile_path":"/cl76qf5nskBoD1q7WWajH3LdPV0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Heinz Gödicke","credit_id":"52fe4caec3a36847f823a223","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1079462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrike C.
