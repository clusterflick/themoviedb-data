Ilé Aiyé uses experimental film techniques, music, and cultural observation to express the life and rituals of Candomblé and the symbolic manifestation of the Orishás, the deities which represent the wide range of natural and spiritual forces. The rhythms of the sacred drums and bells, a dance of spiritual ecstasy, offerings and sacrifices, divination and the visitation of the Orishás through trance are all part of the color and life of Candomblé.","popularity":0.1769,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Îlé Aiyé","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Îlé Aiyé (The House of Life)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3078,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Byrne","original_name":"David Byrne","popularity":0.5258,"profile_path":"/iyD9S1hvyWjtiAedZAACDcWKuaf.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cbec3a36847f823cfbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0098730","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
