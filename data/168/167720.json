There were four young men of different nationalities: Spanish, Italian, Swedish and British, a one-pound business deal that ends up becoming a one-hundred-thousand pound business deal, and a legend: The Legend of David Pilgrim.

All this takes place right in the centre of \"Chicken Town\"... a city where everything is possible... even a story like this one.","popularity":0.1239,"poster_path":"/ch2nK639grOWCvWsCEECKKRo5Vi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2001-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El factor Pilgrim","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Álex O'Dogherty","original_name":"Álex O'Dogherty","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/asQRtN7bEnf82IGE6GBmo5htXAS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Francisco","credit_id":"52fe4cb9c3a36847f823c0c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1273962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrico Vecchi","original_name":"Enrico Vecchi","popularity":0.0549,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Giuseppe","credit_id":"582c8d2a9251416377000703","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":238256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Nightingall","original_name":"Howard Nightingall","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Julius McDoom","credit_id":"582c8d4c925141637f000745","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jöns Pappila","original_name":"Jöns Pappila","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ambar Pool","credit_id":"582c8d70925141637900078f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":562915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santi Amodeo","original_name":"Santi Amodeo","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cb9c3a36847f823c0c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Rodríguez","original_name":"Alberto Rodríguez","popularity":0.1261,"profile_path":"/8I9Idvbad8P2lP2fuH5IOJAuYMZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cb9c3a36847f823c0bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0263328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1134,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ch2nK639grOWCvWsCEECKKRo5Vi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":756}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"AP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
