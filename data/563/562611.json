We see whimsical references to domesticity (kitchen implements), clothing (shoes), the housing situation (want ads), feminist film (Annette Kuhn's book Women's Pictures), relationships, claustrophobia. The final shots show the dollhouse outside, up in the branches of a tree - by the effort of cinema, the dollhouse has become a tree-house. This thematic movement mirrors the movement of Barbara Hammer's films in the last few years: from preoccupation with inside/the body, to a claiming of outside/the landscape.\" â€”Claudia Gorbman, Jump Cut.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/8pfxjSOb9t9lxBZCT7XBUI3LQ6k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doll House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"5bf0b8e29251415cc8045c35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q123350345","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8pfxjSOb9t9lxBZCT7XBUI3LQ6k.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
