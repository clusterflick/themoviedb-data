Let’s get to it with another edition of #BACKFILL…  Just as a head’s up – day one weighed in at three and a half hours, with day two being over four hours long. Just in case you’re going to block out time to watch either or both of these shows!  The second day started with a cool highlight package set to Rammstein’s “Sonne”, showing clips of each match from the first night – a fine way to sum up day one!","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":186,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PROGRESS Chapter 19: Super Strong Style Tournament 2016 (Night Two)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
