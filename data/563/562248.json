Resigned to the nostalgic impulse, she flies from Europe to Novustoinovsk - a district city in the middle of the country, which has long ceased to exist. There, in the provincial hinterland of the past, her memories and old friends live, all of them ephemeral as television programs from another life. This is a life story about fate of ordinary people, about quarrels, spiritual growth and decline, about hope and changeable memory.","popularity":0.0466,"poster_path":"/lUdHXQvQ965za9NqlmJ4H2jXgu0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life #1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingeborga Dapkūnaitė","original_name":"Ингеборга Дапкунайте","popularity":0.4391,"profile_path":"/epH5vef5Tm6b2VyU71KKCxw9tyd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Марина","credit_id":"5beeb5b99251415cc8014d20","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2020941,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mariya Pasichnik-Raksha","original_name":"Mariya Pasichnik-Raksha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kv7Gy3uvhTCAKvQ6Zj3b4brwF39.jpg","credit_id":"5beeb5340e0a26265e01779d","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2176663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Raksha","original_name":"Vladimir Raksha","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/3o3xGohTq37B7JRJi6mNOOA9my5.jpg","credit_id":"5beeb4d29251415cd701537a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2176664,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Artem Burko","original_name":"Artem Burko","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5beeb37fc3a36818b6018394","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2176666,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yury Troyankin","original_name":"Юрий Троянкин","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5beeb57b0e0a2626610162fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2176663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Raksha","original_name":"Vladimir Raksha","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/3o3xGohTq37B7JRJi6mNOOA9my5.jpg","credit_id":"5beeb3689251415cc401483b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2176667,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexander Mansurov","original_name":"Alexander Mansurov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5beeb599c3a36818b60185fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2176665,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Denis Losanov","original_name":"Denis Losanov","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5beeb568c3a36818b60185b6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1143,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lUdHXQvQ965za9NqlmJ4H2jXgu0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":814}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
