He’s now got Will Ospreay tonight, and Havoc’s taken exception to Will’s comments… so he’s decided to go all Dexter and tie someone to a table with cling film so he can murder them.  The innocent victim’s face is covered with Havoc’s title belt, and Jimmy asks us “if you think I’m doing this for fun, what do you think I’ll do to someone I hate?”. Cue stabbings… and if you’re worried, of course it wasn’t real. Tom Irvin (who was under the belt) survived.  We start with a tag title match, but it’s not a tag match, as FSU faced each other for “sole ownership” of the tag titles. I’m not too sure what made FSU turn on each other, but there you go… before we can get going, the lights go out, and out come the Faceless through the crowd and attack FSU.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":186,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PROGRESS Chapter 17: Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8017124","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
