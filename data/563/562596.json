The museum is appropriately impossible in its scope, as Atherton playfully acknowledges the imaginative space of virtual worlds. The fantasy exhibitors have free rein in their show, “Four Rooms and a Toilet,” even to the point of cutting windows in partitions, exposing the building’s masonry, and breaking down the wall between the sex-segregated toilets. Atherton, as the gallery guide, justifies each of the artists’ disruptive requests in high-art terminology as we “move” through the rooms.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gallery Guide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Atherton","original_name":"Kevin Atherton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf0a59fc3a36818aa0452cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
