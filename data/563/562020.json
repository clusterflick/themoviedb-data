Nothing more. Laurent Pelly’s production presents a deserted landscape in which the turbulent arrival of Doctor Dulcamara causes a sensation. And with good reason! He is said to be the inventor of a mysterious love potion… In opera, love philtres often provoke terrible tragedies. They also provide the pretext for this gentle comedy in which Sergeant Belcore and the timid Nemorino vie with each other for beautiful Adina’s heart. The stage is set! Bring on the music, which, if we are to believe Donizetti, was composed in a fortnight!","popularity":0.1735,"poster_path":"/sqx2vAeEAOX0ZlnOWReTUWQqW8s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Donizetti: L'Elisir d'amore","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1577407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Naforniţă","original_name":"Valentina Naforniţă","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/nijTRF609eHn9KVFtFLo52JoyB9.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Adina","credit_id":"5beef06ac3a36818a501a2c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vittorio Grigolo","original_name":"Vittorio Grigolo","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/wv5ZDtbGF8I0Rnt9ibQWKtO3edG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nemorino","credit_id":"5bed7bd70e0a2632980150ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2148223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Étienne Dupuis","original_name":"Étienne Dupuis","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":"/gb08gk0yEuMdlu5uZKiMbxU0Mmu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Belcore","credit_id":"5bed7be19251413cd5014cc5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriele Viviani","original_name":"Gabriele Viviani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/73KgtXrWUHIhLIjCbpNjX5zUOcs.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Il Dottor Dulcamara","credit_id":"5bed7bf09251413cc901551c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1623829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana González Frontera","original_name":"Adriana González Frontera","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Giannetta","credit_id":"5bed7bfe9251413cea0139c4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148036,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giacomo Sagripanti","original_name":"Giacomo Sagripanti","popularity":0.0591,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5bed7c0a0e0a2632830155da","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Pelly","original_name":"Laurent Pelly","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bed7b6c0e0a2632900154c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377913,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Felice Romani","original_name":"Felice Romani","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/3ADAhIAv7prrxVPzVhPjZdiR65B.jpg","credit_id":"5bed7b600e0a26328601569b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381395,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaetano Donizetti","original_name":"Gaetano Donizetti","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/yBbXkriu2TFY9C8E6Scd6OPV9KU.jpg","credit_id":"5bed7b4c0e0a263286015679","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2176041,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Chantal Thomas","original_name":"Chantal Thomas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bed7b999251413cdb0152a0","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148036,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giacomo Sagripanti","original_name":"Giacomo Sagripanti","popularity":0.0591,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bed7ba99251413cf0013e9e","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/djX5JMCzrYhkuPsUGgzfonGXUrS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":876,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sqx2vAeEAOX0ZlnOWReTUWQqW8s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":584}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"L'Elisir d'amore - Trailer","key":"lFFqh-tCa0A","published_at":"2018-01-29T18:38:49.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5bed7b39c3a36812f3016301"}]}}}
