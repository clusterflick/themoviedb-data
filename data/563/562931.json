Rudolf Nureyev's interpretation of Tchaikovsky's lyrical ballet, far from being a clichéd stereotype of this celebrated masterpiece, is an exposé of astonishingly powerful and recognisable human emotions. Under the inspired and clearcut musical direction of Vello Pähn, this production of one of the jewels of the Paris Opera Ballet's repertoire brilliantly displays the meticulous precision, technical prowess and pure, unmannered style of the company's unrivalled female corps de ballet, eliciting an ethereal, intense beauty captured for DVD in High Definition video and superb surround sound.","popularity":0.1731,"poster_path":"/n8mJEIh6qL6dnt0TSnL15UGFvCg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":146,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tchaikovsky: Swan Lake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnès Letestu","original_name":"Agnès Letestu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5bf2a13f9251415cc40762db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Martinez","original_name":"José Martinez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5bf2a14b0e0a26265e082ba2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Paquette","original_name":"Karl Paquette","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5bf2a1549251415cc107947d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paris Opera Orchestra","original_name":"Paris Opera Orchestra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff36bce67203d0040cb1e20","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Nureyev","original_name":"Rudolf Nureyev","popularity":0.3107,"profile_path":"/5bukL5Fsj1SBCdCtzfpWaUBuftu.jpg","credit_id":"5bf2a1639251415cc1079485","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dpJDJ7xqVh8gUOmW0uBx0YCvoGB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n8mJEIh6qL6dnt0TSnL15UGFvCg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
