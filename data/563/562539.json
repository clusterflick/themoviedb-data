On the initiative of the Mayor, warned by a famous astrologer, the town of La Rochelle is getting ready - 400 years in advance! to celebrate the Fête Nationale with dignity! But the English, who already held almost every square in the Kingdom of France, set their sights on La Rochelle. The enemy fleet cruised off the coast, and while preparations for the festivities continued, orders were given to stretch the enormous chain that was to block access to the port between the two towers. However, this complicated maneuver and responsibility fear to provoke countless avatars.... The fatuity of the captain of the guards, Thimoléon, the reckless coquetry of the governor's daughter, Hiildegarde, the thick stupidity of the adjutant, the deceitfulness of the traitor and the scheming of a mysterious Scotsman lead the city to the brink of the abyss, while the people, excited, stage a fleeting riot in which the daughters of La Rochelle will have the last word.","popularity":0.2316,"poster_path":"/aGMizDvWYZnU8hRhzx2r6bxkWpZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1962-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
