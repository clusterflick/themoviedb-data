Michael, in the middle of an existential crisis, leaves to find shelter in the Brazilian culture. While Enrico tries to explain him his vision of a magnificent country invaded by giant events, Marie, his fiancee, reaches him bringing with her more commitments and responsibilities. While learning to become a narrator, Michael progressively abandons his fear of death, and prepares to resist against the Oppressor, becoming the \"Ultimo Cangaceiro\". Brazil, today like in 1571, is a land to conquer, a prize for a war between two society models: estate and multinational promoters on the one side, housing strength and human rights defenders on the other.","popularity":0.0735,"poster_path":"/pj8Zvm0Ix9wHW7vWoHcw9KBqmXe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lepanto: O Último Cangaceiro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95831,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mike Wells","original_name":"Mike Wells","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5bf2e4bbc3a36838ab016c26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2178769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Billegrav","original_name":"Marie Billegrav","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5bf2e4d20e0a261ac2016059","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2673736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ash Ashaninka","original_name":"Ash Ashaninka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee0ec5d2dda8900227610c5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrico Masi","original_name":"Enrico Masi","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/4X5SnbnojGGmLlXIsBThqRiuhVk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee0ec70c8113d001f797daa","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrico Masi","original_name":"Enrico Masi","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/4X5SnbnojGGmLlXIsBThqRiuhVk.jpg","credit_id":"5bf2e4e7c3a36818a308c54b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrico Masi","original_name":"Enrico Masi","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/4X5SnbnojGGmLlXIsBThqRiuhVk.jpg","credit_id":"5de798e23faba000151473e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pj8Zvm0Ix9wHW7vWoHcw9KBqmXe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1018}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
