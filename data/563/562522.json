Memory of Forgotten War conveys the human costs of military conflict through deeply personal accounts of four Korean American survivors whose experiences and memories embrace the full circle of the war: its outbreak and the day-to-day struggle for survival, separation from family members across the DMZ, the aftermath of a devastated Korean peninsula, and immigration to the United States. Each person reunites with relatives in North Korea conveying beyond words the meaning of four decades of family loss. Their stories belie the notion that war ends for civilians when the guns are silenced and foreshadow the futures of countless others displaced by ongoing military conflict today.","popularity":0.3403,"poster_path":"/jRKx2bKxgGoQjmtebReFv6IJV9C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memory of Forgotten War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ramsay Liem","original_name":"Ramsay Liem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1830c47a1bd60038e71998","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1162616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deann Borshay Liem","original_name":"Deann Borshay Liem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42b26741a5610034ccc7e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2277164","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k6Cri1GammsKoY4Ftl0Zw9Ex3ZT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jRKx2bKxgGoQjmtebReFv6IJV9C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7vlSfBBqXyh95RWCIUyoBncBB8G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1170}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3264,"name":"korean war (1950-53)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
