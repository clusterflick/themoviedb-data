The children used to be sent to boarding school, where they became estranged from their family and culture, but nowadays they can get homeschooling from teachers assigned to them by the Russian authorities. Seven-year-old Zakhar and his older brother Prokopy are the protagonists in this calm, observational film. Zakhar's first year of schooling is with Nelly, a young but serious teacher. She tells him about President Putin and the importance of mathematics, and he learns classical poems by heart.","popularity":0.2458,"poster_path":"/devpqCSQEPfGap2ZUS7hxQJyZ66.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111158,"logo_path":"/9m4vqLnfjoPeyJteUmi2LZQDJ1c.png","name":"Current Time TV","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":86240,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marx Film","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2018-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Big Is the Galaxy?","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"겨울 아이들의 땅","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2177560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ksenia Elyan","original_name":"Ksenia Elyan","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/xEFkfyQy3XaewdqKYHhVsvn1JXy.jpg","credit_id":"5bf068310e0a26265c04183c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2171799,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anton Kuryshev","original_name":"Anton Kuryshev","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/e39fGQ3QyueMw0jSyoydsKmp2ZN.jpg","credit_id":"5bf30fc7c3a36818a5085763","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1668354,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tomáš Doruška","original_name":"Tomáš Doruška","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf30f3fc3a36838ab01a461","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2177560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ksenia Elyan","original_name":"Ksenia Elyan","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/xEFkfyQy3XaewdqKYHhVsvn1JXy.jpg","credit_id":"5bf30e710e0a261ac20197e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Rastorguev","original_name":"Alexandr Rastorguev","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/8D5HUEwMcmvTtw1DIBJRxqV9SRg.jpg","credit_id":"5bf30ef8c3a368189f08d011","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752620,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Max Tuula","original_name":"Max Tuula","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/jBqWou5w3fD1tgtH1kxOzj4Gl0n.jpg","credit_id":"5bf30f099251417c1d0192d0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1752621,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maria Gavrilova","original_name":"Maria Gavrilova","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/flaoosS1ZEEocoMmxXIOSzjQZIF.jpg","credit_id":"5bf30e860e0a261ac2019806","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2177560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ksenia Elyan","original_name":"Ksenia Elyan","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/xEFkfyQy3XaewdqKYHhVsvn1JXy.jpg","credit_id":"5bf30e69c3a36818b60939f9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2070032,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Evgeniya Ostanina","original_name":"Evgeniya Ostanina","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":"/puIXg12c1w3FlvMb3uEzlhkg9Ic.jpg","credit_id":"5bf30f6ac3a368637501b244","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2267671,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lusya Kazaryan","original_name":"Lusya Kazaryan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8f6d8c925141409fa10407","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9233172","wikidata_id":"Q116209965","facebook_id":"howbigisthegalaxy","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3OpzeiLkj3Cz1LvSjEI3Y0MDjTD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/devpqCSQEPfGap2ZUS7hxQJyZ66.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/g1uDNbj5raVcIlhsKLj2SK5G1JG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"International Documentary Filmfestival Amsterdam (IDFA)","release_date":"2018-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"Moscow International Documentary Film Festival DOKer","release_date":"2019-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"How Big is the Galaxy?
