Sexual molestation and abduction are an unfortunate part of our times. And as loving parents, it's up to us to teach our kids to stay safe. It's like teaching them to look both ways before crossing the street... only it's a whole lot trickier. That's where Strong Kids, Safe Kids comes in. This film brings all of the problems - and questions - out in the open. It talks to you and your kids one-on-one. The material is frank and to the point. But presented so entertainingly with music and humor that it's a delight for the whole family to watch together. Again and again.","popularity":1.6686,"poster_path":"/kjPrZ2oOwCx7Y4L0cyNo1yN5CkE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56553,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fair Dinkum
