In a staging reminiscent of a movie set, the mime Baptiste bathes in his memories, tell about his encounter with Garance, his impossible love for a marvelous yet unattainable woman, the magical universe of the stage, life behind the scenes, and the tenuous line performers maintain between reality and illusion. Marc-Oliver Dupin's original score provides the musical backdrop for a choreography alternating between larger ensemble numbers and intimate love duets.","popularity":0.1804,"poster_path":"/pJByOCai7IcSZqIiBQQg4wXaNHF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Enfants du Paradis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3115943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Ciaravola","original_name":"Isabelle Ciaravola","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Garance","credit_id":"60bcbf48f5c8240040581f81","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Ganio","original_name":"Mathieu Ganio","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":"/v7juEj3KbobR7my9n6eT8aU818b.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Baptiste","credit_id":"60bcbf5a5b1240007a70c556","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessio Carbone","original_name":"Alessio Carbone","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Frédérick Lemaître","credit_id":"60bcbf6c0bc5290029e34896","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Pech","original_name":"Benjamin Pech","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pierre François Lacenaire","credit_id":"60bcbf80b0460500571e5761","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnès Letestu","original_name":"Agnès Letestu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bcbfd1d7fbda00295ff36e","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costumer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Roussillon","original_name":"François Roussillon","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bcc028b0460500571e5813","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1984199,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Olivier Dupin","original_name":"Marc Olivier Dupin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bcbfb7b04605007999a446","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25162,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacques Prévert","original_name":"Jacques Prévert","popularity":0.2306,"profile_path":"/fo8jsfHUigLrCnIVAkeGpjD75oz.jpg","credit_id":"60bcc09bb04605007999a545","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3115946,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tsipka Dripka","original_name":"Tsipka Dripka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bcc0f4af95900040e105f2","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Martinez","original_name":"José Martinez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf2b82dc3a36818a507e4b9","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pJByOCai7IcSZqIiBQQg4wXaNHF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
