During the day (and sometimes at night), Namblard ventures deep into the forest, audio equipment in tow, to capture sounds no one’s heard before: a bee rubbing its legs together, the drumbeat of marching ants, the songs of nocturnal animals, ice cracking beneath a frozen lake. A magical and beguiling documentary that asks us to reconsider how we see – and hear – our world, In The Stillness of Sounds offers a wondrous appreciation of nature’s ecosystem.","popularity":0.0548,"poster_path":"/5mNnXgYOXPCBo3EpupZ7PK20naH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An appreciation of natures sounds","title":"In the Stillness of Sounds","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Namblard","original_name":"Marc Namblard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5bf093fec3a36818b003e691","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1901631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Steyer","original_name":"Serge Steyer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf094490e0a26265c047df5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stépane Manchematin","original_name":"Stépane Manchematin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf0942ec3a36818b003e6e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8775280","wikidata_id":"Q107240220","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5mNnXgYOXPCBo3EpupZ7PK20naH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tënk ","release_date":"2021-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"In The Stillness of Sounds - Trailer - 10.
