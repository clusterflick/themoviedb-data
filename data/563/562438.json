One lonely evening, when she has taken a sleeping pill before going to sleep, she doesn't realize that an indiscreet but courteous visitor has entered her house, soon overcome by the rest of the sleeping pill in a glass of water. The husband returns unexpectedly to find his wife lying next to the stranger: \"Monsieur Masure\" has great difficulty in demonstrating to the husband his innocence in this affair. But he succeeds. But Jacqueline is pretty and very tempting, so the Machiavellian Monsieur Masure concocts a whole affabulation to confuse Jacqueline and her lover - by telephone - and then make the latter believe that this famous artificial sleep was not such as to have prevented her from receiving the tributes that he, Masure, was delighted to lavish on her.","popularity":0.1295,"poster_path":"/p2iv4oZORKeX4b2S7m4OIDswJ05.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1961-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Réveille-toi, chérie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Périer","original_name":"François Périer","popularity":0.2882,"profile_path":"/aTgZII5M2ZW936lQJIUh94wQTFV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"5c5400d70e0a26494dddc7f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Gélin","original_name":"Daniel Gélin","popularity":0.293,"profile_path":"/i5zZUU4IhqmJ8EZtbBy2hDRrAyl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Masure","credit_id":"5c5400dec3a36847779b7bf3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geneviève Cluny","original_name":"Geneviève Cluny","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":"/ehT2qVlmQpkj985wy7Y9kH4vb6s.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jaqueleine","credit_id":"5c5400e70e0a2612ccd38492","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28191,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claude Magnier","original_name":"Claude Magnier","popularity":0.1312,"profile_path":"/z05uLcTLO94Sc6ufpY2dvoOBDLY.jpg","credit_id":"6604caa1f90b19017ca7d20e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28191,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claude Magnier","original_name":"Claude Magnier","popularity":0.1312,"profile_path":"/z05uLcTLO94Sc6ufpY2dvoOBDLY.jpg","credit_id":"5bef99d09251415cd90263ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3509304","wikidata_id":"Q19608928","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":951,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p2iv4oZORKeX4b2S7m4OIDswJ05.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":712}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
