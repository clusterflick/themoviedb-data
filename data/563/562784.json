The downside is that this adds many minutes to the show, but it also helps keep the live event feel on tape.  We get our first taste of a Jim Smallman pre-show spiel – and to show his feelings (at the time), he’s bedecked in a Die Havoc Die t-shirt. Jim leads a “Happy Birthday” chant for the company, which gives way to “we want cake” chants, before the crowd show their respects for the (then) recently-passed Perro Aguayo Jr., Cincinnati Red and Drew McDonald.  Jim then teases the crowd with “something after the interval” – but chants of a raffle are quickly shot down. Those never go well in PROGRESS… nor do falafel raffles, but they do make for an exceedingly good chant.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":186,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PROGRESS Chapter 18: The Show We Can't Call Progresslemania For Legal Reasons","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
