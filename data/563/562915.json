For 30 years, Toos Beentjes has desperately tried to uncover the truth behind the mysterious disappearance of her homosexual brother. In vain. The police saw no reason to investigate the case: 'Eventually, heâ€™ll wash up. And if not, the tourists will find him.' The film is not a quest for Piet Beentjes, but tells the story of what happened before and after the disappearance. About the Kafkaesque world Toos entered after her brother disappeared. A world of routine, lackadaisical interest and a lame police investigation.","popularity":0.3469,"poster_path":"/bwSPB1kORrMbxEEFc6Zdz7W8jBj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49794,"logo_path":"/bFqE3eQjWlVjValkuzoBHIY3uV2.png","name":"Zeppers","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":99613,"logo_path":"/u9a9AizRCLzcDMKqJnAy0uYtCJT.png","name":"KRO-NCRV","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Piet is Gone","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2178496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piet Beentjes","original_name":"Piet Beentjes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bf28e7fc3a36818b6088a2f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2178497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toos Beentjes","original_name":"Toos Beentjes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5bf28e8b0e0a26265e0814e6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1312015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaap van Hoewijk","original_name":"Jaap van Hoewijk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zvlJevqZKtp9p26eSEXU0gDz6fY.jpg","credit_id":"5bf290660e0a261ac200fefc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank van den Engel","original_name":"Frank van den Engel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676cd5bd355bec07b0927616","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":223867,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Judith Vreriks","original_name":"Judith Vreriks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/r5ocjHzp4aBaAHDstW04etCyCDc.jpg","credit_id":"676cd5d1d6d10ecc8c128687","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1785888,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean Counet","original_name":"Jean Counet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676cd5e1d6d10ecc8c1286a2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1980310,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris van Oers","original_name":"Chris van Oers","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676cd5efd0b08f971861393f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":587608,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hugo Dijkstal","original_name":"Hugo Dijkstal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676cd5ffd6d10ecc8c1286b3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204536,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benny Jansen","original_name":"Benny Jansen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676cd612d6d10ecc8c1286ba","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8210842","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bwSPB1kORrMbxEEFc6Zdz7W8jBj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1132}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1199,"name":"netherlands"},{"id":172225,"name":"unsolved mystery"},{"id":192008,"name":"kafka"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nederlands Film Festival","release_date":"2018-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"IDFA 2017 | Trailer | Piet Is Gone","key":"DAiEvjzpTp4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-10-31T15:59:48.000Z","id":"676cd707aa8f3159d6128412"}]}}}
