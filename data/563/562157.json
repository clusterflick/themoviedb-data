U.S. President, Jimmy Carter called it \"an island of stability\" in a visit. Yet, only two years later, in the winter of 1979, a revolution occurred. The Shah of Iran was overthrown and the Islamic Republic was established. It was a major change, a complete switch of power. THE YELLOW CURTAIN interweaves the stories of three men around this sensitive time in history--persecuted Persian author, Gholamhossein Saedi, one of his fictional characters, Mansour, and the filmmaker's own grandfather, who worked directly under the Shah. Through a poetic blending of literature and cinema, the film examines many lives turned upside down; and in one rare case, a life turned right side up.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/pvz6Zhstw0d9lHtOq5gFF2rKu2x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Yellow Curtain","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1706627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Azadeh Navai","original_name":"Azadeh Navai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/shHGUdZMCLHGow8567LGQLhNXMN.jpg","credit_id":"5bee40780e0a26266b00e672","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":2984,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pvz6Zhstw0d9lHtOq5gFF2rKu2x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
