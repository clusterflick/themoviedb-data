Her neighbor, a tramp, transforms himself into a \"handsome young man with a big car\", who offers her consolation in the form of an escapist trip through Paris by night. This journey into the Paris of \"champagne and love\" is a rapid overview of all the most famous and undressed night-time spectacles. Sound and color are as mediocre as the selection of acts presented. The hobgoblin magician then takes the young girl to the land of country dreams. It's here that the ridiculous adds to the bad taste. From unclothed, ungainly naiads, we move on to a hunt in which the game is a shivering, unenviable nymph. In the end, the young girl returns to the reality of the flower quay and her repentant fiancé.","popularity":0.2114,"poster_path":"/3mCADA38aDK57aaCsMN6QoxR8Rq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris champagne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2786488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Candido","original_name":"Maria Candido","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":"/cngfSuTuxkAsydX48jSaK68jumw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66090481a894d6017c668a3d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4625439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathalie Cha","original_name":"Nathalie Cha","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6609048bf9183a0166488537","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Gasté","original_name":"Philippe Gasté","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":"/vIiniZolhTsud4Ul3l0CMGfxspG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66090491d5191f017e31c99d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Poupee La Rose","original_name":"Poupee La Rose","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6609049ee6271901630d616d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Lefebvre","original_name":"Jean Lefebvre","popularity":0.5509,"profile_path":"/4YCnvkYHj1lEk2JZxhKOUoOuJRB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"660904a9021cee017c4baaa6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4625440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Lemoing","original_name":"Marjorie Lemoing","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"660904b3283ed9017c1b27da","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4625441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Biquet Marina","original_name":"Biquet Marina","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"660904ba8a0e9b017c503f8e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Pierson","original_name":"Raymond Pierson","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":"/57HprFcc5uh3nWWQ0NoYQa3hl2w.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"660904c52faf4d017dcaf8c2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2876880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lolo Pigalle","original_name":"Lolo Pigalle","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"660904cba6ddcb0163466798","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2176533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Armand","original_name":"Pierre Armand","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66090473a894d6017c668a21","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2176533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Armand","original_name":"Pierre Armand","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf0d0299251415cc1049cb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0997085","wikidata_id":"Q17494021","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3mCADA38aDK57aaCsMN6QoxR8Rq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
