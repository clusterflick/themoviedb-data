In 1863, the painting caused a scandal: the prostitute awaits her client, her expression proud, her demeanour assured. Is this Violetta? Like Olympia, Verdi’s most celebrated heroine surrenders to the spectator just as she surrenders to love, going so far as to die on stage, a woman’s ultimate sacrifice for her lover. Or might it be the spectator who strips her bare and intrudes upon her privacy, in the image of this milieu of social voyeurism? Whatever the case, these two women regard us with defiance and subjugate those who cannot help but look at them.","popularity":0.5932,"poster_path":"/wClWCdkKmtQdomenKIt5gKNd5jA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opéra National de Paris: Verdi's La Traviata","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La Traviata","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ermonela Jaho","original_name":"Ermonela Jaho","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/5cXV7EMRi2AUwMNM4KiBuwDib7m.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Violetta Valéry","credit_id":"5bed8267c3a36812e801672d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1390118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Castronovo","original_name":"Charles Castronovo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/kH3RqNqHPkwywWxysQLxw2Y3Vsb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Alfredo Germont","credit_id":"5bed8278c3a36812f0014aaf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1267405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludovic Tézier","original_name":"Ludovic Tézier","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/u9OD8isxAGK1oLJBs2HSHFCYo07.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Giorgio Germont","credit_id":"5bed82889251413ccc014927","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1755515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Rougier","original_name":"François Rougier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Gastone","credit_id":"5bed829cc3a36812f3016dc6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cornelia Oncioiu","original_name":"Cornelia Oncioiu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Annina","credit_id":"5bed82c40e0a263295016ede","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benoît Jacquot","original_name":"Benoît Jacquot","popularity":0.403,"profile_path":"/n1qaZFqxYxm4nPzfpSYH93QH0eo.jpg","credit_id":"5bed823d9251413cf001499a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148077,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandre Dumas fils","original_name":"Alexandre Dumas fils","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/ipR2EbPl6cuPmCONW8MA8zsTbhC.jpg","credit_id":"5bed8223c3a36812f3016d32","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Maria Piave","original_name":"Francesco Maria Piave","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bed82150e0a263281015753","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948825,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karel Mark Chichon","original_name":"Karel Mark Chichon","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bed8230c3a36812f60166de","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"5bed82089251413cd5015529","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1647260,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Sylvain Chauvelot","original_name":"Sylvain Chauvelot","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bed824a0e0a263281015783","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/is44XKcZ8QalxLlcgbhjkOZ8t7w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":876,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wClWCdkKmtQdomenKIt5gKNd5jA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":266423,"name":"paris national opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"La Traviata - Trailer","key":"btBwq0ErJI0","published_at":"2018-01-29T18:38:50.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5bed81df0e0a26329c0164c5"}]}}}
