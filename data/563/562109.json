They are filmed while waiting to take their turn, while conversing with others, and thinking about their performances. Although they take their duties very seriously and long to be stars, for the filmmakers, they’re just people that can be coordinated as necessary, nothing more. This film, on the contrary, gives them full consideration, revealing their personalities, what they experience, and what they dream of. The footage comes from many different places where movies are made, involving extras from all different nationalities.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/qeeVx0IXSAuECbtn4NJImtvsCyM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74735,"logo_path":null,"name":"CBA","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":20482,"logo_path":"/ncZtCy1XzmVeN674GNBDdvMc8b0.png","name":"Iota
