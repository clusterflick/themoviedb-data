Its universe is full of monsters, gods and natural disasters with a colossal sweep that takes audiences from the stifling atmosphere of the Sicilian court to the unbuttoned joy of a Bohemian festival. Staged at the beautiful and iconic Globe Theatre in London, this new production is directed by Blanche McIntyre and stars Will Keen (The Crown, Wolf Hall) as Leontes, Priyanga Burford (W1A, Marcella) as Hermione and Annette Badland (East Enders, Father Brown) as Old Shepherd.","popularity":1.7443,"poster_path":"/acuLj7uvZzAU6ISA5gvBIOXIqW4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shakespeare's
