What makes the opera notable within this familiar genre is its emphasis on genuine human emotion. Donizetti’s score is graceful and effervescent, as one would expect from this master of melody, but adds an additional level of sophistication to match the comic (yet insightful) proceedings. Recorded on February 28th 2015, at the Opéra de Vichy.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/3Avk8fANhU840xa2OA56FZQcu75.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111322,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra de
