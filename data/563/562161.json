Jourdain is a cloth merchant who wants to become a gentleman, learning dance, music, fencing and philosophy. Mme Jourdain is worried about Dorante's expenses and prefers her daughter Lucile to marry Cléonte. The two young men's servants use subterfuge to get M. Jourdain to accept Cléonte as son-in-law. They fake the arrival of the Grand Turk's son in Paris, and, in an Oriental ballet, confer upon M. Jourdain the title of Mammamouchi, his daughter marrying the son of the Grand Turk, who is none other than Cléonte in disguise.","popularity":0.4617,"poster_path":"/gNFNYQklP7tFcpcFUdgMCAFGMcE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88323,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Cinématographiques","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":534,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmsonor","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":88501,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Comédie-Française","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1958-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Would-Be Gentleman","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Meyer","original_name":"Jean Meyer","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":"/jjQQlUg3bcH8JT9ovGaNUsSwcAL.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Covielle, Cléonte's valet","credit_id":"5f919bfaca83540036b50dc8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Seigner","original_name":"Louis Seigner","popularity":0.3579,"profile_path":"/oP5LPh8jiTfduUtDScypi3O4mol.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Monsieur Jourdain, bourgeois","credit_id":"5f919c4876142100388ba0ea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Manuel","original_name":"Robert Manuel","popularity":0.3461,"profile_path":"/hF7TOkV15X8cOs5mjVgp9fTgpdA.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"the music master","credit_id":"5f919c8e383df20034b36505","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Chamarat","original_name":"Georges Chamarat","popularity":0.1978,"profile_path":"/gDPYzNWcTSxWWEknB5aDtKr0kBL.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"the master of philosophy","credit_id":"5f919cb3ca83540036b51035","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Piat","original_name":"Jean Piat","popularity":0.2281,"profile_path":"/RV8kWi0TOSli2M9ibwIqz5dDpI.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Cléonte, in love with Lucile","credit_id":"5f919cf04581990036aa57be","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Descrières","original_name":"Georges Descrières","popularity":0.3343,"profile_path":"/tQhBUYSvvsVttoEmJ3urweFATlz.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Dorante, count, lover of Dorimene","credit_id":"5f919d3dca83540035b717d9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1650701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Eyser","original_name":"Jacques Eyser","popularity":0.1097,"profile_path":"/lsH8gKAISaK5cayf95p06stzQlQ.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"the fencing master","credit_id":"5f919d14c8f85800396d34a1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Charon","original_name":"Jacques Charon","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/5xWI8TWqGgwDSRMVWYL4QsRrwmb.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"the dancing master","credit_id":"5f919c6ee74146003a9cb08a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2607147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrée de Chauveron","original_name":"Andrée de Chauveron","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/MApDQmHcwfJoDYTxAgfg2Sxthl.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Madame Jourdain","credit_id":"5f919dcdd9f4a60036de99b7","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micheline Boudet","original_name":"Micheline Boudet","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/jM7QKw6m4spbWG3vjTRBrgBbmWc.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Nicole, servant","credit_id":"5f919dfc76142100388ba4fa","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Sabouret","original_name":"Marie Sabouret","popularity":0.0697,"profile_path":"/64khGJXeoFnygwyw4HzIrSFNF26.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Dorimène, marquise","credit_id":"5f919e114581990035a91891","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Grellier","original_name":"Michèle Grellier","popularity":0.1323,"profile_path":"/2N7Eham6L6vcXWluIar0drm6PPc.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Lucile, daughter of M.
