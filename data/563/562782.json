With this year’s SSS16 tournament coming up next week, it’s time to go back and do a #BACKFILL for last year’s two-day tournament…  This was the spiritual follow-up to 2014’s World Cup show, which worked well because the football World Cup took place at around that time as well. Entrants into the inaugural tournament included the likes of Will Ospreay, Mark Haskins, Marty Scurll and Zack Sabre Jr, with fly-ins limited to Tommaso Ciampa and Roderick Strong.  The show opened with a montage of fans saying who they thought would win, before the pre-show amble featured the return of Kris Travis to say a few words to the Camden faithful.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":186,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PROGRESS Chapter 19: Super Strong Style Tournament 2016 (Night One)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
