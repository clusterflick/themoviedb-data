But he is caught up in a very intense love as well as professional life; that's when he choses to film everything as time progresses. Dinner, parties, rehearsals, friendly and family meetings, falsely profound conversations, trips to Europe, etc. THE EXILED is the magnificently happy montage of these sequences, home movie of an obvious and chronic happiness, where the insolence of youth and its beauty are displayed. There are many well-known faces of actors who have become famous since then, which adds to the charm continuously lavished by these innocent images. Self-portrait in the form of a generational portrait, where the love of art crosses the art of living, the exile here is in the land of happiness.","popularity":0.2614,"poster_path":"/u9vt59sZhwj8vxhhCF1gkBvbmYu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49104,"logo_path":"/ltAXIxwQQcAY5uc864bxPN14oph.png","name":"Studio Orlando","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":116637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film(s)","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Exiled","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Ein Exilant auf Glückssuche","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642970,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marcelo Novais Teles","original_name":"Marcelo Novais Teles","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a5e84699251412ea900068f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Amalric","original_name":"Mathieu Amalric","popularity":0.7277,"profile_path":"/fMhfoTbjlXQy2Iojp7oYx49hLQl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a5e84789251412e990006ef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivier Broche","original_name":"Olivier Broche","popularity":0.2395,"profile_path":"/92g3EdByuinF44Rc1fspIo7cUQc.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a5e8487c3a3680160000611","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1058837,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Isabelle Ungaro","original_name":"Isabelle Ungaro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a5e84919251412ea30006fc","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642970,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marcelo Novais Teles","original_name":"Marcelo Novais Teles","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5e84089251412ea6000628","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642970,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marcelo Novais Teles","original_name":"Marcelo Novais Teles","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5e84110e0a26202100068f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642970,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marcelo Novais Teles","original_name":"Marcelo Novais Teles","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5e8420c3a36801430006e2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274262,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Caroline Detournay","original_name":"Caroline Detournay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5e84340e0a2620210006b7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1958838,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Georges de Genevraye","original_name":"Georges de Genevraye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5e8443c3a368014b000776","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450077,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Yves Guéril","original_name":"Jean-Yves Guéril","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5e84500e0a26200e0006eb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7290704","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gxqxufVpBwISb5CyoRN8oKRA2lW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":858,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rWQmsoA6TrrmFCp23SggI9rZKoP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1525}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ipYzgFi2OlThHCVn3L5cDTgdq9b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/u9vt59sZhwj8vxhhCF1gkBvbmYu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FID Marseille","release_date":"2017-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
