You'll follow their story from murderous sorcery and deceit, to a life-changing understanding of what God has done for them. This is a powerful story of God's Word, presented clearly and chronologically in their own language, breaking through the darkness that held the Mouks in bondage. The Next Chapter (33 minutes) NTM missionary, Mark Zook, didn't go all the way from Pennsylvania to Papua New Guinea to share the Gospel in one village. He went to plant a church, and to help that church take God's Word to other Mouk villages and surrounding tribes. You'll witness what happens when people awakened to God's love for the first time in their history take advantage of the opportunity to share His love with others.","popularity":0.2423,"poster_path":"/zR801EqsFhQsXIr7ALjicpkHp4O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EE-Taow!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zR801EqsFhQsXIr7ALjicpkHp4O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":440,"name":"missionary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
