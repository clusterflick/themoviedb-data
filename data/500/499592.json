One of the notable features of Man Vs. Wild is the extreme and often outrageous extents to which Bear will go to as he demonstrates ways to find food or quench his thirst, to survive the extreme and to escape the wild. For the first time ever, Man Vs Wild: Extreme Moments presents a compilation of over 50 of these moments - from Bear jumping off cliffs to eating squishy things, diving naked into icy water, rehydrating himself using unthinkable techniques and many more!","popularity":0.3915,"poster_path":"/9dgl6OkCh9nvBaSFVEDyqA61nq2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85438,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diverse Bristol Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man vs Wild - Extreme Moments Collection","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":208629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bear Grylls","original_name":"Bear Grylls","popularity":0.533,"profile_path":"/vAjjR7b5lnip01W0OIjvaPynNON.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a63f4f7c3a3687f8a017fbf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4344467,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rob Maciver","original_name":"Rob Maciver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653d0c20cc968300ade69a11","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1836125,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Rankin","original_name":"Steve Rankin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653d0c60bc2cb3012c31255c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4149739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Lee","original_name":"Tony Lee","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653d0ca0bc2cb3014d4a8544","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4149739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Lee","original_name":"Tony Lee","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653d0c91519bbb00c433d929","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3905480,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jane Lomas","original_name":"Jane Lomas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653d0c39109cd000c947ce79","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9dgl6OkCh9nvBaSFVEDyqA61nq2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b71Dlxl4opn0ilDUa9nLYWfp4mj.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9KAtvrBSnUzpqLauVhAU1StdY8r.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/opfIGcAYa05eFiAUgtcdNmDGWoA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
