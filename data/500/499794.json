Gracia follows Los Fiambres vocalist Rober Perdut more than thirty years later. He meets a photographer for a photo session in a bus station, is looking for drugs and loses someone named Roni (Rober’s surname does not coincidentally mean ‘disappeared, lost’). Rober sniffs coke from a Johnny Cash CD and is sailed to an island. In other scenes, we follow the photographer, who sometimes disappears mysteriously.","popularity":0.087,"poster_path":"/3DiPH9kz09D2kVACyAoUzXNchJ7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54807,"logo_path":"/wPlbPNfmSepRTBluu2geueypJsV.png","name":"El Viaje Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":13853,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeitun Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":129887,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Horlá producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2018-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wandering Star","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Gracia","original_name":"Alberto Gracia","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60878e6b8ed03f003f6efedb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":971986,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mauro Herce","original_name":"Mauro Herce","popularity":0.1192,"profile_path":"/jgo7dPRkXLvfTpshMddm7WUHLgY.jpg","credit_id":"60878e830c2710006e1eb244","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Gracia","original_name":"Alberto Gracia","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60878e72435abd006d5615b5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402887,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonay Armas","original_name":"Jonay Armas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60878eb0904f6d00587e9fdc","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Gracia","original_name":"Alberto Gracia","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60878e7a84448e004125ae7d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Gracia","original_name":"Alberto Gracia","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60878eb8f9475b0029df92b5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Gracia","original_name":"Alberto Gracia","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6329b10e0a2619fb00bc90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8123608","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":1582,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3DiPH9kz09D2kVACyAoUzXNchJ7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1134}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
