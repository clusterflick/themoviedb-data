He faces the eternal challenge of all actors - how can you bring joy to other people when you yourself have none? Played by Toby Jones, one of Britainâ€™s best character actors (he played and voiced Dobby in Harry Potter films, starred in Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, as wells as on television drama Sherlock), this sad character becomes a hero of a story that resembles an ancient tragedy about being not needed at the feast of life of other people.","popularity":1.0995,"poster_path":"/1IKlpfdF1Vl9OCX7TE4Oerk8odh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Entertainer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toby Jones","original_name":"Toby Jones","popularity":2.0654,"profile_path":"/eOZe7EZ0Ojq8PaIn1HLVex5dZwc.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Paul Limp","credit_id":"643b31578ec4ab0446ae8413","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1013048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theo Barklem-Biggs","original_name":"Theo Barklem-Biggs","popularity":0.4137,"profile_path":"/r1xIDN0ca9NRngD7m560yuZg2Sp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"5d09cfbd9251411dbaba732b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trevor C.
