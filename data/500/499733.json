The title references a 1923 novel by Aleister Crowley, and Genesis originally stated of the film, 'Moonchild is a spell, to create a new person or a new stage in people, through compassion and through thought, and it's a construct, just like a spell is.'\"  “Moonchild is a spell, to create a new person or a new stage in people, through compassion and through thought”  The film stars Genesis’s wife at the time, Paula P-Orridge, and is dedicated to their first-born child, Caresse. It also features John Gosling of Zos Kia and Psychic TV.  \"Moonchild was originally broadcast in 1984 on Spanish television show La Edad De Oro, alongside interviews with Genesis P-Orridge, filmmaker Derek Jarman, and musician and conceptual artist Jordi Valls, and performances by Psychic TV and Vagina Dentata Organ, which caused a forced shutdown of the network by the government at gunpoint.","popularity":0.0533,"poster_path":"/9nETjHSdOBuRwOpB1iu9reAL3Zw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moonchild","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":550261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Genesis P-Orridge","original_name":"Genesis P-Orridge","popularity":0.1393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6273660e0a261a010000ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9nETjHSdOBuRwOpB1iu9reAL3Zw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":988}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
