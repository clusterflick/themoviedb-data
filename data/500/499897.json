Ominous cranes overlook Natasha's land at the edge of Kiev, which year after year is being pushed deeper into a pit by new panel buildings. The brave owner protects not only acres of land, but also traditional family values, faith and ownership. From a bird's-eye view of the farm, a sharp contrast emerges between the village and the city. This peculiar family business model is set forth in a four-year chronicle from the point of view of foreign visitors who don't interfere with the way of life that the family has lived for generations.","popularity":0.1436,"poster_path":"/n2kDjezuGkxEn1dolpf3qYgNi05.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":20810,"logo_path":"/tpwYTOJvC650HgWoYBuYSBVDnON.png","name":"Nutprodukce","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2014-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Hole","type":"festival title"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Яма","type":"festival title"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"My Farm Is My Castle","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892079,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pavla Janoušková Kubečková","original_name":"Pavla Janoušková Kubečková","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a63bbcdc3a3687f8a01468a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1964264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jiří Stejskal","original_name":"Jiří Stejskal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a63bbae0e0a261a0101695b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188188,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tomáš Hrubý","original_name":"Tomáš Hrubý","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a63bbe90e0a261a010169a4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2324593,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Hála","original_name":"Jan Hála","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d67b53aaaf8970010faa623","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1964264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jiří Stejskal","original_name":"Jiří Stejskal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d67b5116743fa0013d65fec","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1964264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jiří Stejskal","original_name":"Jiří Stejskal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d67b523a9b9a40010f4cf46","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2321303,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tomáš Háček","original_name":"Tomáš Háček","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d67b548aaf897000ffa9ead","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1438514,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jakub Hejna","original_name":"Jakub Hejna","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nEH4QNX6DGGfpUiZ4n4VTEEnxOA.jpg","credit_id":"5d67b5316743fa0012d65e4d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4152026","wikidata_id":"Q104897182","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fxIz73sM1bhgDOD3HnYSrDRBYnb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/n2kDjezuGkxEn1dolpf3qYgNi05.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1336,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/bIABPcpG89XdJnTPqhKV4GeeJf6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":891}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18035,"name":"family"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2014-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MY HOME / Jiří Stejskal - goEast 2015 - Trailer","key":"DcrKb4re1c0","published_at":"2015-03-25T16:54:30.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5a63bc19c3a3687fa301470c"}]}}}
