They hear rumors that a Russian ship with a festival talent scout will be arriving in the port of Constanta. The band sets up for a performance at the harbor, in hopes of attracting the scout’s attention immediately upon arrival. A case of mistaken identity leads to a series of complications involving a suitcase, two small-time gangsters, a blonde tourist, and the band’s drummer. This attempt at a plot conforms of course to the conventions of romantic musical comedies, resulting in a film full of song and dance.  With memorable song titles like “Yes, I am an umbrella” and “Let’s play my guitar”, this Romanian-Soviet co-production is as silly as it is irresistible.","popularity":0.1534,"poster_path":"/lqjMmvP7HJEBVD8R5GWswJmi7xk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1971-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Songs of the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","title":"Cîntecele marii","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalya Fateeva","original_name":"Наталья Фатеева","popularity":0.2036,"profile_path":"/jK555rJrB1C5PJxQtA4HYPBBdK3.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"5a5e7bb4c3a3680140000021","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Spataru","original_name":"Dan Spataru","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Michai","credit_id":"5a5e7bc6c3a368014000002e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1161949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ion Dichiseanu","original_name":"Ion Dichiseanu","popularity":0.1708,"profile_path":"/nju92bPrWb65biWa4PB93jULYCX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ganea","credit_id":"5a5e7bdf9251412e9d000067","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Kutcenko","original_name":"Valentina Kutcenko","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b4e4c899251417d18058bda","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisc Munteanu","original_name":"Francisc Munteanu","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/l1tUz1wVRKckGagxxXzlXRFwF0J.jpg","credit_id":"5a5e7c08c3a368014b00006c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0128126","wikidata_id":"Q2898626","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hQ9Rk30PmdAMLXs7ouoowbdnMQz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":524},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/lqjMmvP7HJEBVD8R5GWswJmi7xk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
