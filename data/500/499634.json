This early 1980’s documentary features Garner talking about his life and influences, and comes loaded with narrated excerpts from his books and eerie musical interludes and recorded screams that are curiously reminiscent of The League Of Gentlemen. Other scenes of Garner wandering around his key sites of inspiration – mainly around Alderley Edge in Cheshire – look like they’re from the early days of pop videos, with shaky hand-held footage and sudden zooms into blacked-out windows and strange rock formations. Somehow it all adds to the sincere intention of introducing Garner’s unusual body of work to the unsuspecting viewer.","popularity":0.1552,"poster_path":"/52dnXGKS6sJJuSl3eH5cC2heDrH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14063,"logo_path":"/b7od4dXpqSHIYQx5ykwjnzfKiNv.png","name":"Granada Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Edge of the Ceiling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318572,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alan Garner","original_name":"Alan Garner","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5bef245ec3a36818a30220f4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1773531,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bill Connor","original_name":"Bill Connor","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635189875f4b73008d55f232","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3667446,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Hawes","original_name":"Steve Hawes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6351895e5f4b73008d55f21c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stuart Orme","original_name":"Stuart Orme","popularity":0.2296,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63518973076ce8007a51d55d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4329036","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pIrfdV0g3T3lUHsHmfgIAd1AHsi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.608,"height":1634,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lDMXVrxhQDOaYL2G3AcH67UBHJh.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":994},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rmjwydK9E3N3VYqTePuExnBmxGI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":2601,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/52dnXGKS6sJJuSl3eH5cC2heDrH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1729}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Edge of The Ceiling - Alan Garner","key":"6D6_kO_4WqM","published_at":"2016-02-17T15:52:39.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"5bef24380e0a26266102012e"}]}}}
