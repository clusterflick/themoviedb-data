Albanian artist Adrian Paci constructed Interregnum using footage from official state and national television broadcast archives. Spanning an entire century, the film connects different Communist societies through the shared language of grief. Shifting from close-ups to wider views of the masses, the film makes us witness to a crescendo where the manipulation of these masses and the depersonalisation of individual identity become increasingly evident.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2nS3128rpGEYvYqNnvblAyb64cA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","name":"Albania"}],"release_date":"2017-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interregnum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Paci","original_name":"Adrian Paci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a61e0960e0a2610370152b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1295,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2nS3128rpGEYvYqNnvblAyb64cA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":863}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2018-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
