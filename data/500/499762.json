Images of frames and framed materials recur. Pages of a dictionary flip by, and it is here that the viewer can see a reference to Will Hindle. Entry words echo his film titles - Billabong, Chinese Firedrill etc. A soft-focus female nude, reminiscent of an Edward Weston photograph, becomes increasingly scratched as the footage runs, a memento mori of the plastic material itself. Much, the film tells us, is beautiful, and much will be forgotten.” (Tom Whiteside)","popularity":0.0525,"poster_path":"/n0CjXvMVGhv6eqrMdr6T88BuchN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left Handed Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1579933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shellie Fleming","original_name":"Shellie Fleming","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/31ERLiaSgujBba5cBmKs1k1kQRa.jpg","credit_id":"5a6655d4c3a368572d0041a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pCFpcgC0JV58zXsnmSVGvtaeSrI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n0CjXvMVGhv6eqrMdr6T88BuchN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
