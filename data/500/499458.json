Diving into the NFB’s vast archive, she parses the complicated cinematic representation of the Inuit, harvesting fleeting truths and fortuitous accidents from a range of sources—newsreels, propaganda, ethnographic docs, and work by Indigenous filmmakers. Embedding historic footage into original animation, she conjures up a vision of hope and beautiful possibility.","popularity":0.1952,"poster_path":"/8akhde3VMcj11YdVHxWLm5w2trS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Thousand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962674,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kat Baulu","original_name":"Kat Baulu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a60d226c3a368537b000f49","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962668,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Asinnajaq","original_name":"Asinnajaq","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rK3lfd1kp85I5De3lBKk6ywygfq.jpg","credit_id":"5efe4ee4a284eb003691f956","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928861,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annie Jean","original_name":"Annie Jean","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efe4fd551c01f0037366a88","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962668,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Asinnajaq","original_name":"Asinnajaq","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rK3lfd1kp85I5De3lBKk6ywygfq.jpg","credit_id":"5efe4ea6a76ac50036fe7929","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962668,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Asinnajaq","original_name":"Asinnajaq","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rK3lfd1kp85I5De3lBKk6ywygfq.jpg","credit_id":"5efe4f1b5437f500369418f5","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2699371,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Patrick Defasten","original_name":"Patrick Defasten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efe4f74be7f350035a90332","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Ng","original_name":"Jonathan Ng","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efe4f63d6d64d0036d1241c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667427,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Catherine Van Der Donckt","original_name":"Catherine Van Der Donckt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efe502d51c01f00363641a0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116370,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annette Clarke","original_name":"Annette Clarke","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efe506951c01f0035363975","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387454,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Alary","original_name":"Olivier Alary","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efe5020a76ac50035fdf47f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1819832,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karla Baumgardner","original_name":"Karla Baumgardner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efe50449dee580035cfc8c8","department":"Sound","job":"Foley Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667427,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Catherine Van Der Donckt","original_name":"Catherine Van Der Donckt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efe50359dee580037cfb26c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18557456","wikidata_id":"Q48314137","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":888,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/unVyOhCzj1ZhnfUpbifAlRYhxOi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":638},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8akhde3VMcj11YdVHxWLm5w2trS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xH1QsdMbFWDDNcg0ib3kL3X0XoI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3355,"name":"inuit"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
