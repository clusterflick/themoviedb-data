He gets lessons in handiwork, keeps having to clean the home and is locked in a bare room at night. However, he doesn’t like the strict regime and runs away, deep into the forests of Brandenburg. Close to an airport, on the edge of a small village, he meets a lonely old man who takes pity on him. In their ramshackle dwelling, they are free of rules and obligations.
