An extra night will be charged for all late departures.\" Jean-Claude Rousseau has used this banal, well-known notice as a synopsis for his film. Taken out of context, thereby rendering it mysterious, it is an ideal introduction to this letter, which consists of two shots – the front and behind of a window in a hotel in Turin – and an insert. Here, Rousseau continues to explore \"basic film techniques\" but in this case, he abandons super eight to film in DV, a new technique and a new quest for harmony between visuals and sounds.
