Through the figure of the SDA Church appear the themes of hope for a better life and the desire to flee the daily mundane, which here manifests in a religious mode, but takes form elsewhere in the practice of particular dietary rules and extreme sports. Shot mostly in 3D, the film combines scenes recorded at SDA Church sites in the USA, Polynesia, and the Kingdom of Tonga with images of food, surfing, and medical tests; together, they immerse us in a parallel world of hope and belief â€“ of transparencies and opacities. Meanwhile, text scrolling at the bottom of the screen materializes both a source of information and a desire to escape from it.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/2I4C2FNUxyP1HjBoYGpGpUVCsaN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saturday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camille Henrot","original_name":"Camille Henrot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/eQsi9mIFaqWTdFyi2UEMqFNlcur.jpg","credit_id":"5a5e03290e0a267f6100aee0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":984013,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pascal Auffray","original_name":"Pascal Auffray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5e035d0e0a267f5800b12a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486810,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joakim","original_name":"Joakim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5e036a92514119ea00a462","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yann Chapotel","original_name":"Yann Chapotel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5e034e92514119d800a6fb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2I4C2FNUxyP1HjBoYGpGpUVCsaN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
