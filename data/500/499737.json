Their Holocaust-surviving parents were abused by the Nazis, then became abusers themselves—their fear and grief transformed into aggression and anger towards their children. For the first time on-screen, children of Holocaust survivors talk openly about the mental and physical suffering they experienced. Stories of abuse contrast with cheerful-looking black-and-white photos of the families. Even the grandchildren appear to be suffering from their parents’ burden of sorrow and pain. The children's attempt to talk about the past, as with Eitan and his ailing mother and Miri with her son, seem futile. The palpable inability to make contact is almost unbearable. Shadows asks the unavoidable questions: how long will the Holocaust continue to exert its evil influence on future generations, and how can the demons of the past be exorcised?","popularity":0.0555,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":74097,"logo_path":"/scT0L450Zhalb58MdiCApRiNIk0.png","name":"Cinemax","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1481807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Noa Aharoni","original_name":"Noa Aharoni","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6278379251410b1c00056f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1481807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Noa Aharoni","original_name":"Noa Aharoni","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a627840c3a3687f8a00050e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963486,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"David Zriff","original_name":"David Zriff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a62785bc3a3687f71000541","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963487,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Zriff","original_name":"David Zriff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6278680e0a2619fe00063e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963488,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Zriff","original_name":"David Zriff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6278760e0a2619f50005ec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963490,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yoram Ivry","original_name":"Yoram Ivry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a62788fc3a3687fa3000553","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963491,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Noy","original_name":"David Noy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a62789d0e0a2619f8000643","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
