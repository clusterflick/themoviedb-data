As often in Dwoskin’s films, the use of masks, make-up and costumes allows the characters to playfully transform themselves. Shot in colour film, C-film exuberates swinging London energy. In the second part of the film, the women appear to be watching the rushes of the film on an editing table. ”We are making a movie” we hear them say. As Dwoskin points out, “C-film asks how much is acting acted”, an ongoing question in Dwoskin’s cinema. Produced by Alan Power, with Esther Anderson & Sally Geeson.","popularity":0.3031,"poster_path":"/fOw5CqynUt3ExIQxBMaRwKnQJt2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"C-Film","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Geeson","original_name":"Sally Geeson","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":"/3UzWL6fD0yHgo7594nKWJyGHrCx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a6156a6c3a368538300c69c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1206261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ester Anderson","original_name":"Ester Anderson","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/xLqS96N62npKBnu8gojNiU4he9C.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec5c449d2147c0022b86726","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Dwoskin","original_name":"Stephen Dwoskin","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":"/czK2KmlaMJtYOHQeebFlshC8ku6.jpg","credit_id":"5a6156c792514153a50095a3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Dwoskin","original_name":"Stephen Dwoskin","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":"/czK2KmlaMJtYOHQeebFlshC8ku6.jpg","credit_id":"5a6156bcc3a368537b00ac68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Dwoskin","original_name":"Stephen Dwoskin","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":"/czK2KmlaMJtYOHQeebFlshC8ku6.jpg","credit_id":"5a6156cf0e0a26102500cc19","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183716,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan Power","original_name":"Alan Power","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6156df9251410e2000c684","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335726,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ron Geesin","original_name":"Ron Geesin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a615706c3a368537b00aca4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0065510","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ygTOtMpQkBRARcMCLwgTCQvgkY9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fOw5CqynUt3ExIQxBMaRwKnQJt2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":17974,"name":"makeup"},{"id":227202,"name":"structural film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
