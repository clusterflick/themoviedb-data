This law of impunity prevented the clarification demanded by the relatives of those who had disappeared and been murdered by the former regime. A public initiative arose calling for a referendum in which the law be subject to the vote of the people. Unas preguntas uses U-matic footage, mostly of interviews recorded on the streets of Uruguay between 1987 and 1989, to present a time capsule of the period.","popularity":0.2816,"poster_path":"/ykCacHkd4r1xegL7Jv9H29BvrNK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51666,"logo_path":"/jFrQ2vAaevoPqqbmpr2JnFIj7C5.png","name":"Weltfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":237,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One or Two Questions","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"One or Two Questions","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288372,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Graciela Salsamendi","original_name":"Graciela Salsamendi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Interviewer","credit_id":"5cb3259dc3a3681e7aaf6b11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Barhoum","original_name":"María Barhoum","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Interviewer","credit_id":"5cb325ab9251412fa327782f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Konrad","original_name":"Kristina Konrad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6223789251416800000a04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Konrad","original_name":"Kristina Konrad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad2d17a925141736401ccaf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1013031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Frölke","original_name":"René Frölke","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad2d10d925141736a01ce8b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1013031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Frölke","original_name":"René Frölke","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b07ccc0925141721f0043bd","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288372,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Graciela Salsamendi","original_name":"Graciela Salsamendi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb3258b0e0a2626cac86e83","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Barhoum","original_name":"María Barhoum","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb3254ec3a36808a2acd96d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8286436","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/ykCacHkd4r1xegL7Jv9H29BvrNK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":7992,"name":"uruguay"},{"id":156887,"name":"military dictatorship"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
