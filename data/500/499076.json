In 2015, 8 staff were assaulted every hour – a new record high.  At The Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham – one of the UK’s biggest hospitals – they think they have the answer. Here a private security force of 46 uniformed guards, and a sophisticated CCTV system, keep staff and patients safe.  A colourful mixture of characters ranging from ex-soldiers, to bouncers, to former elite sportsmen, it’s the security team’s job to keep the hospital running smoothly.  With more than 2 million visitors they have to deal with all aspects of crime and anti-social behaviour. All against a back drop of life changing and life saving procedures.","popularity":0.7649,"poster_path":"/sXejO5WhlXkIQmy8XD7b2HeQBzk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100060,"logo_path":null,"name":"TCB Media Rights","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":64506,"logo_path":"/qBZveqsC3UNY7fx6QvMrAXzX7Gl.png","name":"Nine Lives Media","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The security staff of Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, U.K., is constantly kept on its feet by aggressive patients.
