During the Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957–59, over three thousand people were sent to Jiabiangou for re-education through labor. These people were labeled rightists, counterrevolutionaries, and anti-party dissidents. Over a three-year period, more than two thousand died from abuse and hunger; only a few hundred were rescued in the end. The film includes interviews with the few remaining Jiabiangou survivors and their children, and presents the conflict between the preservation and destruction of memory.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/uT5Cg5C4zyfJ9oKX0lKBeW0B9z2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":221769,"logo_path":null,"name":"独立制作","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2017-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":409,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jiabiangou Elegy: Life and Death of the Rightists","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Jiabiangou Elegy: Life and Death of the Rightists","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Jiabiangou ji shi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1128425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fengming He","original_name":"Fengming He","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a60a6e1c3a368786b015c77","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1961158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ai Xiaoming","original_name":"Ai Xiaoming","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5e06d792514119e400a89a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1961158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ai Xiaoming","original_name":"Ai Xiaoming","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5e153392514119e400b49c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1961158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ai Xiaoming","original_name":"Ai Xiaoming","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1e31564bfa540037f48c1f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7877136","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dQrv0UBb2CEpvritGEg0sQpXgEn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c4w1GP1TS3D4lmW91dYV8absCNG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uT5Cg5C4zyfJ9oKX0lKBeW0B9z2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":869}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
