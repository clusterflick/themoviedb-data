Despite discouragement from her family, Walaa applies - and gets in. But her own rebellious behavior and a complicated relationship with her mother are a challenge, as are the circumstances under which she  lives. Following Walaa from 15 to 21, this first-ever look inside the Palestinian police academy brings us the story of a young woman navigating formidable obstacles, learning which rules to break and follow, and disproving the negative predictions from her surroundings and the world at large.","popularity":0.3167,"poster_path":"/5SiXqObK18iVPVSxFOTJCElODwh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94525,"logo_path":"/qxEhxuaApqR7GaYMJ5eyfKgQofd.png","name":"Wildling Pictures","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2018-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Walaa Wants","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4383312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walaa Khaled Fawzy Tanji","original_name":"Walaa Khaled Fawzy Tanji","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"655848b00816c7011a0d444a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4383329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Latifa Abu Draa","original_name":"Latifa Abu Draa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":32,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65584c7a7f054018d3428d4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4383330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammad Tanji","original_name":"Mohammad Tanji","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":33,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65584c820816c700fd319a8e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4383331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samia Khaled Tanji","original_name":"Samia Khaled Tanji","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":34,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65584c8bb5400214d3ca8079","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4383333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noaam Tanji","original_name":"Noaam Tanji","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":35,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65584c9a7f054018d41f7f43","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1616017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christy Garland","original_name":"Christy Garland","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655848e253866e011c08d8eb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310988,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Anders V.
