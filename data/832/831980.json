For centuries, this cult item has been handcrafted right here, attracting tourists from all over the world. Ever since the boom of the 1980s has faded, the cuckoo clock has gradually lost its appeal and magic. And so has the place, which now resembles a ghost town. Its residents however still believe in their clock: Vendors, clockmakers and tourist guides alike fight to preserve their beloved heritage. Between abandoned restaurants and souvenir shops they hope for new tourists, while the clock continues ticking away.","popularity":0.7336,"poster_path":"/tRARSwtmw7JDFqWeelHTLFkJW0V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zürcher Hochschule der Künste ZHdK Departement Darstellende Künste und Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everything ticks in Triberg, the birthplace of the cuckoo clock.
