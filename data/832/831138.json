In 1942, at the height of WWII, he throws what will turn out to be the last masquerade in Palestine. Inspired by an archival photograph, A Sketch of Manners (Alfred Rochâ€™s Last Masquerade) recreates an unconventional bon vivant aspect of Palestinian urban life before 1948. Posing silently for a group photo, the unmasked and melancholic pierrots accidentally personify the premonition of an uncertain future.","popularity":0.1244,"poster_path":"/kqiXw4O67XLtUyrxJXaSnxpA3Fp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2013-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A moment from history animated by actors in the present juxtaposes the class structures and contradictions of the cultural scene of Palestine, then and today.","title":"A Sketch of Manners (Alfred Roch's Last Masquerade)","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3095398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hakim Bishara","original_name":"Hakim Bishara","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Alfred Roch","credit_id":"60a449198dbc330057152e4b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3095400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anders Ribu","original_name":"Anders Ribu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"60a4492500bfe8002ad1db72","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1357477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jumana Manna","original_name":"Jumana Manna","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/vzZuqsdx7u7HAQQRa0lhdkjo8fm.jpg","credit_id":"60a448386ee3d7007793c641","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1357477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jumana Manna","original_name":"Jumana Manna","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/vzZuqsdx7u7HAQQRa0lhdkjo8fm.jpg","credit_id":"60a44851590086002925c142","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1357477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jumana Manna","original_name":"Jumana Manna","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/vzZuqsdx7u7HAQQRa0lhdkjo8fm.jpg","credit_id":"60a448674b0c630078cf6afa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ihab Jadallah","original_name":"Ihab Jadallah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a4493f5900860040a47446","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3095403,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jakob Langvik","original_name":"Jakob Langvik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a44951543398003eafd7a6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323420,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jochen Jezussek","original_name":"Jochen Jezussek","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a4495f764b99005792322f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman M.
