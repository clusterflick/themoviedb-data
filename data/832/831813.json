The family scatters like the dust of Anatolia. His sisters, Kerekia and Victoria, die of typhus. Giannis and Isaac are separated in 1919 and do not see each other for more than 60 years. Giannis comes to Greece, but he never stops looking for his brother and writing letters to him.

again.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/twx1laVUGng5vHuojSdyjq67ZaO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2019-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letter
