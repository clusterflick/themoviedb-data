The current methods of baited drum-lines and nets have not only been scientifically proven to be ineffective in protecting swimmers and surfers, leaving them at risk in the sea, but these outdated solutions continue to be allowed to negatively impact entire marine ecosystems—including the Great Barrier Reef.  Follows some of the biggest names in ocean conservation, such as Sea Shepherd, Ocean Ramsey and Madison Stewart. We will join these experts as they explore and expose this scarcely understood topic. We will also learn the importance of sharks in our oceans while uncovering the longest marine cull in history.","popularity":1.019,"poster_path":"/wv23cLDFF3tFSfgDwmsGmGkLKKM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In-depth knowledge and expertise to shed light on this scarcely understood topic","title":"Envoy: Shark Cull","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Bana","original_name":"Eric Bana","popularity":2.5671,"profile_path":"/xIjQVywxkymHbbSO7lD2F9f377W.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"60a61bb5cb75d1006c62e4d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2631956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul de Gelder","original_name":"Paul de Gelder","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":"/efnpMmSRC741rDer9NuOvR1lgIa.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60a61c2c9a64c10040b8813d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":108324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Layne Beachley","original_name":"Layne Beachley","popularity":0.0612,"profile_path":"/kMqQ4N6O1VjnkbbnoDAX31ViVF9.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60a61c344b0c63002a89936e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madison Stewart","original_name":"Madison Stewart","popularity":0.1484,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60a61c3b9a64c1002963b12d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ocean Ramsey","original_name":"Ocean Ramsey","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60a61c41b87aec0079ed91fe","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Carroll","original_name":"Tom Carroll","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/jU9HZqbwKGwDM7a7ZKEkcjYlL4O.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60a61c49b87aec00594b687e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2427632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Oliphant","original_name":"Juan Oliphant","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60a61c6acb5c8e0029b3a466","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3096768,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Keoni TeTawa Bowthorpe","original_name":"Keoni TeTawa Bowthorpe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a61c0bcb5c8e004099569f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3096766,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Reese Lowe","original_name":"Reese Lowe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a61bf5cb75d1006c62e545","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3096769,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andy B.
