This took place immediately following the high point of the countrywide uprising in which people responded to the murders of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville, and countless other Black people around the United States. In response, a new wave of protest and revolt broke out across Atlanta, in which the Wendy’s burned to the ground. Armed Black demonstrators occupied the site of the Wendy’s, mourning for Rayshard Brooks and seeking to create spaces of Black empowerment.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/eusHEZiiEK1mGIWqUQRETC5nQYf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Now: The Story of an Armed No-Cop Zone in Atlanta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":1556,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eusHEZiiEK1mGIWqUQRETC5nQYf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1030}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
