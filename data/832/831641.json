In the legend, a pregnant woman is immured to make the walls of the monastery stand. After further research, I came across the belief of the “stahie,” or shadow, an ancient Eastern European belief and practice that in order for the walls of a building to stand, someone has to be built into the walls either physically (i.e their body), or metaphysically (i.e their shadow). As I delved into the legend and this belief, I found myself facing my many shadows - my many possibilities and my many fears.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/sIehn6wF2Xw6O8RL2E0uvS4oK0Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SHADOW","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2408025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Jandasek","original_name":"Francesca Jandasek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a6676b6ee3d70057f8bb02","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sIehn6wF2Xw6O8RL2E0uvS4oK0Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CSULB Dance Film Festival","release_date":"2020-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
