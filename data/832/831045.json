A group of young students, aged 18 or 19, set off in a hurry, moving south on foot, crossing Xiangqian and Yunnan, and eventually forming a temporary university on the Kunming plateau - the Southwest Union University, a joint venture between Tsinghua, Peking University and Nankai. They crossed a city to listen to the \"best Chinese language class ever\", to listen to Toselli's \"Serenade\", and to join the Flying Tigers.  For these \"post-90s\" seniors, who are now in their nineties, SWU is not a dusty piece of history, but a memory of youth that is still as fresh as ever. Yang Zhenning, Xu Yuanchong, Pan Jiluan, Yang Coix, Wang Xiji and Ma Zhitu - 16 students of the University with an average age of over 96 years old are cast together to take you back to a time when war was raging and stars were shining.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/zrlL9Rl0m3xphtfSTSpJYUbAuyb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2021-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Day When We Were Young","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"One Day When We Were Young","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3095124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yang Chenning","original_name":"Yang Chenning","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60a40a386ee3d700779389fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3095125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xu Yuanchong","original_name":"Xu Yuanchong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60a40a42d48cee006df7414c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2181992,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Bei Xu","original_name":"徐蓓","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/b5JGn2mdUnUrzU7Em4KPRjyV8SW.jpg","credit_id":"60a40a15325a510041e56037","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e54OT0o4Js5hPYjJPsoGJiZB3ZG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zrlL9Rl0m3xphtfSTSpJYUbAuyb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
