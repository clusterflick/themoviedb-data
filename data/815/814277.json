A life, that offered a future.  The film he made about his journey from Africa to Europe gets shown all over the world and throughout Germany, where Abou lives as an asylum seeker. His life oscillates between that of an artist with a voice, who is invited to screenings and events, and the isolation and boredom in a remote refugee centre.  An essayistic reflection about Europe’s invisible borders and filmmaking as an act of self-empowerment.","popularity":0.083,"poster_path":"/9iEliXVDVmvVuvX5b8CZM5BZH7x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"}],"release_date":"2019-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My New European Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576219,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abou Bakar Sidibé","original_name":"Abou Bakar Sidibé","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"607173c3839d930040dc3016","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576219,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abou Bakar Sidibé","original_name":"Abou Bakar Sidibé","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606b238d12c6040057339d9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576219,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abou Bakar Sidibé","original_name":"Abou Bakar Sidibé","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606b23990257640079799d63","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moritz Siebert","original_name":"Moritz Siebert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606b23a40c3ec8006e81d97b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10263600","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":945,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9iEliXVDVmvVuvX5b8CZM5BZH7x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":668}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
