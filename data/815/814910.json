Akbar’s illness makes him lose his job so Tina has to work in a garment factory. Akbar’s effort to find a job is fruitless and he passes away shortly after. His three children Mimi, Memet, and Ayu cannot stand their stepmother’s fickleness. They leave quietly to find the family of their biological mother. This is not easy since they don’t have her address. They work at any job to survive - housemaid, shoe shiner, parking boy etc. One day they meet John who buys and sells used newspapers. Mimi and Memet are given a small business of selling ice and pastries. Then Memed accidently takes the wrong train but fortunately, a rich man adopts him. However, Memed returns home as he misses his younger siblings. The reunion is short since Ayu passes away.","popularity":0.3827,"poster_path":"/pvUxTuVFN3s7G5FXTNheOwRyRzt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7872,"logo_path":"/5zodgZbBTlY5PAviS6KxOCyOlGH.png","name":"Rapi Films","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1980-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"3 parentless Children, Go to City to Survive, A man with Limp","title":"Motherless Children","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","title":"Motherless Children","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.N.
