On a winter night, on a farm in the heart of Tuscany, a gander named Ottorino defended a chicken coop from a fox attack and lost his beak in the fight, risking certain death. Thanks to the inventiveness of a veterinarian, Otto survived. Instead of a beak, a copper prosthesis was implanted in its place. The gander was celebrated by all the animals in the farm as an example of strength and courage, with a new superhero name: Copperbeak. But what would happen if we interviewed the fox and the other animals to have their point of view? It would turn out that Otto is not really a hero after all. But there is always time to prove your courage and become one.","popularity":0.2211,"poster_path":"/fvtZDhW4U5l6v5Xu4ZtD30OpJcK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8904,"logo_path":"/4IvWDPpPklykgC4CdlysDN3CEGv.png","name":"ideaCinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":137442,"logo_path":null,"name":"Movimenti Production","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"The true story of a hero... or maybe not.","title":"Copperbeak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263402,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adriano Candiago","original_name":"Adriano Candiago","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606c640e12c6040029643c46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263402,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adriano Candiago","original_name":"Adriano Candiago","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606c6415d100b600580401f1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3040415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alberto Briganti","original_name":"Alberto Briganti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606c6427025764002b8ca2b2","department":"Writing","job":"Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322753,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacopo Saraceni","original_name":"Jacopo Saraceni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606c643644ea540029171503","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3040416,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Davide Rosio","original_name":"Davide Rosio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606c64479ca759005786dd53","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fvtZDhW4U5l6v5Xu4ZtD30OpJcK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
