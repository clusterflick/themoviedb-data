Go!","overview":"Go Dyke! Go! is a humorous commentary on lesbian relationships in the context of children’s literature. Taking off from the popular children’s book Go Dog! Go! (by P.D. Eastman), this animation paints a sarcastic, pointed and comic picture of queer life in the 90s. Familiar pop imagery and everyday signifiers are a point of entry for a discussion of the patterns of serial monogamy and lesbian representation. Go Dyke! Go! plays with the genre of animation and poses a game of semiotics to deconstruct the tropes of children's books and heterosexism.","popularity":0.0658,"poster_path":"/6ArQ8sSoeWwFnlnQSlFSHkzvaiq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1998-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Go Dyke!
