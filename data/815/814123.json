Pierpont Morgan: Emperor of Wall Street","overview":"He single-handedly saved the United States from bankruptcy on two occasions, but was often accused of being a monopolist.

He assembled one of America's largest fortunes and purchased an art collection to rival any in the world. BIOGRAPHY tells the complete, compelling story of the celebrated deal maker and money man. See rare footage of the financier in his element on Wall Street, and trace his rise to power and prominence through interviews with biographers and historians. Hear how he brokered an agreement between two competing railroads by inviting both presidents for a cruise on his yacht and refusing to let them off until they came to terms! And get a privileged look at his private life.","popularity":0.1235,"poster_path":"/1GpfR7MI9EEIBU82V6moUa0tyN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Story of the 19th-century power broker who once controlled 70 percent of all the steel and 60 percent of all stocks in America.","title":"J.
