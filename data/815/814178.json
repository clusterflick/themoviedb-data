Unexpectedly, an unusual piece of luggage ends up on Annabelle's show. When it is opened, valuable designer clothes and precious pieces of jewelry are revealed. Things that are not normally found in lost suitcases. But the owner doesn't get in touch, so Annabelle sets off on her own initiative to find the owner. She is assisted by Elsa, a self-proclaimed fashion expert. A clue that the suitcase could belong to the deceased writer Elizabeth Marlowe leads the two women to Thomas, a shy writer. He is Elizabeth Marlowe's great-grandson and lives in seclusion on the Cornish coast. Annabelle is immediately fascinated by him. But when she learns that Thomas is in a committed relationship, Annabelle recalls her resolution to remain single.","popularity":0.31,"poster_path":"/zthnjezNzoCqrJfnqFDrPA6C721.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21931,"logo_path":"/t4LXePf1f6W81RODGtTAWK5DIRt.png","name":"FFP New
