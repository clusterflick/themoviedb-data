In an environment of devastated telluric forces (one-hundred-year-old trees from the Fontainebleau forest were uprooted by the storm of 1999 winter). There is a superb officiating priest in a black tuxedo. The film refers to the everlasting cycle of death, the extraction of a corpse by a young nymph remind’s us of Caravaggio’s paintings, this ceremony is full of ablutions and jewellery; a flowy, golden path to a wonderful mirror through which the miracle of resurrection takes place.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le rituel de Fontainebleau","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1340468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Marti","original_name":"Stéphane Marti","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/goQU4fcq4kFed6jfkioPKbcdpk6.jpg","credit_id":"606b123f7f2d4a006e381fc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0387543","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
