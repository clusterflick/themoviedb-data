Yi has a crush on a static girl in his temporary residence and often visits her after his mother falls asleep. He wishes time starts moving again so the girl will play with him. As his mother finds out about his secret, they got into a big quarrel. All of a sudden, Dr. Cheng and his gang find them through the noise.  During the standoff, Yi realizes he stopped time when the world was about to be destroyed. Dr. Cheng attempts to kill Yi to keep time static. Yiâ€™s mother sacrifices herself to save him.
