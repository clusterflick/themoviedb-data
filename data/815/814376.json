As war rages all over Europe and Himmlerâ€™s health declines while his authority grows, Kersten finds himself in a unique position to influence decision-making at the highest level inside the Third Reich. Playing a very dangerous game that may cost him his life at every turn and using his medical skills as a weapon, the doctor manages to influence Himmler, turn him against Hitler, and, in turn, save many thousands of lives.","popularity":0.7563,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":114124,"logo_path":"/kFBKWa13gxWg1tB8GQOMqgPm4y8.png","name":"Jerico Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"","title":"The Man with the Miraculous Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Woody Harrelson","original_name":"Woody Harrelson","popularity":3.2568,"profile_path":"/igxYDQBbTEdAqaJxaW6ffqswmUU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Felix Kersten","credit_id":"606b711a0c3ec8006e8258ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Serkis","original_name":"Andy Serkis","popularity":3.1015,"profile_path":"/eNGqhebQ4cDssjVeNFrKtUvweV5.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Heinrich Himmler","credit_id":"663e8a899bbf8cc820f2ea52","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":342158,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fabrice Gianfermi","original_name":"Fabrice Gianfermi","popularity":0.2506,"profile_path":"/s5aOINBUJZYrPjWcDqN59osWde4.jpg","credit_id":"606b70451cc4ff007885e313","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36859,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philippe Rousselet","original_name":"Philippe Rousselet","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":"/c4r2JyEaPpaKh1JbYdXgVacp3Ht.jpg","credit_id":"606b701903bf84005759c4cc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64576,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Jehelmann","original_name":"Eric Jehelmann","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":"/buyNP36XqXcZZW3tSKaOJXyc4BW.jpg","credit_id":"606b6ffb1cc4ff0029c65c4c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34110,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oren Moverman","original_name":"Oren Moverman","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/40C07hmGi2n7VZTc7DyTsZQFsLK.jpg","credit_id":"606b70d89ca7590029e96548","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34110,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oren Moverman","original_name":"Oren Moverman","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/40C07hmGi2n7VZTc7DyTsZQFsLK.jpg","credit_id":"663e8ab3cfac1486d92f7095","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407319,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeremy Plager","original_name":"Jeremy Plager","popularity":0.2581,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e8ae49bbf8cc820f2ea70","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14353996","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
