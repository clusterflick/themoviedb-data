Driven by a vision of resistance, the encounters seek possibilities of renewal and question what connects us when the world seems to be falling apart. With mushrooms and their allies the film invites to imagine a myco-cultural (r)evolution. What if the fungus could help us address and radically change our relationship to this world?","popularity":0.3794,"poster_path":"/demHTrpcNFZXFjBS8FOsDbjJM3p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85595,"logo_path":"/b7WeslTaEl82WgOywyfWMDwXkWX.png","name":"Intermezzo Films","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2021-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mushroom Speaks","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2091608,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marion Neumann","original_name":"Marion Neumann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606bcfe803bf840040db4b05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415385,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olga Kokcharova","original_name":"Olga Kokcharova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ffe14aaf2da8009c41886b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2091608,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marion Neumann","original_name":"Marion Neumann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ffe08a136545001d43b916","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2091608,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marion Neumann","original_name":"Marion Neumann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ffe0f700508a001b863604","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415382,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katia Monla Guisolan","original_name":"Katia Monla Guisolan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ffe0a7d3719700691f7d21","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415385,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olga Kokcharova","original_name":"Olga Kokcharova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ffe0e21e92250042542d16","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1119048,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Peter","original_name":"Luc Peter","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ffe0c7d34eb3009d23a9b5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2091608,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marion Neumann","original_name":"Marion Neumann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ffe10d109230004342746a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7612,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Orsola Valenti","original_name":"Orsola Valenti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ffe126d371970096750beb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14553000","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2339,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/demHTrpcNFZXFjBS8FOsDbjJM3p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1654}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":333,"name":"mushroom"},{"id":9696,"name":"magic mushroom"},{"id":287461,"name":"fungi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
