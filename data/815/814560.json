The filmmaker, son of Bosnian parents, struggles to communicate as he lost his mother-tongue due to a heavy stutter. Despite their speech and hearing limitations, a bond develops between the young man and the veteran, as he shares his world of the lake: full of large catfish, wild horses, wide silences, and dangerous thunderstorms. Where for the fisherman the lake stands for a withdrawal from a fractured country, a land of war; for the filmmaker it precisely means the return to that broken place, the land of his parents. They look for ways to communicate, while the camera mediates their growing bond. Taking the shape of a gentle western, \"Looking for Horses\" is a poetic documentary on trauma, survival, and connection.","popularity":0.2465,"poster_path":"/sXQtY7PQKg9pfij56djzw06eE9L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arttrace","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia
