A dozen years later it operated well over 30 \"Jumbos\" and eventually had one of the world's largest 747 fleets. Until a few years ago it had operated most types of the aircraft including the 100, 200B, 200F, 300, 400, 400ERF and 400BCF. Soon though the type will be leaving the fleet with most aircraft already gone, freighter service is scheduled to end in 2015 and passenger service sometime in 2016 ending nearly 50 years of operation! AirFrance 747s have been seen nearly everyone on earth! We are very lucky to have Captain George Mercovik, a 747 instructor, on this program. He and is 2 copilots will give you a great tour and presentation of this fantastic aircraft!","popularity":0.2527,"poster_path":"/nOwVCLzU9s07tRGSR6yWI7sZaZg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Just Planes Video Inc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":250,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Air France 747-400","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3040580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Mercovik","original_name":"George Mercovik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Captain","credit_id":"606c77ce1cc4ff00403af682","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2884395,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michel Moskal","original_name":"Michel Moskal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606c78a29ca75900409c1a99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3040569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Just Planes","original_name":"Just Planes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606c78c0ad87f7002978738c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nOwVCLzU9s07tRGSR6yWI7sZaZg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10168,"name":"aviation"},{"id":180076,"name":"airline"},{"id":278738,"name":"cockpit"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
