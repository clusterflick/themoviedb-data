There is certainly no word of a plot or unambiguous content. Influenced by the Italian film maker Michelangelo Antonioni, he draws a picture here of mental and physical oppression. A monitor in an empty room alternately shows the faces of a woman and a man. Their lips are moving, but you cannot hear their voices. Their faces are 'blindfolded', and 'tied up' with a rope which is fastened around the monitor. Then there are images of the woman in the empty room in which she looks at herself on the screen and in a broken mirror. Locked up in this circuit and her own thoughts, she is unable to make contact.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6KLA7HNuJdLsQCWbC4F2AxzgJxl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Traumasyl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3040986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christiaan Bastiaans","original_name":"Christiaan Bastiaans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606cc17aad59b5002abbe504","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6KLA7HNuJdLsQCWbC4F2AxzgJxl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
