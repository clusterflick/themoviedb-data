This seems unlikely, given they are both homeless men mired in the bleak landscape of Los Angeles' Skid Row. Moreover, the source of Donald's optimism is a mere $20 bill (called a \"Jackson\") which he bummed off a passing businessman (Steve Guttenberg) earlier that day. But Donald vows that with it, they can do anything, and drags a reluctant Sam off in search of adventure.","popularity":1.1997,"poster_path":"/vdK7UWBz9R2xlKbf8DAGe1UU8FU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152123,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beltek Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":152124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Danzel Phonographic Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is going to be the best day of your life.","title":"Jackson","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Primus","original_name":"Barry Primus","popularity":0.4305,"profile_path":"/aHGNNA8YkPQfRavLvLhKodoCkdf.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Donald","credit_id":"606ac2979ca759006e5893a4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Robinson","original_name":"Charles Robinson","popularity":0.5573,"profile_path":"/zEy4ZnzuhhyueT5bef1jzQUFW7.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"606ac2b9fb3f6100293eb0f5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Guttenberg","original_name":"Steve Guttenberg","popularity":0.9873,"profile_path":"/ghTMepliFNcRQHNELs8pgNDsZyW.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Businessman","credit_id":"606ac2c944ea54006d447943","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debra Jo Rupp","original_name":"Debra Jo Rupp","popularity":0.861,"profile_path":"/jVGXbJvfIoRI6PtKbwUYGNyiI67.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Nice Lady","credit_id":"606ac2d40c3ec80057086e9d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":155456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neal Matarazzo","original_name":"Neal Matarazzo","popularity":0.1947,"profile_path":"/3sqfl4GUHwzRfTCxd7bzRij43mx.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Stockbroker","credit_id":"606ac2e2025764007979606f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038474,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kazutaka Tsuboi","original_name":"Kazutaka Tsuboi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606ac23eebb99d005990a0ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038475,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ryan Pilon","original_name":"Ryan Pilon","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606ac25303bf84002978d365","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67853,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roderick Davis","original_name":"Roderick Davis","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606ac28098f1f1002965d38e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"J.F.
