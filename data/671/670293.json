The domed city was home to the last of the human race, where they lived in comfort, served by their robotic servants. Until one day a mysterious force turns the robots against their masters, and the machines cast the people out of Red Sector A into the wastelands outside. Years later, the robots have collapsed into dust without human maintenance, leaving two young people - Woody and Andrea - to live in the city. But the city is on the verge of a exploding as the shield generator approaches meltdown. Andrea and Woody have a few hours to escape Red Sector A, but the unknown force that caused the revolution is still present, and has it's own plans for them.","popularity":1.1113,"poster_path":"/yCiqooZV94T2v5Dz38iI0eswogU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18390,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atkinson Film Arts","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Andrea and Woody have little time to escape Red Sector A, but an unknown force has it's own plans for them.
