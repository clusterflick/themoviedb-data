After facing personal problems such as the death of his father, one day he caught a glimpse of a cosmic image, which he named “the planetarium of God”. He was incarcerated at Praia Vermelha hospital, in Rio de Janeiro, and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. In 1946, he began to attend the studio created by Nise da Silveira, becoming fond of it as if it were his home. His works are marked by the presence of mandalas, signs of his attempts to organize psychic chaos.","popularity":0.4402,"poster_path":"/8G78wy4XPouXXGUzGReh4MEQxsf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Hirszman Produções Cinematográficas","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1987-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imagens do Inconsciente: A Barca do Sol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferreira Gullar","original_name":"Ferreira Gullar","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":"/6BW0p0q6gK5hGtc8d6vRJdgIibW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrador","credit_id":"61773e08924ce600273e3725","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1180636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanda Lacerda","original_name":"Vanda Lacerda","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":"/6gKD3wSGhw1UiphdUlby5VP6m4Y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narradora","credit_id":"61773e12a097dc0065f36e3f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leon Hirszman","original_name":"Leon Hirszman","popularity":0.2344,"profile_path":"/6shOg7sxGwTW7vggtZ6z2FJrTru.jpg","credit_id":"61773e44fdc4fa008761ca87","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leon Hirszman","original_name":"Leon Hirszman","popularity":0.2344,"profile_path":"/6shOg7sxGwTW7vggtZ6z2FJrTru.jpg","credit_id":"5e3e95380c271000137b25b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0321383","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8G78wy4XPouXXGUzGReh4MEQxsf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nZSEKUWYFBFDPpe7UnpFJmaHbcX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iVYb8yPOL141W5dSgKkDVu713Ga.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":615},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bqBIQpI3L5VzZnAEfREGnSE5r1j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
