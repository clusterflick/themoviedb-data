Shunned as a \"sinful\" woman by most of the town, she turns over her son, Don, to be raised by Miss Julia, the town librarian, who tells the boy that she's his \"aunt\". Don grows up and goes to college, and when he comes back home the town gossips begin a rumor-mongering campaign. When the town policeman tries to drive Aurora out of town he is found murdered, and Don is arrested for the crime.","popularity":0.1738,"poster_path":"/uHZ9fux7mp8m58oLLZ0YNWoPzTa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tiffany Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Broken Gate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1196077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Phillips","original_name":"Dorothy Phillips","popularity":0.1,"profile_path":"/f9z3iAAzrKWjRkWlQ9V47tPsZi8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Aurora Lane","credit_id":"5fcd0b20cadb6b00431be0f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Collier Jr.","original_name":"William Collier Jr.","popularity":0.1967,"profile_path":"/zgFHpJl1Tor0AVVXq9QOV4L14SF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Don Lane","credit_id":"5fcd0b25d9554b003e57709f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Arthur","original_name":"Jean Arthur","popularity":0.3249,"profile_path":"/h46KhIQOOMPUMIdGNSN3A4zwcGQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ruth Hale","credit_id":"5e3b010ec144dd00150ec20c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillips Smalley","original_name":"Phillips Smalley","popularity":0.1997,"profile_path":"/wqmmEk0TPELGnDgVOSXGM8YYzJ2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Judge Lucius Henderson","credit_id":"5fcd0b320b7316004009ae05","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Turner","original_name":"Florence Turner","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":"/h08KXju3kinUqw7RviRxB0ATLYG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Miss Julia","credit_id":"5fcd0b37dcf875003f44c1cd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gibson Gowland","original_name":"Gibson Gowland","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/5peWO8JpDAgeb5NPGoOWvkpiyhX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ephraim Adamson","credit_id":"61a69d35c044290065f30b3a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles A.
