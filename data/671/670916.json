Grandmothers tell stories of biblical monsters while gently slapping the listener with a shoe. The daily routine of sunset ball play is interrupted only by the call of fresh fried sausages, or, perhaps, by the beckoning of a colorful alcoholic beverage. But this day is not a typical one. This day, the sea does not bring the usual boat engine, fish scull or metal briefcase ashore. Instead, it delivers a woman and a doll. A group of Mexican hipsters beach bums come upon this woman and her doll. Louise -- who may or may not be a disgruntled hippie dropping out, or a failed Ponzi schemer seeking solace in the ocean -- responds to her new surroundings with a coma-like stare.","popularity":0.3272,"poster_path":"/lejIZ7VtNsBmjGuKDwcvXxOzMiP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Living need not be so serious - surrender to the mysteries of life!","title":"Mystico Fantástico!","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1481021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimi Shlag","original_name":"Jimi Shlag","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":"/ve0FMgf8F6da8zW2Pn5OCSmi17z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Voodoo Doll","credit_id":"5e8a325e4d0e8d0014e05309","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":178076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatriz Yuste","original_name":"Beatriz Yuste","popularity":0.1965,"profile_path":"/9Z4PEDRtI9U1rCoaOOwQ9uzoY3e.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Louise","credit_id":"5e8a32b3d6590b0018ee1344","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980284,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anita Doron","original_name":"Anita Doron","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":"/99YDkGnwQ16OlFeYvyIbOPqtZBG.jpg","credit_id":"6660b78881a483433b2447a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1860290","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lejIZ7VtNsBmjGuKDwcvXxOzMiP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
