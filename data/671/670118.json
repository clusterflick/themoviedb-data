This duo may have been opening concerts with that irresistibly smooth number for years, but it never seems to lose its magic, and the crowd – an eclectic mix of teens and baby boomers alike – lapped it up.  These Philly crooners still have it in bucket-loads, so this show should have everyone from diehard Daryl Hall and John Oates fans to kids of the 80's groovin’ along in no time.\"  1. Maneater  2.
