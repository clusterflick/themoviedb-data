Lee) is a New York City firefighter who barely escaped the World Trade Center on 9/11 and instantly became a hero. Except the only reason he survived was because he panicked and ran away, a secret he kept hidden under PTSD and survivor's guilt. Years later, Samuel Lyons (Carl Ford), a photographer who crossed paths with Gus on 9/11, confronts Gus with a photo that proves Gus was a coward. Samuel blackmails Gus into telling the truth to his family, forcing him into a journey of self-discovery and acceptance which reunites him with his son Frankie (Sebasti√°n Zurita) who enlisted in the military to fight for him.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/9gs06K4HoJkZYcWhWGRg1vG0DDV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When you hit bottom the only way is up.","title":"I Was There","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2395242","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9gs06K4HoJkZYcWhWGRg1vG0DDV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
