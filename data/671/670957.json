Partly through sincerity and partly prompted by an uneasy conscience, he wants to revolutionize the traditional photo-novel by linking it to social and political reality, to \"bring social conscience to the masses\" by utilizing this traditionally manipulative and alienating mass medium. The film narrates, in a tragicomic tone, the itinerary followed by Gualberto Rodriguez in his efforts to produce his 'revolutionary' photo-novel: the story of a peasant that migrates to the city, becomes a blue-collar worker, tries to establish a union, and ends up falling in love with the factory owner's daughter. The 'revolutionary' ends up being used, manipulated, and his project fails completely.","popularity":0.1346,"poster_path":"/ihO9IUWE9jLkuxDpTqSGCAgT0nb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27880,"logo_path":"/yt24dH6cML0ovAtPMtt4quBeNdA.png","name":"Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos (CUEC)","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":88614,"logo_path":"/jpid5wWEkbpSqRTsHdJjWwzLWv8.png","name":"UNAM","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cualquier Cosa","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaime Garza","original_name":"Jaime Garza","popularity":0.288,"profile_path":"/bjdarf63j3bcoOU2gmbyf0R4UEd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gualberto Rodríguez","credit_id":"625dbc2b2d3721005162b621","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1352343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilia Toussaint","original_name":"Cecilia Toussaint","popularity":0.161,"profile_path":"/2dZRblt3alR4ihcBNasYDI1gwc0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cecilia","credit_id":"625dbc379ee0ef009a23e7bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3157011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dora Guerra","original_name":"Dora Guerra","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":"/dynqoLswxs4gRrj6JFsKImBnFdD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mónica","credit_id":"625dbc3fd38b5817ae2a9474","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2887638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Silvia Garza","original_name":"Ana Silvia Garza","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/4BkVsdCu3AMnlrmny4VVtRw0VaZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Reportera","credit_id":"625dbc4bbf09d10066c25630","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666588,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gisela Iranzo","original_name":"Gisela Iranzo","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Rocío Monteforte","credit_id":"6757ca7eabc1edadc0c535e6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87497,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"José Iván Santiago","original_name":"José Iván Santiago","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Tony","credit_id":"6759095826b9b8adaffeeb22","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":941366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salvador Garcini","original_name":"Salvador Garcini","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":"/Rc6tcF11oAcglEpl4AOxK9e9lU.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Félix Roldán","credit_id":"6759144b65ef4e91d7e8c6a6","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1636933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Sánchez","original_name":"Douglas Sánchez","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/eHz5tFuw4hyInrgHBGrch8szqpu.jpg","credit_id":"5e987b5db339030013a262ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":262794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandro Gamboa","original_name":"Alejandro Gamboa","popularity":0.1157,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67591faea174bb78f4a58858","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87497,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"José Iván Santiago","original_name":"José Iván Santiago","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759201d39b533d9424861ed","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87497,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"José Iván Santiago","original_name":"José Iván Santiago","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759202d39b533d9424861f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1636933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Sánchez","original_name":"Douglas Sánchez","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/eHz5tFuw4hyInrgHBGrch8szqpu.jpg","credit_id":"6759203839b533d9424861f8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1636933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Sánchez","original_name":"Douglas Sánchez","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/eHz5tFuw4hyInrgHBGrch8szqpu.jpg","credit_id":"6759204bad918721d0deda42","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0266431","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ihO9IUWE9jLkuxDpTqSGCAgT0nb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish;
