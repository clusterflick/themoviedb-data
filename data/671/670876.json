When his dog runs off, he ends up wandering around the town and eventually drunk. The next morning he awakens in jail and finds himself sentenced to go to Los Angeles to pick up an unknown cargo, and in return, he gets his dog back. However, on the return trip he winds up with a vintage ambulance and a fast food waitress who talks her way into coming along for the trip. The two are of course destined for romance, but sparks fly in their bickering first.","popularity":0.1938,"poster_path":"/iZnRGMXGFOm4Kf5NKn1Ag54Cxzz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":210686,"logo_path":"/3MKLTl0ggBI61Lxfi1d0444YZY.png","name":"Vagabonds Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Larga distancia","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4821202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rio Glenn","original_name":"Rio Glenn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"668dc410bbcf554806ae11d6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4821203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jade Berreau","original_name":"Jade Berreau","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"668dc41770192d709265983a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Glenn","original_name":"Scott Glenn","popularity":2.0223,"profile_path":"/keBKcMPojtRTi5ImLXOoKDmDbqU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"668dc41decf45d78fb9eb27b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4821204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Mdahuar","original_name":"Luis Mdahuar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"668dc42731dbdc1bf232a429","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4821205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Consuelo Sandoval","original_name":"Consuelo Sandoval","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"668dc42d454ff88b140d20be","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4821201,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dakota Glenn","original_name":"Dakota Glenn","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668dc408f1602d9c56c303f0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4315647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg Smith","original_name":"Greg Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668dc3fc593a1c7a70efee05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151298","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iZnRGMXGFOm4Kf5NKn1Ag54Cxzz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1175}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
