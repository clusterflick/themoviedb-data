It is Director Juan Orol's tale of a violent love triangle where two farm hands out to prove who is the most macho, and thereby win the affections of a woman. This tragic love story takes place on a tropical plantation located just outside of Havana, where its workers are housed in small, thatched-roof \"bohios\". The two rival suitors are driven by passion for the girl they both love, and soon engage in a series of challenges designed to help this young woman choose the right guy in the end. These competitions start out to include simple and benign activities at first, like dancing, singing and dueling guitars, or betting on the winning bird at a cock-fight, However, they soon escalate to more violent activities, like public brawls, and saber dueling, which set life changing events into motion for everyone.","popularity":0.4574,"poster_path":"/tXoTE8hu3ta0So6syiBS8zvPRbG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77685,"logo_path":null,"name":"España Sono
