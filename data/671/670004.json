He gives himself up, and his brother, Wally, promises to run down the killer. Wally, who suspects Mike Wesson, the foreman of the Flying X Ranch, of the crime, goes to the ranch and talks to him. While at the ranch Mike meets June Mathews, owner of the ranch, and he falls in love with her. When Wally and June are out riding, they are ambushed by Wesson, and Wally is wounded. One of Wesson's confederates later exposes Wesson's perfidy, and Wally brings the homicidal foreman to justice. Wally then weds June.","popularity":0.2179,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":43416,"logo_path":null,"name":"Action Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hurricane Horseman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Arthur","original_name":"Jean Arthur","popularity":0.3249,"profile_path":"/h46KhIQOOMPUMIdGNSN3A4zwcGQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"June Mathews","credit_id":"5e3af1480c2710001876396c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Taliaferro","original_name":"Hal Taliaferro","popularity":0.2491,"profile_path":"/xAg9Rx5g3M58oPE46eD6yJK9ea5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Wally Marden (as Wally Wales)","credit_id":"61a3fb076332f7006894ecb6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vester Pegg","original_name":"Vester Pegg","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jim Marden","credit_id":"61a3fb1fb458b8002989cedf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slim Whitaker","original_name":"Slim Whitaker","popularity":0.1287,"profile_path":"/jrDw1jXr26U7XC4lTSbwUHCohf6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mikes Wesson (as Charles Whitaker)","credit_id":"61a3fb30ed28b90091f28b4b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2940596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kewpie King","original_name":"Kewpie King","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Kewpie Cook","credit_id":"61a3fb4000508a002c1ce6de","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Robert Chandler","original_name":"James Robert Chandler","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Parson Pettigrew (as Robert Chandler)","credit_id":"61a3fb51c5c1ef0094a51906","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1295330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Fleming","original_name":"Bob Fleming","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"61a3fb62be4b360045d2b0eb","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3328484,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katherine Fanning","original_name":"Katherine Fanning","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a3fad60486380045b50650","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3328485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"A.E.
