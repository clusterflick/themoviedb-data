Its operator, the multi-billion-dollar British security firm G4S, promised the most humane treatment and the best facilities for its nearly 3,000 prisoners—and naturally at the lowest cost.  Testimonials from whistleblowers and former prisoners, and the findings of investigative journalist Ruth Hopkins expose the reality of prison privatization. Guards are underpaid, overworked and fear every day for their lives. Prisoners are a source of income, so rehabilitation isn’t a priority. Prison for Profit shows how this profit maximization system works, and what happens when governmental tasks like detention are outsourced to powerful international corporations. And what are the negative consequences for society at large?","popularity":0.3678,"poster_path":"/adIeueUqNguIHDQpMx34xtOFadI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73073,"logo_path":null,"name":"IFProductions","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prison for Profit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilse van Velzen","original_name":"Ilse van Velzen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3dd1150c271000157a81e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Femke van Velzen","original_name":"Femke van Velzen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3dd123e04aca0013d5aa7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209353,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hans Bouma","original_name":"Hans Bouma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb43e70ccb15f002285245c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1451192,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rogier Timmermans","original_name":"Rogier Timmermans","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb43e7ef3e0df001f2aebde","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilse van Velzen","original_name":"Ilse van Velzen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb43e8b66469a001de36b03","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Femke van Velzen","original_name":"Femke van Velzen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb43ea4ccb15f00228524bf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Femke van Velzen","original_name":"Femke van Velzen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb43eacf3e0df001f2aebf2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilse van Velzen","original_name":"Ilse van Velzen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb43eba0cb335001fc7fc30","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575815,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul de Heer","original_name":"Paul de Heer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb43ec966469a001ce2af88","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385782,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeroen Goeijers","original_name":"Jeroen Goeijers","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/aKHPq2SRbsKtqzaNQ2e3889zKDV.jpg","credit_id":"5eb43edd0cb3350021c87363","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385782,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeroen Goeijers","original_name":"Jeroen Goeijers","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/aKHPq2SRbsKtqzaNQ2e3889zKDV.jpg","credit_id":"5eb43ee666469a001ce2afb1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11323662","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":756,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2jyad855F4gx4cxofDWJvrzx2y5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1344}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/adIeueUqNguIHDQpMx34xtOFadI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3fGdHxgTxA9AuGNRQequD4XNJpi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":194993,"name":"prison system"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"One World International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2020-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Prison for Profit official trailer","key":"373081381","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2019-11-14T09:17:04.000Z","id":"5eb43f22cc277c002066cd78"}]}}}
