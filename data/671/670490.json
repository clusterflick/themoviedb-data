Their mother is dead. One day, while dad's in town selling skins, Missy teases Kid and gets bitten. There's Hell to pay when dad gets home, and Kid runs off into the night to spend it with her animal friends. Little Man, who narrates much of the story as well as his reflections in a whisper, must sort out loss and emptiness.","popularity":0.5973,"poster_path":"/dkS3Ypwin2i78X9cp4ReLWcPxYV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128824,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Possum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2531978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Taylor","original_name":"Martin Taylor","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Little Man","credit_id":"5e3dd595e6d3cc00193df9e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Papps","original_name":"Stephen Papps","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/gPVthH8eQPprIR5NdU8uScdCEhk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dad","credit_id":"5e3dd5b041465c001ac87051","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2531981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eve-Marie Brandish","original_name":"Eve-Marie Brandish","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kid","credit_id":"5e3dd5c39603310015ea6478","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2531982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexia Verdonkschot","original_name":"Alexia Verdonkschot","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Missy","credit_id":"5e3dd5d80c2710001a7b295a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15574,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brad McGann","original_name":"Brad McGann","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3dd53fe04aca0016d5cb5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15585,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Trevor Haysom","original_name":"Trevor Haysom","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3dd5fb0c2710001a7b2972","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15290,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Leon Narbey","original_name":"Leon Narbey","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3dd641e04aca0013d5b03a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2532010,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Bailey","original_name":"Tom Bailey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3de0599603310017ea601a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15581,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Plummer","original_name":"Chris Plummer","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3de0a541465c0014c883bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359989,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Denise Kum","original_name":"Denise Kum","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3de10c41465c0018c874df","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15574,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brad McGann","original_name":"Brad McGann","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3de12398f1f1000f0eab08","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0134039","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":760,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dkS3Ypwin2i78X9cp4ReLWcPxYV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5774,"name":"forest"},{"id":10375,"name":"possessed"},{"id":190090,"name":"mysterious family"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
