He was subsequently sentenced to death on September 22, 1995. Panetti has an extensive history of mental illness, including schizophrenia, manic depression, auditory hallucinations and paranoia. Panetti was hospitalized, both voluntarily and involuntarily for mental illness fourteen times in six different hospitals before his arrest for capital murder in 1992. Following his conviction, Panettiâ€™s former wife, and daughter of the victims, Sonja Alvarado, filed a petition stating that Panetti never should have been tried for the crimes as he was suffering from paranoid delusions at the time of the killings.","popularity":0.6195,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":128789,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Texas Defender Service","origin_country":""},{"id":93896,"logo_path":null,"name":"Off Center Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Executing the Insane: The Case of Scott Panetti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":191570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Donahue","original_name":"Phil Donahue","popularity":0.2049,"profile_path":"/3e2hnEiPJzwYaQ0jaAajJIIx7by.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5e3c870f43250f0017c86dd9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1386749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Kunstler","original_name":"Sarah Kunstler","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/x0aMNeW9evO0CcN28Yd0zIk2HAZ.jpg","credit_id":"5e3c87cb0c271000137821c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1386748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Kunstler","original_name":"Emily Kunstler","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":"/nwacJkXc0vBbJejemT6iqJKIZAr.jpg","credit_id":"5e3c87edac8e6b0018cbcfe3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1386748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Kunstler","original_name":"Emily Kunstler","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":"/nwacJkXc0vBbJejemT6iqJKIZAr.jpg","credit_id":"5e3c880a982f74001344a119","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":60103,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martina Radwan","original_name":"Martina Radwan","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3c883bac8e6b0011cc5745","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2122,"name":"death penalty"},{"id":222,"name":"schizophrenia"},{"id":1556,"name":"texas"},{"id":2501,"name":"death row"},{"id":9826,"name":"murder"},{"id":13129,"name":"execution"},{"id":41329,"name":"mental illness"},{"id":241782,"name":"criminal justice system"},{"id":248541,"name":"american justice system"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
