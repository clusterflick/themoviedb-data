He had appeared on the local musical scene a few years earlier but was rediscovered and made popular by a generation of rock stars of the ‘60s and ‘70s. In 2014, two French cartoonists told Johnson’s story in their graphic novel Love in Vain. This documentary recounts their trip to Johnson’s home state, including interviews with a number of genuine bluesmen of the Deep South: R.L. Boyce, Watermelon Slim, Ben Payton, and Lucious Spiller among them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mississippi Ramblin': On the Tracks of Robert Johnson in the Deep South","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Mississippi Ramblin': Sur les traces de Robert Johnson dans le sud profond","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Finet","original_name":"Nicolas Finet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3b41ba66e4690019cadcfc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mississipi Ramblin' - Sur les traces de Robert Johnson dans le Sud profond","key":"305680342","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-12-11T08:19:12.000Z","id":"5e3b423498f1f100140a04c7"}]}}}
