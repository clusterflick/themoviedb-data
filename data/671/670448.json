A bruised man, a handsome poqué, but a survivor. With broad strokes of the brush, humor and friendships, he brings life to the windows of Montreal, embellishes the hearts of merchants and the souls of passers-by. Painter-poster artist – an endangered profession – Claude Dolbec chose the margins to better rediscover his fellow human beings and a sense of beauty. An inspiring love story, a story of extraordinary resilience.","popularity":0.0672,"poster_path":"/6LOwEZFfrgIgxk7HAJ6RdMrzVao.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130777,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films de l'Oeil","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Claude n'est pas mort","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2531861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Dolbec","original_name":"Claude Dolbec","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e3dae979603310017ea3632","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2531863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Charbonneau","original_name":"Linda Charbonneau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e3daebb43250f0015cb5e68","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368602,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alex Margineanu","original_name":"Alex Margineanu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3daf1c0c2710001379e6e7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368600,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vincent Guignard","original_name":"Vincent Guignard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3daf2c43250f0017ca2215","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Boulianne","original_name":"Bruno Boulianne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3daed7021cee00153eb085","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2570763,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brad Barr","original_name":"Brad Barr","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e72cf9e8e2e000012a75840","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2570761,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Jovani","original_name":"David Jovani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e72cf6d8e2e000012a75824","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2016485,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Drolet","original_name":"Catherine Drolet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e72cffa8e2e000012a7585f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2570762,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniela Mujica","original_name":"Daniela Mujica","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e72cf728e2e000012a7582d","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Boulianne","original_name":"Bruno Boulianne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e72cf878e2e000012a75830","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8199998","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Claudenestpasmort","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/6LOwEZFfrgIgxk7HAJ6RdMrzVao.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
