She encounters fearful, apathetic, and aggressive bacteria. The film plays on fears of foreign bodies invading us and our country. It is a child's fantasy of their mother's journey to a new unfamiliar land, made more uncanny and dreamlike with the use of classic special effects and a sci-fi experimental soundtrack.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rdjjAj1vS8bvpbEuawNJ3cQWQvS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother's Gut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2532137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matty Mancey","original_name":"Matty Mancey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3e1f3198f1f100120dda32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":847,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rdjjAj1vS8bvpbEuawNJ3cQWQvS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Final Girls Berlin","release_date":"2020-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
