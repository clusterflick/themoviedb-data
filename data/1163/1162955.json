But 25 years ago I rescued my first wolfdog and the journey began. In the past two decades WolfWood has grown beyond my wildest imagination. We have saved hundreds of animals and reached thousands of people with our educational outreach programs. This DVD is a result of those people requesting a look into my world.  When you watch \"Walking with Wolves,\" I hope you learn something. I hope you feel something and are able to come to a place of understanding about these amazing and resilient animals. They are my life's work, my joy and my passion. My journey continues.  This DVD is dedicated to all the volunteers that love the wolves and work hard to take care of them and me. WolfWood would not be a reality without them.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A tour of WolfWood","title":"Walking With Wolves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
