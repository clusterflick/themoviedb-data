In spring of 2016, UTAH & ETHER set out on a 5 week holiday to Australia, but before the end of the second week their travels took an unexpected turn. Utilizing the tête-bêche format, \"No comment.\" gives intimate accounts of their Australian trip gone awry. Half of the zine is from the perspective of ETHER and tells of his experiences within the Victoria Prison System. The other half of the zine gives details of UTAH's exploits, traveling and painting in Australia without her partner and while on the run from the police. The zine features personal stories from both the artists, as well as photos and evidence from the Magistrates Courts of Melbourne.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"No Comment","title":"UTAH & ETHER - \"No comment.\"","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
