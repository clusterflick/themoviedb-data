In the background is an old 1940's radio quietly broadcasting the world news. An accidental spilt cup of coffee on the desk coincides with a news broadcast of tsunami's in Australia, and then a knock of the table sets the whole room shaking whilst the radio reports of global seismic activity. The girls come to realise that every object on the curious table controls every event on the planet. A battle of good versus evil unfolds as one of girls, consumed by power, takes the world to the brink of Armageddon.","popularity":0.133,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Temps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1953910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jess-Luisa Flynn","original_name":"Jess-Luisa Flynn","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Astrid","credit_id":"64d36f12bf31f201ce66d76a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1245425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Lederer","original_name":"Hannah Lederer","popularity":0.109,"profile_path":"/5uKeWmdGe81MilARQLi4ro4Bxlo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"64d36f22db4ed600e2b4eec2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Furst","original_name":"Steve Furst","popularity":0.1186,"profile_path":"/13V6yjaswSUppCLak7aGdWNTsbY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Reporter","credit_id":"64d36f31dd926a01e627173e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4205519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Dowuona-Hyde","original_name":"Tom Dowuona-Hyde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d36ec7dd926a01ea9d1e5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4205519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Dowuona-Hyde","original_name":"Tom Dowuona-Hyde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d36ed2dd926a01e7325838","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4205521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alastair Q.
