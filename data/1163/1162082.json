It is home to one of the worldâ€™s founding civilizations, twenty-four indigenous languages, a wild and dramatic landscape, incredible biodiversity, a riotous menagerie of customs and traditions, and a gracious, resilient population.\r For decades, the country has struggled in anonymity, slowly emerging from the shadows of a devastating earthquake and tragic civil war.  Our film celebrates the things that makes Guatemala special while revealing the challenges that compel so many Guatemalans to risk the difficult journey to the southern border.\r Guatemala: On the Edge of Discovery provides a valuable window into a land and people worth getting to know, especially now.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guatemala: On the Edge of Discovery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
