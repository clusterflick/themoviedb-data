He lives near Perugia and at the age of 43 still dreams to become a sport champion, no matter the sport. He wants to join the golf team but his miniature golf skills aren’t so appreciated at the golf club. His dream is fading off but when he discovers that miniature golf is an actual sport his hope rise again. What he needs to have a real chance to become a champion in minigolf is the mathematical help of his brother Ferruccio. He was a maths professor in America and he just quitted his job and got back home after having a psychic breakdown. The brothers don’t see each other since their mother’s funeral 18 years ago. The renewed cohabitation isn’t simple but with Noelle’s help, the young african immigrant waitress at the local bar, the brothers get back to be a team as they were as children when they were able to face even the great Real Madrid.","popularity":0.1346,"poster_path":"/tKQNx2XkhxrwT6MWiimwWDCqabo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73086,"logo_path":null,"name":"ESP","origin_country":""},{"id":196037,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marvin Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":205822,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zootroupe Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ferretti Brothers vs Real Madrid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3405078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodolfo Mantovani","original_name":"Rodolfo Mantovani","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Achille Ferretti","credit_id":"64d35916037264011c055cd5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4205421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniele Ridolfi","original_name":"Daniele Ridolfi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Ferruccio Ferretti","credit_id":"64d35920b6c2641155eef81f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2683883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashai Lombardo Arop","original_name":"Ashai Lombardo Arop","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Noelle","credit_id":"64d3592cd100b6011c7f4fbb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mauro Cardinali","original_name":"Mauro Cardinali","popularity":0.107,"profile_path":"/pKDEVLelckIHzKZbr3COo1B3l7z.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Svonimir Krimic","credit_id":"64d35938dd926a01e98787b2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4205423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberta Rossi","original_name":"Roberta Rossi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Roberta","credit_id":"64d35949bf31f201ca8a0778","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Rossini","original_name":"Francesco Rossini","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Presidente Sporting Club","credit_id":"64d35957037264013915565f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2186724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giulia Zeetti","original_name":"Giulia Zeetti","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Nadia","credit_id":"64d35961d100b601395b0cce","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4205424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone Marcelli","original_name":"Simone Marcelli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Sig.
