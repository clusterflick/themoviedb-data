Today approximately 90% of that land is no longer in Black hands. Various factors have been employed to take Black land, including violence, eminent domain and government discrimination. But it is a little-known issue — heirs’ property — that has had a devastating effect on Black land ownership. Gaining Ground: The Fight for Black Land is a timely and stirring documentary from Emmy-nominated producer/director Eternal Polk and Al Roker Entertainment that examines the causes, effects what is being done to fight the exploitation of these issues, and how landowners are reclaiming their agricultural legacy and creating paths to generational wealth.","popularity":0.5786,"poster_path":"/pXRlBqWv5nobaR6fb24D0J84nQC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gaining Ground: The Fight for Black Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4214427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Baszile","original_name":"Natalie Baszile","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"(self)","credit_id":"64da264737109700e226c427","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4214428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrez Carberry","original_name":"Andrez Carberry","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"(self)","credit_id":"64da2651001bbd01005db0e6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4214429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dãnia Davy","original_name":"Dãnia Davy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"(self)","credit_id":"64da265bbf31f201cb6b9923","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4214430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johane Domersant","original_name":"Johane Domersant","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"(self)","credit_id":"64da2663b77d4b11425d465a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4214432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debra Ely","original_name":"Debra Ely","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"(self)","credit_id":"64da266cbf31f201ce6a0bb4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4214433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip 'P.J.'
