Chronos is the Titian – the time god who rules the universe – the flux in which events are born, mature and decay. The work explores video as a creative form of memory, it moves outwards from the particular and personal images of a diary – the fragmentary and inconsistent building blocks of memory – towards their transformation into more fundamental symbols in the cycles of days, seasons, birth and death. This transforming symbolic memory is all placed in the context of the social and political events of the world – particularly China and the Balkans – as they are encountered in the personal space.","popularity":0.0593,"poster_path":"/flRRxtQKbs667h8bc6GxHtiYO2N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chronos Fragmented","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malcolm Le Grice","original_name":"Malcolm Le Grice","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/dXry25TyoLUpViu8Paqf6RMkDv7.jpg","credit_id":"64d18299945d3601394eac77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/flRRxtQKbs667h8bc6GxHtiYO2N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
