The mine owner’s friend Hard was in prison for theft, and his daughter Erna was therefore in Werner’s care. Hard escaped from prison and found Werner on his deathbed. With the best of intentions, he soothed his old friend’s pain with opium, but unfortunately too generously. Now everyone suspects Erna except Werner’s son Alf, who must prove her innocence.
