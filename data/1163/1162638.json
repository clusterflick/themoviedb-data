Shot entirely on a 100 year old wooden hand-cranked 35mm camera, LONDONERS documents modern day London as never seen before. It shows the city as a community: a piece of contemporary history about what its like to live in London today. In an era obsessed with digital technology, by an increasingly camera-sceptic public, LONDONERS features thousands of people interacting directly with the camera, as was always the case in times gone by.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Londoners","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1806469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Ernst","original_name":"Joseph Ernst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d37aa003726401391565bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2318589","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
