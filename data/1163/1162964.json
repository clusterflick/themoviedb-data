In the 2012 installation version at the Buffalo AKG, the slides were transferred to digital projection and Conrad’s live accompaniment was replaced by a contemporaneous recording of him playing piano. The piano accompaniment belongs to a larger durational performance project that Conrad called Music and the Mind of the World. Between 1976 and 1982, the artist—who was known as a violinist and had no formal piano training—recorded himself experimenting at length on the piano. The photographs that make up Tiding over till Tomorrow were taken by Conrad and are joined by a number of enigmatic texts slides by the artist Anne Turyn.","popularity":0.0631,"poster_path":"/pj0cegQNskSFuAtMKhaIbbqVGHg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tiding over till Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2760002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Conrad","original_name":"Dan Conrad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64d44cd4b6c264115751d4aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4206951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malou Conrad","original_name":"Malou Conrad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64d44cf1dd926a01e987eef7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4206952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Conrad","original_name":"Ted Conrad","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64d44d0adb4ed6011c4aae47","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Conrad","original_name":"Tony Conrad","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/5m5qwalSYvfG2i26w88UTwMFztK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64d44d11d100b600e267d9fa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4206953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leora Eiferman","original_name":"Leora Eiferman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64d44d1eb6c26411569a0ac7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3709365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Henderson","original_name":"Richard Henderson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"64d44d58021cee013b722362","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4206954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Kazinski","original_name":"Karen Kazinski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"64d44d65b6c2641158c5b0aa","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4206955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fran Keeman","original_name":"Fran Keeman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"64d44d75d100b600ff08f82c","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4206949,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anne Turyn","original_name":"Anne Turyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d44c2c021cee011c8f4fe7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Conrad","original_name":"Tony Conrad","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/5m5qwalSYvfG2i26w88UTwMFztK.jpg","credit_id":"64d44bdfdd926a01eb192845","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Conrad","original_name":"Tony Conrad","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/5m5qwalSYvfG2i26w88UTwMFztK.jpg","credit_id":"64d44c1c021cee00ae510ed0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Conrad","original_name":"Tony Conrad","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/5m5qwalSYvfG2i26w88UTwMFztK.jpg","credit_id":"64d44bedbf31f201cd4da945","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pj0cegQNskSFuAtMKhaIbbqVGHg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Buffalo AKG","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Kitchen","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
