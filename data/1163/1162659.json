The fainted image of his family and the last moments of his carefree childhood, resurface in his mind. The friends he had to abandon too soon; his grandfather who tirelessly recounted stories of the sea; an unfulfilled father; and a mother descending into the spiral of depression. During Peppeâ€™s journey coming home, years unravel over the miles that he put between himself and home. Years of absence echo in the dull sound of the wind breaking against the rocks. Peppe goes back home to retrieve, from the seabed, the breath of life (sciatu meo) that sustains his vitality, as well as his memory of an eternal love.","popularity":0.1029,"poster_path":"/src40DXGVN1YKrx09gz0hMdZ9K9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205839,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fondazione Alta Mane
