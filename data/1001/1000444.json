Directly or indirectly, each of them will experiment with the delights and torments of romance–desire and rejection, idealized and consummated love... Nina and Eulalie are sisters who share a strong bond. Eulalie, the eldest, is waiting for the return of her fiancé, who has left to seek his fortune in the Americas, while Nina seems to have nothing to wait for. Through nine chapters, we follow the destiny of each of these young women as they are finally confronted with the reality of a world and an era in which being a woman means not being free. Nina and Eulalie weave their way through each of these stories as they endeavor to understand and perhaps escape the inevitability of their fate as women.","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":"/uG9HlhyH7yxEH27EqJcgFtC6BRq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films
