In the early 1900s death was all too common in the oil boom town of Fairfax on the Osage reservation. Osage people were dying at alarming rates. Local authorities were quick to attribute these deaths to “accident,” “suicide” or “poison whiskey.” But when the Smith home was blown up in Fairfax it became apparent to everyone that someone was murdering the Osage people.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":178842,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":73959,"logo_path":"/o4LDcUD1XPiPv32cCgeoBCz3d0G.png","name":"Vision Maker Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Osage Murders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Ray Whitman","original_name":"Richard Ray Whitman","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/vo65fKd6ABcY2wtwl489r05kRG0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6534ccbc2b210800e23c8e73","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3625479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Bigbee, Jr.","original_name":"Dan Bigbee, Jr.","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d1e50caf4324005151276a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3625485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lily Shangreaux","original_name":"Lily Shangreaux","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d1e5300bb0760050eef0ff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3625479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Bigbee, Jr.","original_name":"Dan Bigbee, Jr.","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6534ccf3c14fee00e35eda29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3625485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lily Shangreaux","original_name":"Lily Shangreaux","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6534cd0691f0ea00c422aa40","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27521849","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Youtube","release_date":"2022-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Osage Murders | 2022 PBS Short Film Festival","key":"C5OiFBNlYkY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2022-07-11T13:00:10.000Z","id":"6534cc868cfcc7012b3fd25e"}]}}}
