Exploring the complexities of family, society and culture that shape young Filipinos, this feature debut from rising filmmaker Caleb Ribates depicts the tender relationship between an immigrant father and his young son as they deal with being abandoned by the boy’s mother. With its evocative black-and-white cinematography, long takes and naturalistic dialogue, Anak follows in the footsteps of slow-cinema masters like Lav Diaz and Apichatpong Weerasethakul, while finding an intimacy and tonal register that is all Ribates’ own.","popularity":0.236,"poster_path":"/9ScKFzYQDox94cUd5WUwDw860rD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3626104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Lawang","original_name":"Anthony Lawang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62d2a7e4158c85029e9ad676","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2763975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Ramos","original_name":"Gabriel Ramos","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62d2a7ffc15b55004d3ff3e5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3626107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caleb Ribates","original_name":"Caleb Ribates","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ea032606f984014e68c53a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3626107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caleb Ribates","original_name":"Caleb Ribates","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ea03135258ae010bd9d3a3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3626107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caleb Ribates","original_name":"Caleb Ribates","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ea02f706f98400eb6029a7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1715291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Victor Pastor","original_name":"Matthew Victor Pastor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d2a83c158c85029e9ad6b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3050223,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tavis Pinnington","original_name":"Tavis Pinnington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d2a87e2d1e4000560bc6f9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3626107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caleb Ribates","original_name":"Caleb Ribates","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d2a815eec5b5032c6e85e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3626109,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Timna Katz","original_name":"Timna Katz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d2a858eec5b5032a877dd1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3210354,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claire Giuffre","original_name":"Claire Giuffre","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d2a8a453f8330401f4cc8a","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3626117,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Liam Harrington","original_name":"Liam Harrington","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d2a8c053f83304009f3aa3","department":"Production","job":"Production Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9ScKFzYQDox94cUd5WUwDw860rD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/olUiPAXCIQyTpVEOAxYOlqSzABE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15160,"name":"divorce"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":194226,"name":"masculinity"},{"id":292293,"name":"asian masculinity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Anak | Trailer","key":"tVMM4LBJRC8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-07-12T09:25:55.000Z","id":"62d28401378062004e00eab4"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Anak Trailer","key":"612281461","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-09-23T03:36:57.000Z","id":"62d28451c15b550055f16aab"}]}}}
