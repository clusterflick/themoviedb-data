The song, written by Nashville songwriter Lee Domann, tells the story of Lee’s classmate, Howard Ray, who was a social outcast and ridiculed by his peers. In his song, Lee looks back with regret at an incident in which he didn’t attempt to help Howard as he was being physically harassed by others. The film tracks Lee’s life through the emotional memories of his childhood to the writing of the song, and his reunion with Howard thirty years later. Finding Howard is a call to action for the creation of caring and compassionate learning communities where children feel safe, understood and heard.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/qfU9j6BeRa1JAsGlERAiodxCAn3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
