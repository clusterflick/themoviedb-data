The camera takes in objects, plants, a landscape, bodies, a stretch of water, the air, wind. The scenes are short, often framed as close-ups. This unfurling of furtive moments, enigmatic spaces and blazing light plays out like a series of disorientations, sustained by a soundtrack that is every bit as rich and sensual.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/m2jZdfk9zl7L1Im189AXos9hz1J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"death by fantasies by mirrors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1658498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Clermont","original_name":"Charlotte Clermont","popularity":0.0799,"profile_path":"/ApndoVBBtFqQQY8So2u9NPqHPwr.jpg","credit_id":"62d32b6dd399e6004bfb94f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m2jZdfk9zl7L1Im189AXos9hz1J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
