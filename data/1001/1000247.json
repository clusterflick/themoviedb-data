From a tiny warbler announcing the awakening dawn, to sibling brown bears growling over fishing rights, to the roar of a calving glacier, the earth offers a rich and varied chorus for those who listen. Set in Glacier Bay National Park, one of the most spectacular wild places on earth, The Singing Planet immerses viewers in these wild voices and the wild places that give rise to them, guided by natural sounds recordists, Richard Nelson and Hank Lentfer.","popularity":0.0892,"poster_path":"/mTeDoFzP3ahCtzlNgM8jLTk1EL1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Singing Planet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard A.
