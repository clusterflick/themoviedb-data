An apolitical film about a political event. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1988, Armenia has entered a new era of democracy after the independence movement  and the victory of the Karabakh war. There was a  terrorist attack on parliament in 1998. In 2008, there was a nationwide movement, which ended with the murder of ten people. In 2018, people finally stood up again. There was a decisive novelty. Everyone who had a smartphone was a cameraman. The film is based entirely on authentic footage shot by these willing cameramen.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":85687,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Cinema Centre of Armenia","origin_country":"AM"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revolivetion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3625051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"ARA TCHAGHARYAN","original_name":"ARA TCHAGHARYAN","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d18b7f549dda02d6759f73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hy","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
