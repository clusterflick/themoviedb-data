It's a story that begins right in the middle of Brazil: in the hinterland of Minas Gerais.  A boy loses his revered mother and ends up forgetting his own name, because his stepfather, now the only member of the family, only calls him “kid”.  But everything changes when he makes a friend, nothing ordinary, a fish, and starts to see his whole story with different eyes.  Now he has a mission: to take his friend to see the sea.","popularity":0.3822,"poster_path":"/yigMS535GntEfsxx9iECgbjOMPq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2022-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cargas D'Água","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Out of Water","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3630588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vitor Rocha","original_name":"Vitor Rocha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Charles / Padrasto / Gonçalo","credit_id":"62d778cccaa508004fffe874","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Paula Villar","original_name":"Ana Paula Villar","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Pepita / Dona Rosaura / Abigail/ Mãe","credit_id":"62d77a5babf8e2004dfc80f3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2431593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Torquato","original_name":"André Torquato","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Moleque","credit_id":"62d77a958a0e9b005986deac","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3630588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vitor Rocha","original_name":"Vitor Rocha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b6d72228667ac23ba5658","department":"Sound","job":"Songs"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827364,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Fran Barros","original_name":"Fran Barros","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b6f3942ba7a8aa2813200","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3630588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vitor Rocha","original_name":"Vitor Rocha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b6d20af34a9411ae5d2a3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4817417,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hector de Paula","original_name":"Hector de Paula","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b6ebd3eb5984302eae61c","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4817418,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hector de Paula","original_name":"Hector de Paula","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b6ede14784127bb23c645","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Paula Villar","original_name":"Ana Paula Villar","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b6d4a3eb5984302eae5cf","department":"Sound","job":"Songs"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4817431,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paulo Altafim","original_name":"Paulo Altafim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b6fc042ba7a8aa2813229","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4817429,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marina Gatti","original_name":"Marina Gatti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b6f8e2b5de72360eae4cc","department":"Crew","job":"Lighting Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4634273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Ariante","original_name":"Victoria Ariante","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b6df3e101378cfa23c7b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4817435,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rhaissa Bertalia","original_name":"Rhaissa Bertalia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b7015f8e8312aef009c58","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yigMS535GntEfsxx9iECgbjOMPq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":682}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4344,"name":"musical"},{"id":220201,"name":"musical theater"},{"id":264118,"name":"brazil"},{"id":271672,"name":"water"},{"id":283599,"name":"água"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
