The lives of Fiacre, Fidéline and Olivier ended in 1994, and the last days of these children are linked to three events: the memory of the genocide, the Gacaca trials of 2005 and the resilience of the village where those who were devastated and those who loved them live a life together again. The film tries to approach the truth, to restore its existence and to preserve the history of a hill for all hills.","popularity":0.1589,"poster_path":"/4eJA8HYXIyne9jWkmhVQDeo7S4o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12406,"logo_path":"/e89tcj2PpfFffwA0etxuGftj0YU.png","name":"La Compagnie Cinématographique","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":55248,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tchin Tchin Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":12407,"logo_path":"/g11ZDtSicimXi5MmwUznAsEomXZ.png","name":"Panache Productions","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One of the Thousand Hills","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Bellefroid","original_name":"Bernard Bellefroid","popularity":0.0489,"profile_path":"/p9x4NrYS6N6RRE87bByJafYwvkO.jpg","credit_id":"62d2c8106eecee067e4a6477","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Bellefroid","original_name":"Bernard Bellefroid","popularity":0.0489,"profile_path":"/p9x4NrYS6N6RRE87bByJafYwvkO.jpg","credit_id":"62d2c8166eecee067d94f2dd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935694,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gaëtan David","original_name":"Gaëtan David","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":"/gwMHoTEHqRK1P2JOuyptex48qPt.jpg","credit_id":"6549037c532acb00e1499ef5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29606289","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4eJA8HYXIyne9jWkmhVQDeo7S4o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1067}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Festival International du Film Francophone de Namur","release_date":"2023-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
