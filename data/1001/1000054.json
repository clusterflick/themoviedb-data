Takashi Nishihara, a filmmaker who has been following the youth protests in Japan notices that there is one party that seems to be raising issues of gender and economic in the political sphere, the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), a party about to enter its hundredth year and consistently burdened by its historical connotations. Though an outsider of the party, Nishihara gained unprecedented access to the JCP and driven by his interest in the younger party members who find hope in the JCP, the resulting documentary goes beyond party politics and observes the current grassroots leftist movements in Japan. It also becomes witness to the larger and deep-seated patriarchal system that continues to quell momentums of hope.","popularity":0.0758,"poster_path":"/7GDGWToG56jAbP0IOSDzQdv5w5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Hundred Years and Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"100 Years and Hope","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Nishihara","original_name":"西原孝至","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d16581af4324005150e576","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2732338,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aiko Masubuchi","original_name":"Aiko Masubuchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6683f2e43aa407dbdb043018","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22174706","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/7GDGWToG56jAbP0IOSDzQdv5w5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1368,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/3UgB7RF7rxPe82MBtKvOvJa3kKO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":968}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2022-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
