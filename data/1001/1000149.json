She spent her adult life trying to explain evil. She did it through an intense process of research, resulting in biographies of Franz Stangl, commander of the Treblinka death camp, of Hitlerâ€™s architect and close companion Albert Speer, and of Mary Bell, a child murderer. Sereny, in the film, raises this question: are we all able, one day, to switch to the other side?","popularity":0.0704,"poster_path":"/kWk7nRDsXJKv2Cn1POtshVr4SlB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6941,"logo_path":"/mjl7Tn8vszEPdWIfIg3c6weyjPP.png","name":"Gloria Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":68446,"logo_path":"/9GiI34u4iJu9gOYD28RRLgm51vf.png","name":"Katuh Studio","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"After The Evil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Erde","original_name":"Tamara Erde","popularity":0.0756,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d197c4bd588b005e2460d1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Erde","original_name":"Tamara Erde","popularity":0.0756,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d197bd549dda02d675a31c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kWk7nRDsXJKv2Cn1POtshVr4SlB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
