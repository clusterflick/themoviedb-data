As his life begins to fall into a repetitive hell, he finds himself listening to voices of his past and future. As he spirals into a sense of confusion, he is met with the haunting appearance of a darkness known only as The Void and the death that awaits him in the darkness of his very soul. Inspired by films of the past and German Expressionism, Call of the Void is a deep look at the horrors of the darkness within and the loneliness we face in the absence of our inner light.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/j0r3Do7TKJAVAtV79DezesVR2WB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anatomica Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call of the Void","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1668606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jared Bankens","original_name":"Jared Bankens","popularity":1.1612,"profile_path":"/6Wr4uihYoP6H7MBXY3EsAjOPthR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Painter","credit_id":"681a3ab3b80ab9b76e444002","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2598304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirsten Bazet","original_name":"Kirsten Bazet","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Scryer","credit_id":"681a3ac8eca6b930cd934947","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1953024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.M.
