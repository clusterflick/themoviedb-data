This story explores the development of their theater piece Bordertown, commissioned by the San Diego Repertory Theatre. Utilizing behind the scenes footage and interviews with Montoya, Siguenza, and Salinas, we examine how they shape Bordertown and offer their own interpretation of the region. They interviewed more than 100 people in San Diego and Tijuana and developed multiple characters whose lives are represented on the stage.  Some of these characters are unusual choices, like Shamu, Sea World’s killer whale and a married couple representing the U.S. and Mexico.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":261454,"logo_path":"/7mMV8CP034hQ0Wu1I1q6xWU6XwB.png","name":"Espinosa Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Culture Clash","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2126340,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Espinosa","original_name":"Paul Espinosa","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/eyWrEgsKbcvmkjRykmW36GbP7jl.jpg","credit_id":"681a9a2ae551b890e4df9011","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2126340,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Espinosa","original_name":"Paul Espinosa","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/eyWrEgsKbcvmkjRykmW36GbP7jl.jpg","credit_id":"681a9a3a1cbf5ce2d0df9018","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2126340,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Espinosa","original_name":"Paul Espinosa","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/eyWrEgsKbcvmkjRykmW36GbP7jl.jpg","credit_id":"681a9a45291755b394ab0750","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5418964,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Bovee","original_name":"Michael Bovee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681a9a549c41ec65dfdf8fee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5421701,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Dean","original_name":"Michael Dean","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681a9a7fbdd59d6d1f85078d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5421703,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victor Payan","original_name":"Victor Payan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681a9a8e09106ef181ef0af9","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Culture Clash\" (3 mins)","key":"792773534","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-01-25T21:52:29.000Z","id":"681a99f39e4238c31ddf907b"}]}}}
