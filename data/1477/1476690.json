Here, sharing the same valleys, are homeowners concerned about property values and sanitation, and migrant workers, living in conditions which most Americans expect only in the Third World. This program chronicles the life and death of the Green Valley camp, home to thousands of workers over the last ten years, many of them legalized under the 1986 immigration bill.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uneasy Neighbors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2126340,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Espinosa","original_name":"Paul Espinosa","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/eyWrEgsKbcvmkjRykmW36GbP7jl.jpg","credit_id":"681a65e318d6fa3edce1a542","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2126340,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Espinosa","original_name":"Paul Espinosa","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/eyWrEgsKbcvmkjRykmW36GbP7jl.jpg","credit_id":"681a65edf8e5cf9b0de1a4e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2126340,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Espinosa","original_name":"Paul Espinosa","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/eyWrEgsKbcvmkjRykmW36GbP7jl.jpg","credit_id":"681a65fa536f962ca72a7cf7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5421167,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mark Zimmerman","original_name":"Mark Zimmerman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681a660e4d1f9314892a7d12","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
