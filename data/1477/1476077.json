The mechanisms that set the conditions for a stroke are explained with emphasis on hardening of the arteries and blood clots. If a stroke occurs it will affect certain functions controlled by the brain. The functions (speech, memory, muscular control) affected will depend upon the location of the stroke in the brain. Once a stroke has occurred rehabilitation through physical therapy can help. Basic lifestyle changes, which may be required if there is a family history of stroke, include having regular medical checkups, exercising. learning to relax, eating balanced meals (lower in fat and cholesterol), and stopping smoking.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20859,"logo_path":null,"name":"Churchill Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strokes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1042186,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert B.
