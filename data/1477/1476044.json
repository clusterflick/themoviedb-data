Originally mixed under tight deadlines, the band revisited the album 15 years later with a fresh perspective—remixing, re-recording, and in some cases reinterpreting the material to match their original vision. The result is a richer, more dynamic listening experience that highlights the emotional depth and sonic detail of the songs. This 5.1 edition is a must-have for audiophiles and fans of immersive progressive rock.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/fFLu15JJh4sqDmxBh9WIjOI4gSY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marillion - Radiation 2013 5.1","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Hogarth","original_name":"Steve Hogarth","popularity":0.4309,"profile_path":"/8vMI6IXqbdvnxWMIEb74q6OjagI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vocals, additional piano and percussion","credit_id":"6818eaae59fc8a4b57031af6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Rothery","original_name":"Steve Rothery","popularity":0.4182,"profile_path":"/z8TfSYWL5TF74ZLtwl9GLs9h73f.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Guitars","credit_id":"6818eabdddc43923a9487946","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Kelly","original_name":"Mark Kelly","popularity":0.245,"profile_path":"/cChF8m5l3tOQBamZTWSazhOdxzc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Keyboards and backing vocals","credit_id":"6818eb09ae3fd4edaf84d4c9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Trewavas","original_name":"Pete Trewavas","popularity":0.4199,"profile_path":"/pzdOR7KsFhdppfi5X8gKhnIoGmD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bass, acoustic guitar and backing vocals","credit_id":"6818eb26919adbca6a6400fa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Mosley","original_name":"Ian Mosley","popularity":0.3735,"profile_path":"/63ZIZVwgibgIyLJlQSemiiNPrbg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Drums and percussion","credit_id":"6818eb369785293332461ed0","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fFLu15JJh4sqDmxBh9WIjOI4gSY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":157954,"name":"progressive rock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
