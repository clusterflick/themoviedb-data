It reflects our emerging neural mediascape and it's adversarial hallucinations as a sublime 'hostile architecture'.  The cast of The Bastard Fields includes an embittered bog body discussing exit strategies with a homemade robot, two creative directors cooking up some dank reality-settings among a DIY Splinternet, a mystic rabbit vlogging on the nature of rabbit holes, an outlaw preacher tending his field conventicle, and poor little Brownie is martyred. This is the clamour and humiliation of content at the end of the world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bastard Fields","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4546572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dane Sutherland","original_name":"Dane Sutherland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6818e98f65415eade16400fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
