With a keen curatorial eye for finding treasure in household trash, Nelson has created a collection of found objects in a sanitation garage in East Harlem, which he refers to as a museum of \"Treasures in the Trash.\" This collection is a reflection of the community he has been serving and is perfect for a festival based in Harlem! As the film follows Nelson on his route and through his collection, he encourages us to see the things that we encounter in daily life anew.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Man's Trash","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5421119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Adams","original_name":"Kelly Adams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681a5fd2b2716918f1fb0d16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5421119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Adams","original_name":"Kelly Adams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681a5ffd97452926dde1a4ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4806518","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2016-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"One Mans Trash Trailer","key":"-DR2fhHMo7g","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-03-09T21:37:02.000Z","id":"681a5eeb0e74786390cfd47d"}]}}}
