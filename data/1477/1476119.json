Jazz, who is on a journey to\r define oneself and Pop who is returning home to the big city by the sea. In this oasis at\r the end of the world, they will meet a series of characters, all haunted by a symphony of\r indeterminable desires and by the irresistible dream of a life without limits. Each of them\r will open up to Jazz, philosophize thru the night, and share their most intimate fears and\r reflections on a world whose meaning constantly slips through their fingers. Through its\r poetry ― both naïve and lucid ― Please Thrill Me gives a glimpse of a universe in which\r ephemeral yet inevitable friendships arise. Life has a way of detracting our plans, of\r making them sway with its moods, but let us not give up until the very end. The true\r meaning sometimes only shows up after the last call.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Please Thrill Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
