He theorises that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds, and seeks to convince himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed in order to remove obstacles to the higher goals of \"extraordinary\" men. Once the deed is done, however, he finds himself wracked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. His theoretical justifications lose all their power as he struggles with guilt and horror and is confronted with both internal and external consequences of his deed.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/c44pcSTFYKlONyVbASWLc77jcw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246590,"logo_path":null,"name":"גשר","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":200,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Passions and Torments in Cabaret Style","title":"Crime and Punishment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1846858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avi Azulay","original_name":"Avi Azulay","popularity":0.3334,"profile_path":"/mxGTMMlG3INAmSk7YoXfM5MAIMv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Raskolnikov","credit_id":"681a5e940b9f782e01749615","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2445259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilad Kletter","original_name":"Gilad Kletter","popularity":0.4658,"profile_path":"/9V0zNGcuEAB3ib7RxZsDep24JiH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Porfíry Petrovich","credit_id":"681a5ebab940a3393d21d7a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neta Roth","original_name":"Neta Roth","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":"/yPETHDFXK5bT6lx5o8clK45GDv1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sonya","credit_id":"681a5ed2f288a865ee7495eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anatoliy Belyy","original_name":"Анатолий Белый","popularity":0.8648,"profile_path":"/cQupz7e1lPQyAIfFlncdgYQUzXH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marmeladov","credit_id":"681a5fc3009c876b2dfc11b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1260161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natasha Manor","original_name":"Natasha Manor","popularity":0.0268,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Katerina Ivanovna","credit_id":"681a60a43bf92f165321d72a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1536565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svetlana Demidov","original_name":"Svetlana Demidov","popularity":0.0953,"profile_path":"/8In0HEP9UpHZuxczb9XrqzusdST.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Raskolnikov's mother","credit_id":"681a61390518cf15e8e4ac99","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3485111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena Fraifeld","original_name":"Lena Fraifeld","popularity":0.1302,"profile_path":"/eHw80AFIPHIyaAGfNGXr5HDthRh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Raskolnikov's sister","credit_id":"681a61dac3494c7580fb0d22","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1555662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandr Molochnikov","original_name":"Александр Молочников","popularity":0.3358,"profile_path":"/2kgHWDgJ5jGlajV00vU0cYe6Kp9.jpg","credit_id":"681a621529ddee8597fc11ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223230,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","original_name":"Фёдор Достоевский","popularity":1.598,"profile_path":"/hMm3y5n60KNvLB5F14oCfo8imSK.jpg","credit_id":"681a624a1eba3a4421e1a4e3","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1555662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandr Molochnikov","original_name":"Александр Молочников","popularity":0.3358,"profile_path":"/2kgHWDgJ5jGlajV00vU0cYe6Kp9.jpg","credit_id":"681a62625eaa664c5fe4ac49","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5118726,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"רועי חן","original_name":"רועי חן","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681a627d2da5d0c2b6cfd47d","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/93bgOWDbcXC7aNTSwHZfb311XAm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lL6K302PIAlGUWEZE12sjgK1t3O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tG15ttOzO5uffLrjNnfYWb4b7Ev.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/er5fuQTtXXIglhYqApbGpQYjx3b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":933,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c44pcSTFYKlONyVbASWLc77jcw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":622},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":927,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/11tiTXX5p4j5MW8nfOjX84UlCs3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":618}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
