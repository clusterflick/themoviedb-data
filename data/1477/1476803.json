On the brink of homelessness, Sparrow is offered shelter in the flat next door to the parlour, as the boundary between life and death – and work and self – dissolves into oblivion. Bleakly funny and formally playful.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2025-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Death of an Undertaker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Byers","original_name":"Christian Byers","popularity":0.7081,"profile_path":"/yfAKKbzeEsH5Q981mQjaydO8tE6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"681a9628a51467fa46c6975f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5421678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Salamone","original_name":"Michele Salamone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"681a97d41b8f90cda15af13f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5421679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosa Peronace","original_name":"Rosa Peronace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"681a97ecf9a6091f7ec6976a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Byers","original_name":"Christian Byers","popularity":0.7081,"profile_path":"/yfAKKbzeEsH5Q981mQjaydO8tE6.jpg","credit_id":"681a9612a51467fa46c69755","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5421660,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"PJ Mitton","original_name":"PJ Mitton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681a965eb25c97ba6fdf90ae","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Byers","original_name":"Christian Byers","popularity":0.7081,"profile_path":"/yfAKKbzeEsH5Q981mQjaydO8tE6.jpg","credit_id":"681a9674b25c97ba6fdf90b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sydney Film Festival","release_date":"2025-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
