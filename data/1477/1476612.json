Inside is her 20th birthday gift, prepared in advance by her father before his passing. The birthday gift contains a riddle hinting at the origin of her name, 'Prim,' which she must solve before she can open the present. Eventually, Prim solves the riddle and learns the real name her father had chosen for her. When she finally opens the gift, it turns out that the present her father intended for her was actually meant for his son.\"","popularity":0.2,"poster_path":"/3DegtSVM5GwjTcd3d0cy4xYtYDZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2025-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"However
