The eight-member orchestra, led by music director Alan Williams, delivers lush instrumentals throughout. Scherzinger and Francis' duet of \"The Perfect Year\" is reenvisioned as a soft rocker with R&B vibes. \"Sunset Boulevard\" rocks, which perfectly suits Francis' voice; here, he stands still, rather than his usual stroll through New York City streets. In both arrangements, Justin Rothberg's electric guitar shines. To bookend this performance, Scherzinger's expansive voice commands the stage in \"With One Look\" and in a blistering rendition of \"As If We Never Said Goodbye.\"","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/tdflESVVOOXrfhjp3DlBwxg97Vx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"As if we never said goodbye","title":"Sunset Boulevard: Tiny Desk Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":151246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Scherzinger","original_name":"Nicole Scherzinger","popularity":2.875,"profile_path":"/kKG7zJvVReTipBYDD3aqHj4uPBe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68190450976c1e606c9138ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2882960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Francis","original_name":"Tom Francis","popularity":0.3562,"profile_path":"/Xm6outPbQZuYqNOqB6DubdXpVD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6819045f73d47302a6461cf4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398427,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Maia Stern","original_name":"Maia Stern","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6819048e001cddc700031f2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1290,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jEOtIDV8rvkM8cb2viTznzHgtnF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2293}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tdflESVVOOXrfhjp3DlBwxg97Vx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1944}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
