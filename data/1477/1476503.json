Built around an original poem, the film follows no traditional narrative, instead weaving together fragments of light, emotion, and thought to reflect the process of self-discovery. Through raw visuals and mixed media elements it captures a moment of becoming, a state of searching without resolution. Rather than offering answers, it invites viewers into the quiet, unfinished space of personal truth.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1wPMY69w7OkNhLBQ2fSjJj3Mizy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2025-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fragments of identity, woven together.","title":"Self-Portrait: Fragments of Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5420277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Maria Bărbat","original_name":"Sara Maria Bărbat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"681a16ba68d93c220e64059d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5420277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Maria Bărbat","original_name":"Sara Maria Bărbat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681a172f2b0dc6286a4ff129","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5420277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Maria Bărbat","original_name":"Sara Maria Bărbat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681a1749651ece2087c37a98","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5420277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Maria Bărbat","original_name":"Sara Maria Bărbat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681a1769c7019a8ba474b6ae","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5420277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Maria Bărbat","original_name":"Sara Maria Bărbat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681a17a0c2495c9beec634ba","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"@_saras.lens_","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ro","file_path":"/1wPMY69w7OkNhLBQ2fSjJj3Mizy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10683,"name":"coming of age"},{"id":208873,"name":"acceptance"},{"id":257258,"name":"quest for identity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ro","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
