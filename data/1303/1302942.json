Intimate interviews and gripping imagery reveal stories of sacrifice, courage and the emotional toll endured by photographers and their subjects. Stories include New York Times photographer Joao Silva revisiting sites in his native South Africa, recalling the violence that led to that country's first democratic elections in 1994. Ashley Gilbertson travels to Midland, Texas, for the final shoot of his project documenting the bedrooms of young soldiers who never returned home from war. Other photographers shares their firsthand experiences covering conflict in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan and the Middle East.","popularity":0.2207,"poster_path":"/kAeEFK057QgfdihYx9vfdZL6xeO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arclight Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Award-winning photojournalists recount personal experiences from war zones.","title":"The War Photographers","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2869833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Avakian","original_name":"Alexandra Avakian","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/yVtsFA43HW5QWSCHYVMHwWiz3n3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"666743db82178510b5a9b9f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4767694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolyn Cole","original_name":"Carolyn Cole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"6667445710e2dc07a21c2a36","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3150449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Gilbertson","original_name":"Ashley Gilbertson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"666744e6914b88907ae9da78","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":122283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edouard H.R.
