It was while at Watford that Barnes launched his international career and would go on to be capped 79 times for a country that he was not initially eligible to represent. At Liverpool, John would establish himself as one the greatest player in the club's history, winning the league championship and the Football Writers' Player of Year award in two of his first three seasons at the club.
