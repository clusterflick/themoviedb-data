Indebted to the spirits of Larry Cohen, Anne Charlotte Robertson, and New York City herself, IN SEARCH OF GLADYS GLOVER is a time-shifting journey about the disorienting feeling of being in the city the past few years. It’s a movie for everyone who wakes up each day and continues to put one foot in front of other—laughing often, crying often, watching as many beautiful films and sports games as possible, aimlessly walking the city streets alone, making art, hanging with good friends—but ultimately doesn’t understand what the fuck is going on anymore.","popularity":0.0814,"poster_path":"/12ZoExE8C9pdET68qIvBLxnyz0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Search of Gladys Glover","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":131794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gina Telaroli","original_name":"Gina Telaroli","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66689dcd8e20d4ac4a1a0bc0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradley Eros","original_name":"Bradley Eros","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66689dd4ac5b7726059c2b96","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1049919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deragh Campbell","original_name":"Deragh Campbell","popularity":0.1579,"profile_path":"/4EWpsyfKr2FR0OL84dl5Vqcuq8Z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66689dd91474f29954a70a9f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1049916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Gross","original_name":"Hannah Gross","popularity":0.758,"profile_path":"/p94oyYrrywfSH3vkimTL1cbaWQt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66689de1c29dcea8c99c2bc2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1443168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David J.
