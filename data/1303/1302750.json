WHAT IS JAZZ? (Documentary)","overview":"At the beginning of the 20th century, a new direction in music appeared in America. Although the word \"jazz\" came into use only in 1913, this music, distinguished by its loudness, audacity, and riot, was heard on the streets of New Orleans at least ten years earlier. Jazz possessed special rhythmic energy never seen before in folk music. In addition, jazz was bold and unpredictable - the same song sounded different with each performance, and this only made jazz attractive. The musicians improvised, following the inspiration and adapting the melody to the sounds of other instruments playing with them on stage.","popularity":0.3906,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":198942,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Madoff","origin_country":""},{"id":198943,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Madoff Tv","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE HISTORY OF JAZZ.
