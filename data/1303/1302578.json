The program features rare footage of the Pack in action at the Sands' Copa Room as well as rare stills of John F. Kennedy and other Kennedy Era luminaries. The program also offers frank discussions of the racism that dominated Las Vegas in the 1950's - and Frank Sinatra's heroic efforts to end it for his good friend Sammy Davis Jr.","popularity":0.0461,"poster_path":"/ucC7UYFENKqZgj0cCzTIStAthp8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rat Pack's Las Vegas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":927,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ucC7UYFENKqZgj0cCzTIStAthp8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":653}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
