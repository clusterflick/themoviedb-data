Kubelik didn't arrive on the podium trailing clouds of glory like von Karajan or Leonard Bernstein. He seemed to just appear there, shyly and without fanfare. His 'bed hair' curling outward, making his head look like the letter w. His appearance and demeanor suggested that a timid, tentative performance was likely. Then he'd rip into a taut and crisp Eroica or an effervescent, crystalline Prague Symphony.","popularity":0.2608,"poster_path":"/oOO8zICSLlH9bSbMrzjHmgYz2Y6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1971-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":304,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Portrait of an often underrated conductor","title":"Rafael Kubelik A Portrait","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Kubelík","original_name":"Rafael Kubelík","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/p8UAqMmMu7AARcYUpDXh3zbCA4N.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5dc9aeb9ab1bc70013074e6f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":612897,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Colpi","original_name":"Henri Colpi","popularity":0.1002,"profile_path":"/sUZl1MEF2OBdiluF3QLWkR8DVt1.jpg","credit_id":"5dc9af0e99259c67b27c637d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arne Arnbom","original_name":"Arne Arnbom","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc9af23ab1bc70013074fc4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":577595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Åke Falck","original_name":"Åke Falck","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/E4UPGgFERfxXDJCUhoMocknQKf.jpg","credit_id":"5dc9aef7470ead001898e659","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oOO8zICSLlH9bSbMrzjHmgYz2Y6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1971-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
