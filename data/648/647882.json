The crew, which consists of vision-impaired people and people with normal eyesight, learns to work together in order to successfully complete their undertaking. The observational documentary shows the crew’s first contact with the boat, which is done by touch, and then follows their daily routine while at sea. The disinterested camera records a reality that overcomes our prejudices regarding the helplessness of blind people. The problem-free journey gives the sailors space for new sensations. Excerpts from the ship’s log show us aspects of the mission – i.e., the transformation of oneself that can change the world.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/5cJPzpx0mzZXCpL8gvBGhYS24nr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2017-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Slepoye kino","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2457297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grigory Glyants","original_name":"Grigory Glyants","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dcc5fc6b042280014c6986d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2457297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grigory Glyants","original_name":"Grigory Glyants","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dcc5fd2b2e0740017813607","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2457297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grigory Glyants","original_name":"Grigory Glyants","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dcc5fd779a1c30013454645","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2457297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grigory Glyants","original_name":"Grigory Glyants","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dcc5fddb76cbb0013729d05","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2457297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grigory Glyants","original_name":"Grigory Glyants","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dcc5fe3cc277c0012e0f8bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2457299,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Glyants","original_name":"Anna Glyants","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dcc5ffd1d78f2001824f9cf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1993994,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yury Geddert","original_name":"Yury Geddert","popularity":0.0529,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dcc6015cc277c0017e0e07a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"blindcinema2017","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5cJPzpx0mzZXCpL8gvBGhYS24nr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2017-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"\"Bir Duino-Kyrgyzstan\" International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2018-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"blind cinema_trailer","key":"CGFI0yMLTCQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-06-16T18:41:44.000Z","id":"5dd42213b39e3500188d2115"}]}}}
