Three years before George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead was released, director Ofelio Linares Montt shot Zombies in the Sugar Cane Field, which turned out to be both a horror film and a political statement. It was a success in the US, but could not be shown in Argentina due to Juan Carlos Onganía's dictatorship, and was eventually lost. Writer and researcher Luciano Saracino embarks on the search for the origins of this cursed work.","popularity":0.7227,"poster_path":"/1NvpmzjHrLrzCzLWjxOKPVeBXg5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Películas Zapruder","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2019-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zombies in the Sugar Cane Field: The Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1078827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Sarli","original_name":"Isabel Sarli","popularity":0.3469,"profile_path":"/2NTUtSzZivMK6n95sti2mp1cutR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Actress","credit_id":"5dc985d16c0e4f00183c84bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2009256,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luciano Saracino","original_name":"Luciano Saracino","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Researcher","credit_id":"5dc98612ab1bc700150777fe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diego Trerotola","original_name":"Diego Trerotola","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Film Critic","credit_id":"5dc9864599259c67b27c24db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2455238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Koza","original_name":"Roger Koza","popularity":0.1087,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self - Film Critic","credit_id":"5dc986617314a10012bc1334","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1584517,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laura Casabé","original_name":"Laura Casabé","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":"/mIZI0DDX6SmdpKYj1Jew0RUhvXa.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self - Filmmaker","credit_id":"5dc98679470ead001398b849","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450529,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ramiro San Honorio","original_name":"Ramiro San Honorio","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self - Film Collector","credit_id":"5dc9866bab1bc70015077895","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2455233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"César Legname","original_name":"César Legname","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ofelio Linares Montt","credit_id":"5dc985ffab1bc7001807dcf9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2455235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mónica Audi Falú","original_name":"Mónica Audi Falú","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Alicia Miranda","credit_id":"5dc9861c470ead001898b3c9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3314444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Carlos Onganía","original_name":"Juan Carlos Onganía","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/dx3jbzAS2e07qNORqUVTVW9OGZx.jpg","cast_id":30,"character":"Self - Politician (archive footage)","credit_id":"6195e12d4975600088ee11be","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George A.
