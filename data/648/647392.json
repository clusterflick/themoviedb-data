It has a cast of gazillions, characters who fly, jugglers, fire-eaters, remarkably elaborate costumes, amazingly realistic props (those five-foot oranges are convincingly juicy and edible looking), a huge set, fireworks, and so on. In fact, at times, it looks more like a Cirque de Soleil show than something you'd see in an opera house.  Director Gilbert Deflo's conception and William Orlandi's costumes and sets are rooted in commedia dell'arte, but the production is thoroughly eclectic, with allusions to a wonderfully weird assortment of styles and periods.","popularity":0.0956,"poster_path":"/ggKTAJcxgQumpr39cxO9Scn18m3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Amour des trois Oranges - Prokofiev","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Workman","original_name":"Charles Workman","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/skTWeaSHYqjjWGqYC8KoUBA7D5z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"le Prince","credit_id":"5dca830d6c0e4f00153e109d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Esther Minutillo","original_name":"Hannah Esther Minutillo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5dca831c470ead00159ad0b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Antoine","original_name":"Guillaume Antoine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5dca832b6e44bf0016ef06d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1123525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Béatrice Uria-Monzon","original_name":"Béatrice Uria-Monzon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jHzfOps9lW1B3Us24926xXQB8sQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Fata Morgana","credit_id":"5dca8335470ead00139a2763","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José van Dam","original_name":"José van Dam","popularity":0.1477,"profile_path":"/ogj5ITifaFJeg89UY4WDIu5sUTr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tchélio","credit_id":"5dca833d470ead00139a2768","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandra Zamojska","original_name":"Aleksandra Zamojska","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5dca834d6e44bf0016ef0702","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor von Halem","original_name":"Victor von Halem","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ox12y7719KccWZBKxeMOss3uMxo.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5dca8359ab1bc70015090382","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucia Cirillo","original_name":"Lucia Cirillo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sméraldine","credit_id":"5dca8364470ead00139a28cd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1703866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bizic","original_name":"David Bizic","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/9D16nvANROErXnXykwrBUF6GlRX.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"le Héraut","credit_id":"6246a775b458b800508f5d30","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1559016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert Deflo","original_name":"Gilbert Deflo","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dca83756c0e4f00153e10e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2212,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ggKTAJcxgQumpr39cxO9Scn18m3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1475}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
