One of the trains was a troop train taking soldiers to fight in World War I at the Battle of Gallipoli: many of the dead were in this train which caught fire due to escaped gas from the archaic gas lighting in the carriages. The cause of the crash was attributed to a catastrophic signalman's error, but Neil examines whether there were other contributory factors and whether there was a cover-up to prevent investigation of them, making convenient scapegoats of the signalmen.","popularity":0.3356,"poster_path":"/fjDp0KerPHvNDNfGZWmTuuyRpvc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":94391,"logo_path":"/9LCet1scydyCA3pbY6IyZVqEnHd.png","name":"Finestripe Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quintinshill: Britain's Deadliest Rail Disaster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1411953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Oliver","original_name":"Neil Oliver","popularity":0.1156,"profile_path":"/fZc3GzCc0QpuExaiKmbik7nZ9M1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"5fc95d0943999b003b164114","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2308919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Lilley","original_name":"Ian Lilley","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc97ed2470ead001398b13d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4700754","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l74LdmxmMHkt7zZu5z8iw8itJEl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fjDp0KerPHvNDNfGZWmTuuyRpvc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AacRG45zABPzGxjGI3xpF6YmNUE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2504,"name":"world war i"},{"id":10617,"name":"disaster"},{"id":18044,"name":"railroad"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
