From the street, The Weinstein House is an almost blind façade, covered in stone, from which an abstract bow window protrudes. This window, along with the house’s deep-set entrance, adds a central touch of colour and mystery to the composition. Shaped as an “L”, the house opens to a small backyard, thus creating a more private dialogue with the garden. The formal, yet paradoxically unconventional, plan of the house keeps us almost exclusively in the upper level, an exquisitely lit mazelike space.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/5zbhydyxsvTagVD1fUvYs85ImXG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125087,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruptura Silenciosa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2013-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Limpeza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2204212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Graça Dias","original_name":"Manuel Graça Dias","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc967ed99259c67b27bee1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2131378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luís Urbano","original_name":"Luís Urbano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ioKoJJ9O5tOgZvKLxo3UbTPIGW6.jpg","credit_id":"5dd614077f1d830015618526","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2131385,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rui Manuel Vieira","original_name":"Rui Manuel Vieira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd613fa3faba00019f5dc94","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2131386,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Nacarato","original_name":"Bruno Nacarato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd6141a7f1d83001561859d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5zbhydyxsvTagVD1fUvYs85ImXG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
