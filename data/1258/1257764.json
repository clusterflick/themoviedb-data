The World Is Ours is a film that gives the opportunity to six Montreal teenage girls to leave their urban environment for the first time to take part in a nature canoe-camping expedition. By presenting their struggles and small victories, the film poetically and luminously embraces their vulnerability, emphasizing in broad strokes the power of female sisterhood and therapeutic intervention by nature. Using an intervention cinema approach and seeking to democratize access to the outdoors for marginalized communities, the production of the film took on the responsibility of defraying the costs of the expedition for these six young women.","popularity":0.1288,"poster_path":"/ulEMuF5Tmw1B9yJutheL39cWpnZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World Is Ours","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadia Louis-Desmarchais","original_name":"Nadia Louis-Desmarchais","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/dqnhtsyJPYm1sNh3CWaQExeevCJ.jpg","credit_id":"65ef7450bb105701875854bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905295,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Samuel Laflamme","original_name":"Samuel Laflamme","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66140891e10f460163393df2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541835,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christophe Voyer","original_name":"Christophe Voyer","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/2syUUGmRp51HqEZLgTE3S6ZrGM7.jpg","credit_id":"661408663d74540185080087","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541835,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christophe Voyer","original_name":"Christophe Voyer","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/2syUUGmRp51HqEZLgTE3S6ZrGM7.jpg","credit_id":"661408778ee0a9017ea44342","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3058875,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Myriam Payette","original_name":"Myriam Payette","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661408199bcd0f017d2b3848","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098333,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Frédérike Labelle","original_name":"Frédérike Labelle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661407c4982f74014b5fc2f2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3065866,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jérémie Mazan","original_name":"Jérémie Mazan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66140844a6a4c10186bd9a76","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3544698,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alina Elsenhans","original_name":"Alina Elsenhans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6761f8e759514a54ccce83b8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ulEMuF5Tmw1B9yJutheL39cWpnZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Filministes 2024","release_date":"2024-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
