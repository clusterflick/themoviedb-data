Sam wants a guy on her arm; Charlie wants regular sex, now only offered in small, conditional doses. The film, shot from Charlie's perspective, provides a snapshot of the seminal moment in Sam and Charlie's relationship when harsh reality displaces their 'honeymoon' fantasies. The original soundtrack assumes Charlie's emotions as he wavers from enthusiasm, to disappointment, to blaring noise in order to drown-out his girlfriend's verbal tirade. How Sam and Charlie will proceed together is the eternal question facing most couples at the moment when lust and desire evolves to the truth and consequences inherent in all relationships between two lovers.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":223206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Billy Boy Enterprises","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saturday Stroll","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4586157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Battinelli","original_name":"Neil Battinelli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"65ef5c3e397df0018493113e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4586158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Pearl","original_name":"Alexandra Pearl","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"65ef5c7a08cf870162d5e6c2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4586140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zach Mayer","original_name":"Zach Mayer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ef5ac0158c85017cf72be8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4474252,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eldis Sula","original_name":"Eldis Sula","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/bpXqF2v5hkum1Zlkgst5FFzJX43.jpg","credit_id":"65ef5acb397df0014792bd00","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4586148,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Green","original_name":"William Green","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ef5b34d40d4c0162ea589d","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551890,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Parker Colt","original_name":"Parker Colt","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ef5bd0e25860017b4d40b5","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4586151,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Fontana","original_name":"Dan Fontana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ef5b681b7c590148b0be1e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129310,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rachel Batashvili","original_name":"Rachel Batashvili","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ef5c03158c85017cf72db1","department":"Camera","job":"First Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4474252,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eldis Sula","original_name":"Eldis Sula","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/bpXqF2v5hkum1Zlkgst5FFzJX43.jpg","credit_id":"65ef5ade08cf870185d616d4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4586146,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maia Dickinson","original_name":"Maia Dickinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ef5b071b7c59012bb0b120","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551890,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Parker Colt","original_name":"Parker Colt","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ef5bdaaf58cb014a2beca4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4586148,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Green","original_name":"William Green","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ef5b4b1b7c59012bb0b161","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3337197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan De Franco","original_name":"Ryan De Franco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ef5b8daf58cb01302be94b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4586146,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maia Dickinson","original_name":"Maia Dickinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ef5b181b7c590185b10429","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4586140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zach Mayer","original_name":"Zach Mayer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ef5ba785702e01486c4da6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4465262","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
