A meditation on reconnection, the film recounts moments from recent and distant Kenyan history. Narrated by the off-screen voice of a young child, it presents moments of frustration but also of hope, leaving space for a renewal of wisdom that has been lost. Additionally, My Cave Call weaves in spirituality, questioning in what ways humans have become disconnected from their roots with the earth. The film’s setting—first in a field and then in a cave (under Mount Suswa)—creates a surreal journey. This film was part of a larger exhibition of Wangechi Mutu’s work at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Cave Call","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2126886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wangechi Mutu","original_name":"Wangechi Mutu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ee32a01bf87600ca7725ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
