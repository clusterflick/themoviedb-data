The performers employ a range of movement vocabularies. Some gestures respond to the surrounding landscape while others stem from voguing, a style of dance that evolved from the Ballroom scene, an underground subculture created by members of the Black and Latinx LGBTQ+ community in New York, which came to prominence in the 1980s. The video features live performances by vocalists and drummers playing rhythms from the African diaspora paired with audio recordings from a 2020 Black Trans Lives march in New York, where Gibson is based.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Feel Myself Beloved on the Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4584850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Gibson","original_name":"Jeffrey Gibson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ee350a7f2d4a018102f136","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
