The video was the result of a commission by Kenzo, Paris, to create an advertisement for it's 2012 Fall/Winter clothing line.  Dis used the opportunity to create a video work which operates neither as satire nor valorization of branding, stock video, and fashion advertisements.  The work manages to function both as a critique of advertisements and, quite literally, as an advertisement itself.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lzkpSJ49Kzfwqra05gBuSuOQnYu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Watermarked","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4583787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dis Magazine","original_name":"Dis Magazine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ed86afe93e950184e1b083","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lzkpSJ49Kzfwqra05gBuSuOQnYu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
