Olga attempts to find satisfaction in teaching but secretly longs for a home and family. Masha, unhappy with her marriage to a timid schoolmaster, falls hopelessly in love with a married colonel. Irina works in the local telegraph office but longs for gaiety. Their sense of futility is increased by their brother's marriage to Natasha, a coarse peasant girl. She gradually encroaches on the family home until even the private refuge of the sisters is destroyed. They dream of starting a new life in Moscow but are saddled with the practicalities of their quiet existence. Despite their past failures, they resolve to seek some purpose and hope when the army post is withdrawn from the town.","popularity":1.9354,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5845,"logo_path":"/5ncpOZ3B1Jlb7XnMJlBho1BHCIs.png","name":"Royal Shakespeare Company","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":5846,"logo_path":"/h9O2O30eqiYaNi8qRKclV2U4Wjw.png","name":"Thames Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1981-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":191,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Three Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":162413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Bertish","original_name":"Suzanne Bertish","popularity":0.3717,"profile_path":"/6UEvYDr97XooqCBSXafsRy1KEWw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Masha","credit_id":"65edef6f78570e0164fbd261","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Dale","original_name":"Janet Dale","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":"/fvBJdlVOWlXtBUcvWvRnd81a5Hi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Olga","credit_id":"65edef89c15b550130f1311b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Godfrey","original_name":"Patrick Godfrey","popularity":0.3469,"profile_path":"/fGZMxe4VpV0rYDYbgXmyJlDO3f7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kulighin","credit_id":"65edef9c8cfcc7014a6256ab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1229885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Hill","original_name":"Rose Hill","popularity":0.5498,"profile_path":"/gdo6WF7g2kUi3bXCfVAv7i3W370.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Anfisa","credit_id":"65edefb5a9b9a4017dd68b7f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Spall","original_name":"Timothy Spall","popularity":1.0594,"profile_path":"/dEhBrDYNVpfWMDx8vpcrp4pXDwl.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Andrei","credit_id":"65edf045bdc34c018534647d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":26692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roderick Horn","original_name":"Roderick Horn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rode","credit_id":"65edefc6a9b9a40164d58740","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Griffith Jones","original_name":"Griffith Jones","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/5GT1CzdvxU0SY21QLcrHrb1UOaG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Chebutikin","credit_id":"65edefd891f0ea01868c4f1a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":951891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teddy Kempner","original_name":"Teddy Kempner","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Fedotik","credit_id":"65edefea41465c0181a1a104","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Peck","original_name":"Bob Peck","popularity":0.4649,"profile_path":"/lu4NA4mIEutkoPJ4AcKTg9vWVZe.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Solyony","credit_id":"65edeffabdc34c0185346401","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Petherbridge","original_name":"Edward Petherbridge","popularity":0.1459,"profile_path":"/mJ9hRnEhrNArBrPq1AA8eDgrKkb.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Vershinin","credit_id":"65edf01078570e0164fbd337","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Rees","original_name":"Roger Rees","popularity":0.5344,"profile_path":"/qKWG7oxTL1JGzTzHLacsNLDAbNs.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Tusenbach","credit_id":"65edf024447f9c01876142bc","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1239914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Richard","original_name":"Emily Richard","popularity":0.1844,"profile_path":"/pvkA2ld8XP5ntOO84Oo1fmW6pJC.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Irina","credit_id":"65edf0332790bf017c4597b6","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trevor Nunn","original_name":"Trevor Nunn","popularity":0.1391,"profile_path":"/uDym6D25yUYim0Ecyd05EJ01lbt.jpg","credit_id":"65edf066bdc34c00c831dc05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109469,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anton Chekhov","original_name":"Антон Чехов","popularity":0.449,"profile_path":"/jQlZSJWHZTZrBvSfqb8me8S8peP.jpg","credit_id":"65edf074e93e950184e24bd5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0491699","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
