Fulvia is a Franco-Italian filmmaker who met this rather gifted young man in Iraqi Kurdistan. When he tells her that he wants to make his way to the UK, she gets him a camera…  Thus began a 9 months’ clandestine obstacle course from Erbil to Liverpool via a Greek prison cell for illegal foreigners, all recorded on camera. Each time Soran found himself in a tight spot, Fulvia came to his rescue.  This is their four-handed film: the adventurous crossing of \"Fortress Europe\" by a Kurdish refugee with a sense of humour and a guardian angel at his side. Soran achieved his goal: turning his life into a movie.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":" Illegal Tourist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4583730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fulvia Alberti","original_name":"Fulvia Alberti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ed7732c15b550149f15811","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4583731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soran Qurbani","original_name":"Soran Qurbani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ed773d91f0ea01638b1c84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
