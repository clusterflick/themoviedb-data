Cynthia’s hypochondria, which in the recent past may have been dismissed as a  quirk, has crept into the examination of our own daily activities. The titular work of the exhibition, The  Invisible Seventh is the Mystic Column, 2021, shot and edited by Moulton while in quarantine, picks up where  Cynthia’s journey of self-investigation left off in Whispering Pines 10. In 2021 we, as audience members, are  more clearly attuned to the eccentric coping mechanisms of Moulton’s persona, as they are now uniquely  familiar to us. In The Invisible Seventh is the Mystic Column, Cynthia turns her attention to exercise and breathing techniques in an attempt to counteract vulnerability. However, she is betrayed, inhaling invasive home decor objects, similar in shape and size to human organs, which take up residence in her body.","popularity":0.0439,"poster_path":"/j7ydWHcm1gL0WDwlNhMCkoqSRGK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Invisible Seventh is the Mystic Column","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1626229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shana Moulton","original_name":"Shana Moulton","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/k2NurtqeeB6ApNp7NDYZb3nmicO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cynthia","credit_id":"65f8a0b71685da017dd729b6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1626229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shana Moulton","original_name":"Shana Moulton","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/k2NurtqeeB6ApNp7NDYZb3nmicO.jpg","credit_id":"65ef12b0001bbd01867fe45e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j7ydWHcm1gL0WDwlNhMCkoqSRGK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
