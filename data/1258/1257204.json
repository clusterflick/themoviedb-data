This digital representation fragments and layers the profile that is representative of multiple gender identities. These fragments and layers use the reflections of the elements through which gender is culturally established.  In the religious community, the name “Mary Magdalene” is the woman as flesh, the wanton woman. This film emphasizes the camera as a weapon for the filmmaker to create her own visual projection.","popularity":0.0356,"poster_path":"/gpP2wGka0QmI1yjaRkYRkQuEBRp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mary Magdalene","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1706665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"M.M.
