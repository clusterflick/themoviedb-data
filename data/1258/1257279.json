The interreligious romance between Eleni and Elmaz-aga, close to the 1821 uprising against the Ottomans, and a parental curse, haunt the history of the family and of the village alike. The folk song of Eleni leads to the awakening of a past that resembles a fairytale.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rWgS93MIuhhtZ0fTP2mEM9e80os.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lenaki, the Curse of Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitris Indares","original_name":"Δημήτρης Ινδαρές","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/lXH3P9u0nxE0vGDvbJi6vtiPnRC.jpg","credit_id":"65ee354f50733c017c39d90d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rWgS93MIuhhtZ0fTP2mEM9e80os.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1077}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
