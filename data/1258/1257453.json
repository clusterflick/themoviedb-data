The neighbors of the neighborhood visit him without any burden and share their stories. Sometimes, the neighborhood trio (Mr. Gu, Mr. Jeon, Mr. Park) tease him for being a woman, but the barber just smiles. One day, the barber gets into an argument with Mr. Gu, the owner of the hole-in-the-wall shop, due to a misunderstanding, and when Mr. Gu blurts out the word “woman,” the barber has a big fight with Mr. Gu.\r Morning comes as always. As usual, the barber’s wife tightly bandages the barber’s bulging chest. And the barber, she, rides her bicycle to the barbershop, hiding her hidden chest.","popularity":0.148,"poster_path":"/8ietToQEnoWLKzLrAVNHGdECp60.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2000-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncle 'Bar' at Barbershop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Mr. Lee Barbershop","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1625146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Yoon-mi","original_name":"이윤미","popularity":0.2709,"profile_path":"/45wk9yWgIAUxzB195VTiLn1zQe2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lee","credit_id":"67e1e476d70c61590375c881","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5144929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Choi Sung-woong","original_name":"Choi Sung-woong","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Gu","credit_id":"67e1e4917db9e70c47dc58d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Gun-ho","original_name":"Kim Gun-ho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jeon","credit_id":"67e1e4b5440f311ace75c4cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ban Jin-soo","original_name":"Ban Jin-soo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Park","credit_id":"67e1e4d34c52746665dc66f0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Seong-ae","original_name":"Lee Seong-ae","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67e1e4edeba79f6ff7f056cc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Ho-hyeop","original_name":"Lee Ho-hyeop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Young Hwan","credit_id":"67e1e507d70c61590375c8b9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kwon Jong-kwan","original_name":"Kwon Jong-kwan","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65eee9371b722c0186d516b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kwon Jong-kwan","original_name":"Kwon Jong-kwan","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65eee93ef5cb210162453f82","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1940384,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"In-dae Moon","original_name":"In-dae Moon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1e3c0d70c61590375c84e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326250,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lee Ki-won","original_name":"Lee Ki-won","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1e3d9d70c61590375c85f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326252,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kim Song-hyeon","original_name":"Kim Song-hyeon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1e3ef4c52746665dc66af","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3629466","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":754,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tn3aaAvAtkD7KPycyVSWVy5gz1p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1342}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":962,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8ietToQEnoWLKzLrAVNHGdECp60.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":648}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmasia Film Festival","release_date":"2005-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"5th Busan International Film Festival 2000","release_date":"2000-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
