By using words, we're giving shape to objects and concatenating our explanations of the world with our human experience. Words enunciate things found in the physical world, but these many ways of naming arise from different sources, since words are not a part of nature, but cultural strategies or invented tools to give meaning to things. Words can be changed and interchanged, reinforced or contradicted, and they often take forked paths. Every word is a host with whom we build a mutually interchangeable relationship; is this host a guest, a stranger or an enemy? Is the hospice we build from our words a shelter, a prison or a pathway to oblivion? How do human beings construct their own realities, their relationships with others and the story of their own existence through our world of words?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hospice of Dry Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4586495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Barbagelata","original_name":"Helena Barbagelata","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ef86ccbb10570164585f7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29820873","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
