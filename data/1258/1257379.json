While she still can, she paces the leafy hospital surroundings in search of a suicide spot. She finds the perfect tree, one with a sturdy branch from which to hang herself. Just as she loops a noose around her neck, she is interrupted by a mysterious patient named Yoshino. This slightly macabre girl is also afflicted by a disease, but a fantastical one that will see her turn into a tree. Even though Ayaka is surrounded by death, disease, and defective bodies, Yoshino’s intervention leads her to cling on to life, no matter how absurd.","popularity":0.068,"poster_path":"/6jiPiAxzyAXbcZj6cuKszHi95y9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An appreciation of life in our most dire times.","title":"Perfect Nervous","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4534056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minori Fujidera","original_name":"藤寺美徳","popularity":0.2558,"profile_path":"/u2FiXhRwM6BGF5O85llkCvYUgyT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65ee9ca913af5f017c5a6326","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3144130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akari Takaishi","original_name":"髙石あかり","popularity":0.6242,"profile_path":"/qQURz3QiOVFHOo2azpL5cQOJg3a.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65ee9cb6a14e100162e00609","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masaru Sano","original_name":"Masaru Sano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661b8fa25e14e50148bb2f0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6jiPiAxzyAXbcZj6cuKszHi95y9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
