They have done this to circumvent patriarchal structures, to avoid misogynistic attacks, to support the family economically, to avoid compelled marriage and to be free. Our characters communicate with us intimately as they talk about their lives and bring us closely into their personal journey. They speak about freedom and oppression, about the promise of sacrificing their lives for the sake of their familiesâ€™ survival. But also about the breaking of gender barriers and the power of the human mind to decide who we want to be.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":"/c26ZHHElAdpDuPP1BFFblDtio5h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House with a Voice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristine Nrecaj","original_name":"Kristine Nrecaj","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660edd5ad6dbba016371215c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Birthe Templin","original_name":"Birthe Templin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660edd48d6dbba014a6fb547","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c26ZHHElAdpDuPP1BFFblDtio5h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"26th Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"House with a Voice\" directed by Kristine Nrecaj and Birthe Templin","key":"uIcW9hfJ8HU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-03-06T10:56:55.000Z","id":"663e9b725e5a77104587c50c"}]}}}
