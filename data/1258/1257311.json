It's what brings people together; itâ€™s about family, tradition, and celebration. Food is where fusion happens. Mixed Up is a conversation about the desperate need for belonging and what it means to embrace your culture in New Zealand today. Led by Jess' introspection as she quietly cooks in a lonely studio, we meet four other women of colour: Hannah and Elizabeth, Nicky, and Matilda. Guided by a recipe and defined by different cultural experiences, we find parallels and similarities across their stories - mixed feelings of pride, shame, longing, and inspiration.","popularity":0.5733,"poster_path":"/uyNLnoQfaSy16xPhaSxEXMFSD7d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2022-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jess explores her feelings about being mixed-race and invites her friends to a celebratory potluck.
