[Magirama]","overview":"Magirama version, which is one of the four segments of the Magirama program, designed to illustrate the expressive possibilities of director Abel Gance's creation, Polyvision and Sonore Perspective, which used three screens to present a drama of simultaneous images. This program was shown the first time in 1956 in the Cinema theater \"Studio 28\" in Paris.  After serving in the trenches of World War I, Jean Diaz recoils with such horror that he renounces love and personal pleasure to immerse himself in scientific research, seeking a machine to prevent war. He thinks he has succeeded, but the government subverts his discovery, and Europe slides with seeming inevitability toward World War II. In desperation, Diaz summons the ghosts of the war dead from the graves and fields of France to give silent, accusing protest.","popularity":0.1066,"poster_path":"/2y24WeSm8cHVYy8hrW5tIvmmCKo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1956-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Accuse!
