But their carefree existence is disrupted when one of them becomes seriously ill. The others learn of his illness at different times, which leads to misunderstandings, conflicts, and eventually the sick friend’s alienation from the group. The story tells of the superficial nature of their relationships, helplessness, and disenchantment with the youth perspective.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":110190,"logo_path":"/usBz1AXGacJ0lfh3LdKlc3WsZRl.png","name":"FAMO Písek","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tomorrow's in a Few Hours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3606668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonín Brukner","original_name":"Antonín Brukner","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62bd9557097c490ba48a80ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3606669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomáš Krutina","original_name":"Tomáš Krutina","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62bd955de1faed2d2f0cdd16","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3606670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karolína Klempířová","original_name":"Karolína Klempířová","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62bd9564eb64f1058d798ed1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3606671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Štěpán Pospíšil","original_name":"Štěpán Pospíšil","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/5a4lOCNWHg5wKyWDIVd3VJTfpoY.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62bd956c63d93707f99689a7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3606672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Machová","original_name":"Marie Machová","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"62bd957f7ef3812768edb66f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3605335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Daniel","original_name":"Jan Daniel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bb98847ef38104370d8d50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3605335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Daniel","original_name":"Jan Daniel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bd94e9eb64f1058c695cf4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3606665,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kryštof Tichý","original_name":"Kryštof Tichý","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bd94ff097c490ba48a8090","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3606666,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vilém Růžička","original_name":"Vilém Růžička","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bd9517e1faed2d2f0cdccc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3606667,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Klára Šmídová","original_name":"Klára Šmídová","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bd95309a9f9a0051760cef","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":280617,"name":"student film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Karlovy Vary International Film Festival","release_date":"2022-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
