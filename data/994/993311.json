It is both where the economic crisis has acquired its most acute form and where the revolutionary backlash by the masses has been the most advanced. We are pleased to present Greece on the Brink, a documentary that follows the course of the Greek crisis from a Marxist perspective. The documentary gives an in-depth insight into the profound crisis that Greece is facing today. Greece took over the EU Presidency at the beginning of this year. At different festivities celebrating this occasion, European and Greek politicians have tried to ensure the public by claiming that the worst parts of the crisis is over. However, reality is entirely different. The country, which is facing the seventh year of recession, is in a state of disintegration at all levels: financially, socially and politically.","popularity":1.4116,"poster_path":"/vuKkehE4mX1oPkF60IZRN7hRMjP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greece on the Brink","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3605070,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Manuel Reichetseder","original_name":"Manuel Reichetseder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bb35d87ef381043539577d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3605070,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Manuel Reichetseder","original_name":"Manuel Reichetseder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bb35eb7ef38104370d6d1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3738750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1wNbZZcSx0DtMYN3sQaOprUMQbr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vuKkehE4mX1oPkF60IZRN7hRMjP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1200,"name":"greece"},{"id":165193,"name":"financial crisis"},{"id":169358,"name":"financial problem"},{"id":233831,"name":"financial crash"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Greece on the Brink - Documentary - Trailer","key":"TIlrvRn9Kh4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-02-12T21:54:56.000Z","id":"62bb33927ef381043685852d"}]}}}
