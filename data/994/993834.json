The thought of being in the class play about the solar system makes her itch and scratch and twirl her hair. But when she's alone or with her best friend, Opal, Violet is a master performer, mimicking her classmates and retaliating against Irwin with razor-sharp wit. Her chance for real-life revenge comes at last during the play, when she plays the offstage role of Lady Space. On opening night, when Irwin, a.k.a. Mars, starts to spin out of control and forgets his lines, Violet saves the day (but not without a little of her savage humor).","popularity":0.2796,"poster_path":"/qSnfgEXOm1XtKDgNrFD3tGDX4nI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13636,"logo_path":"/qTvhJHw5ixJX9t0cR81cF4eVvfO.png","name":"Weston Woods Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shrinking Violet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Calista Flockhart","original_name":"Calista Flockhart","popularity":0.7773,"profile_path":"/s0YPPAaIO5fnWI9baxp4TIkUXmn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62bcceb617792c0053792ad5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary McGivney","original_name":"Gary McGivney","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bccec7356a71147bd7b823","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3606144,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giselle Potter","original_name":"Giselle Potter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bccef0e1faed1dc776c286","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qSnfgEXOm1XtKDgNrFD3tGDX4nI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
