How a city that no longer exists might appear, having disappeared. Instead, in its place a vast toxic swamp, spewing ocherous smoke and chemical waste, with electric blue sulphurous flames emerging from the dead land. Shot on location in and amongst the craters and sulphur mines of the Ijen volcano complex in Indonesia, the imagery is accompanied by a recording of Herbert Read reciting his poem ‘The Autumn of the World’.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/oMrC67qowgtVvHCA5IzY9Pmyglx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ijen / London","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Rivers","original_name":"Ben Rivers","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/4WUVJwo0o5nE63xROHGRcSJ7O1T.jpg","credit_id":"62bb9e2923bcf4008c7bd3e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30319609","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bbWzCocnQP1Re7Jkjc6gdqRkh7W.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2523},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A0Nl5IgWcehSzNbvukPxOQVB1gs.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2523},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8xTE5sl0FECCTYt0rJuVYm1RyXY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2523},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A0Nl5IgWcehSzNbvukPxOQVB1gs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2523},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2RCAWZUGfzq73csCvA1lvWpwsTv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2523}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oMrC67qowgtVvHCA5IzY9Pmyglx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r51LIMOGQ3I2Z5WH07PCPLEAMPw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":2712,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1ZQSnzu4PE40ksrJteRpaXv37DS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1950}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
