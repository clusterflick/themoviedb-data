There is something inherently handmade about their disguise, as the  individual stick-appendages hang loosely together, and the success of their camouflage depends upon their coordination as they co-operate. The twig is neither entirely ghostly nor entirely physical matter –it is a fiction with three-dimensional features in a real filmed setting.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":"/bS03BE6hHnPNXXUt07JTeDJhlG7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking Stick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3604881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Spengemann","original_name":"Paul Spengemann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bafafe3d43e013f79eeec5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bS03BE6hHnPNXXUt07JTeDJhlG7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
