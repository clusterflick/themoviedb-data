This is the dramatic story of that crucial battle, a fight which would dispel the myth of the \"invincible\" Confederate cavalry forever...This video features a magnificent reconstruction of the Battle of Brandy Station specially filmed in Virginia, the largest cavalry re-enactment ever staged in America.  Also featuring superb dramatised \"eye-witness\" accounts, computer generated 3D mapping techniques plus delightful period imagery and photographs, this programme provides an unforgettable record of a vital day in the American Civil War.","popularity":0.0646,"poster_path":"/obbkUMrr7PAJPS0ex8bLjZcOsq5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle of Gettysburg","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2753668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Leighton","original_name":"Michael Leighton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62bccd5f63d9370092b9c886","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438959,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Gormlie","original_name":"Chris Gormlie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bccd7d63d93700613bb127","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Carruthers","original_name":"Bob Carruthers","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/vWqpErkseOgbYYiKoc0VvmEvHDX.jpg","credit_id":"62bcccf4229ae22291ccc8a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1945864,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vanessa Tovell","original_name":"Vanessa Tovell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bccd94eb64f1005143fcf3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3606140,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Donald Cumming","original_name":"Donald Cumming","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bccd4312aabc0e419cfcfd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":928,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xvqKuGyU6dIc9wsCpKjBi4EaIVQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1650}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1472,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/obbkUMrr7PAJPS0ex8bLjZcOsq5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":981},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1527,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tZw6AZKxNxMWT6DjUJvGjfxP62A.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1018}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Copyright stamp","release_date":"1998-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
