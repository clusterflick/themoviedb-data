When detective Law is investigating a jewellery heist, he is ambushed by the men from Dog Stone (Sek Yin-tsi) who is the owner of Club 99. Then, Law's daughter Fong (Law Yim-hing) helps her father to be undercover and disguises herself as a dancer in the club and gambler Lung (Lam Kau) is also an informant for the police force. While Dog Stone is cunning enough to discover their identities, there are in fact more undercover agents in the club...Influenced by Hollywood's semi-documentary style, the film has a detailed yet complex portrayal of human nature－undercover anxieties, domineering gangsters and moral ambiguity. With its realistic chasing and action sequences, the film is nonetheless a very entertaining piece of cinema.","popularity":0.1787,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":158843,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lap Tat Film Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1956-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Murder Case at Club 99","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sek Yin-Tsi","original_name":"石燕子","popularity":0.2309,"profile_path":"/eKgcybzbHC0GvK4s8X6xebIyiWP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62bd83267ef3812767f2ff60","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":567302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Law Yim-Hing","original_name":"Law Yim-Hing","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/fcMqjVfsK5pQMiabjf1y8RUro2t.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62bd834b8b959e140b354684","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":990778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lam Kau","original_name":"Lam Kau","popularity":0.4297,"profile_path":"/7P4smSKH60iAvfFI9Xg6Eu6m9mL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62bd835b8b959e140acc9320","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1698167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chun Siu-Lei","original_name":"Chun Siu-Lei","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/i6Fhn6T1FSNGYI7bi4ViYFJPJ9S.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62bd83688b959e140b354698","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1591628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chan Lo-Wah","original_name":"Chan Lo-Wah","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62bd837d8b959e140acc933a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Pang-Fei","original_name":"Lee Pang-Fei","popularity":0.1556,"profile_path":"/anQskwwtirj1wUgYSIGn45GV76J.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62bdbf646840cc005368d7f7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1698175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fung Ying-Seung","original_name":"Fung Ying-Seung","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"62c25f442a09bc004c6aad98","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Yuen Siu-Tien","original_name":"袁小田","popularity":1.3295,"profile_path":"/qFtXiQQlgDYkHodlfkjTf8vSO9l.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"631864c60f0da5007def64c0","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1699244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chu Chiu","original_name":"Chu Chiu","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bd83dfeb64f1058d7981aa","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ku Wen-Chung","original_name":"Ku Wen-Chung","popularity":0.1844,"profile_path":"/r2eDfq5Ccze0Nzu2RnrGB8Mr7Ch.jpg","credit_id":"62bd83bf7ef3812769186883","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":567302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Law Yim-Hing","original_name":"Law Yim-Hing","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/fcMqjVfsK5pQMiabjf1y8RUro2t.jpg","credit_id":"62bdbfd69a9f9a008bf7bb23","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3120714,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fan Ka-Ken","original_name":"Fan Ka-Ken","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bdbf95e1faed2d30b4e5a7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193499,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hui Lap-Tsai","original_name":"Hui Lap-Tsai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bdbf87eb64f1058c697913","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1698167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chun Siu-Lei","original_name":"Chun Siu-Lei","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/i6Fhn6T1FSNGYI7bi4ViYFJPJ9S.jpg","credit_id":"62bdbfe46840cc005368d83b","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"1956-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
