At the conference, they conduct interviews with punk women, performers and artists, including Penny Arcade and Sadie Benning. In doing so, Glennda and Fonda navigate a range of perspectives on feminism, punk, and underground activism. Furthermore, they engage with questions of drag’s relationship with feminism, and how one would reconcile the problems of punk with Riot Grrrl’s desire for women’s liberation.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/2Po4Ar8Qz9vCMUuZ4o5edKFoeB2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Grrrls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2020326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Glenn Belverio","original_name":"Glenn Belverio","popularity":0.1463,"profile_path":"/jdyEpv75AeXBDRyXg0VXCpa5BfC.jpg","credit_id":"62bcc99f17792c005379286d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Po4Ar8Qz9vCMUuZ4o5edKFoeB2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
