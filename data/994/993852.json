Ingoldsby’s poems and candid anecdotes bear witness to a visceral relationship with his beloved Dublin, fellow Dubliners and anything that catches his interest. Personal challenges, a sensitive humanity and a lifetime as a maverick have taught him to harness reality and reach well beyond it to avenge the banal with absurd magic. It heals him as it does us.","popularity":0.606,"poster_path":"/jiOiFbu4dBWMNEhkqKgiM45dZ6e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116392,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broadstone
