The clip is of a family hiding behind a wall in a neighbourhood in Beirut, Lebanon. The neighbourhood has become a warzone. Over time the compressed video is slowed down, enlarged, and gets a new soundscape. Additional dimensions are revealed in the scene, and a troubling contrast between imagery and content is created, leading to an anxiously destabilising affect in the viewer.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/hwSsZkaSoF1BrSbGP1agZrvdUxV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Excerpt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guli Silberstein","original_name":"Guli Silberstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gz9uRztvQT7lQzaAc030EmhO6qv.jpg","credit_id":"62bcdca41b722c008b879a3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hwSsZkaSoF1BrSbGP1agZrvdUxV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
