Spengemann’s Pocket Call prompts the observer to think about the tension between technical feasibility and chaotic chance. In his works, Spengemann negotiates subjects that elude technical and industrial reproduction (e.g. life itself, the universe, chance), but does so by hyper-technical means. He builds replicas of mistakes, connects pixels to make polygons, which then become specks of dust, threads, or bits of fluff, which condense in the dark cavern of a trouser pocket. In this way, he re-asks the fundamental ontologi- cal question of what substance the world is really made of and how in this materialist perspective anything new can emerge – without retreating into esotericism and metaphysics.\"  Excerpt of: Martin Karcher, But the laser steers all things, 2021","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/z8ODJQlUPB00o2idiqTf12Vmbdn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pocket Call","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3604881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Spengemann","original_name":"Paul Spengemann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62baf84d12aabc061cb1af26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z8ODJQlUPB00o2idiqTf12Vmbdn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
