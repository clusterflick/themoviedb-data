From the 1940s, the Lepcha of Tingvong village gradually abandoned hunting, gathering and the slash and burn cultivation of dry rice, and became settled agriculturalists. Entire mountains sides were converted to cardamom and terraced for the cultivation of irrigated paddy. The irrigated rice and the cardamom cash crop not only brought the Lepcha within Sikkimâ€™s market economy but helped create a surplus which could among other things be invested in religion. In the 1940s, the Lepcha of Tingvong embraced Buddhism and all its complex rituals without however abandoning their strong shamanic traditions. Today, both forms of rituals amiably co-exist in the village. This film is part of a long-term visual anthropology training project for the tribal communities of Sikkim.","popularity":0.0861,"poster_path":"/mdEijhQokiVwhLcjvApsgAnqFF4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tingvong: A Lepcha Village in Sikkim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3605371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dawa T Lepcha","original_name":"Dawa T Lepcha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bbb2e5356a710051ca603b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3605372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Balikci-Denjongpa","original_name":"Anna Balikci-Denjongpa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bbb2ed2e2b2c031d2552c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2984892,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Asen Balikci","original_name":"Asen Balikci","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bbb2f92e2b2c031eb6e448","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":777,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mdEijhQokiVwhLcjvApsgAnqFF4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":517},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o79z7qVlKKsNe1PkVGMO24plY6M.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
