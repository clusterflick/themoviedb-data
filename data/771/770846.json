In long, tightly framed shots, a picture emerges of three intimately interwoven lives: the gentle and touching bickering between Nan and his mother, the evenings in front of the television when time seems to stand still, and the minutes ticking by as Grandpa silently peels an apple. In the film, disability is not only seen as symptoms on individual bodies, but as social, physical, and temporal relationships. It is a meditation on time, disabilities, and the economies of care in contemporary China.","popularity":0.3003,"poster_path":"/dswDXrK3lvUAovxXzrGN518w0Mt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2878294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nan Peng","original_name":"Nan Peng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fc72b9fb84f94003f1056aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2878295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shuhua Wu","original_name":"Shuhua Wu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fc72bad21c4ca003f208b3e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2878296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiewu Peng","original_name":"Tiewu Peng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fc72bbd20e6a5003d24f93d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1937039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peng Zuqiang","original_name":"Peng Zu-Qiang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc7149fd132d6003f1e85e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1937039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peng Zuqiang","original_name":"Peng Zu-Qiang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3ac50848eb90040de0dfd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1937039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peng Zuqiang","original_name":"Peng Zu-Qiang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3ac48cee481003ee16d44","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889867,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zhang Mengtai","original_name":"Zhang Mengtai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3ac90735205003fe7961c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889866,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hu Liwei","original_name":"Hu Liwei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3aca4f056d5003d63922d","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889866,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hu Liwei","original_name":"Hu Liwei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3ac726dea3a003cdefa41","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1937039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peng Zuqiang","original_name":"Peng Zu-Qiang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd3ac3e524978003cf2db02","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13458592","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2592,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dswDXrK3lvUAovxXzrGN518w0Mt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":195593,"name":"physical disability"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Film Dokumenter","release_date":"2020-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Documentary Festival Amsterdam","release_date":"2020-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Festival Film Dokumenter 2020 | Trailer - Nan","key":"KBeccTobIlo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-25T10:33:03.000Z","id":"5fc7168d63536a00412a09bf"}]}}}
