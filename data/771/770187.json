McLaren opens up to director (and sometime neighbour) Simon Mark-Brown about his life and inspirations â€” plus his decision to live off the grid, only venturing back to Auckland to replenish vital supplies. Mark-Brown partially shot the documentary during the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown, and its theme of self-isolation is especially resonant in pandemic times. Mark-Brown's CV includes feature The Catch and wine documentary A Seat at the Table.","popularity":0.074,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":144734,"logo_path":null,"name":"Republic Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2020-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of one man, and one tiny island","title":"The Man on the Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"The Man on the Island: Colin McLaren","type":"Streaming title (Foxtel)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4770742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin McLaren","original_name":"Colin McLaren","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"self","credit_id":"66697197474dfcb4fed05133","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2875686,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gill Civil","original_name":"Gill Civil","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc48c9b174a870041e46d99","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Mark-Brown","original_name":"Simon Mark-Brown","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc48cc1420228003ec2e69c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2875687,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edwin Dolinski","original_name":"Edwin Dolinski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc48ca6dcf875003ed82fa3","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Mark-Brown","original_name":"Simon Mark-Brown","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc48cc92bcf67003fc2ed25","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Mark-Brown","original_name":"Simon Mark-Brown","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc48cd36c449c003c3a1d5c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362069,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bertrand Remaut","original_name":"Bertrand Remaut","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc48cdf63536a004126ef25","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Man On The Island, World Premiere, Doc Edge @ The Civic, Sunday 22 November 2020.","key":"j7Rc6KY5loE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-08T05:33:09.000Z","id":"5fc48d2f813cb60042772407"}]}}}
