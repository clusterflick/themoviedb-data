Photography was still in its infancy when he opened his first studio in Montreal in the late 1850s. He rapidly turned his art, and a budding technology, into a highly successful business. Within 5 years he was appointed Photographer to the Queen. Not content with doing mere portraiture, he saw photography as a means of documenting history. With the use of props in his studio, composite photographs, and calling on his background as a trained artist, Notman immortalized the people and places of Canada.","popularity":0.08,"poster_path":"/kkp1gyBb7F3jq47Z652CxG5nXlB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notman's World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1641053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Kish","original_name":"Albert Kish","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc4a8f4b84f9400420d77b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1641053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Kish","original_name":"Albert Kish","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc4a927174a87003fe4eb12","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1636786,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Barry Perles","original_name":"Barry Perles","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc4a951420228003dc37edd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0227148","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kkp1gyBb7F3jq47Z652CxG5nXlB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
