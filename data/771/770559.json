Taking the symbolic concepts of archeology on loan, the documentary goes in search of the “horizons” of history, memory and now, which portray narratives of the residents, shopkeepers and neighborhood goers. As in an excavation, the short investigates the history of Pinheiros from the indigenous village to the occupations of today, going through layers of time to understand urban processes and imagine future for the city.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2019-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cadê o bonde que passava aqui?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Tye","original_name":"Gabriel Tye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc639bb2fdec6003d79f319","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"cadeobonde","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Portuguese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Portuguese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"pt\", \"native_name\"=>\"Portuguese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
