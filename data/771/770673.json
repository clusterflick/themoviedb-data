Such operations often take place at night, which is very exhausting for doctors. To warn people against an accident, Vadim starts a video blog. He films his surgeries, records interviews with patients, and reminds them about safety. One day, a difficult patient who has lost a hand is admitted to the hospital. He doesn't know how he's going to live, and he's not sure if the doctor will be able to save his arm this time.","popularity":0.0994,"poster_path":"/jhRPBbP8KdZMZNb7vfZiEPSLNZa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170204,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bring Back My Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Vernite moi ruki","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konstantin Selin","original_name":"Konstantin Selin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6b74bd132d600411eaedf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konstantin Selin","original_name":"Konstantin Selin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f4e2d813cb600418222b9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konstantin Selin","original_name":"Konstantin Selin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f4e33dd83fa003e940a0b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2952271,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vadim Keosyan","original_name":"Vadim Keosyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f4e3e813cb60042808fc9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2952273,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anastasiya Vladimirova","original_name":"Anastasiya Vladimirova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f4e5a0e597b003e32ee78","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2358643,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anastasiya Rytsina","original_name":"Anastasiya Rytsina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f4e73813cb60041822356","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":842,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t1DmyaUy4DdW1l9nMv0q1jLeXZr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1495}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1758,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jhRPBbP8KdZMZNb7vfZiEPSLNZa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1172},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bs6mQl6jB9QX2Oo1Y006h9WsbRu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Window To Europe Russian Film Festival","release_date":"2020-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
