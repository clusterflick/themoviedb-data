The following day, she died in hospital.  In May 2020, a new element was added to judicial investigation that was ongoing: the report of a ballistics expert, intended to establish whether the officer who fired the shot, a member of Franceâ€™s CRS riot police, had followed procedure. The report clears the officer, who has still not been identified. Using elements of that report, and a detailed 3D model of the scene, Disclose and Forensic Architecture re-examined the case, reconstructing the precise sequence of events before, during, and after the killing.","popularity":0.095,"poster_path":"/yHlyXMwlfX5tHEe6NQJiETyRaAU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Killing of Zineb Redouane","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2773522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forensic Architecture","original_name":"Forensic Architecture","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c0e23712c604017c04848e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yHlyXMwlfX5tHEe6NQJiETyRaAU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8DwWL2uQOSIWEy5HEGjnsJR0T01.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
