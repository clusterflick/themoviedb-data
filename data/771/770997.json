Hector Camacho's dynamic speed, footwork and power made him a fighter to be reckoned with, but it was his flamboyance and showmanship that ushered in a new era in boxing. The film chronicles his epic battles inside the ring, his struggles with addiction outside of it and the mystery of the double homicide that claimed his life. It's an unflinching portrait of a fighter who transcended the sport but ultimately couldn't defeat his own demons.","popularity":0.2391,"poster_path":"/jYpMAnLaB0Nt8YiW9yo5Lf8IjGP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81241,"logo_path":"/nHWiGjxnQLfChinEbl4rUd9EdqD.png","name":"Showtime Sports","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Macho: The Hector Camacho Story","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Héctor Camacho","original_name":"Héctor Camacho","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fc813c2383df2003d55bfeb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Drath","original_name":"Eric Drath","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":"/xth9xMKNFEfViVitMPzXK3D4nKt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5fc813da5f4b730041e4a012","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937662,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alistair Shurman","original_name":"Alistair Shurman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6418af4c2b8a43007b79184f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1072608,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Morreale","original_name":"Andrew Morreale","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcb9f0b8261ee003f40fa54","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Drath","original_name":"Eric Drath","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":"/xth9xMKNFEfViVitMPzXK3D4nKt.jpg","credit_id":"5fcb9f2c43999b003d1809f8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Drath","original_name":"Eric Drath","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":"/xth9xMKNFEfViVitMPzXK3D4nKt.jpg","credit_id":"5fcb9e94a5743d003f05a381","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2882637,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Danielle Naassana","original_name":"Danielle Naassana","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcb9f2411386c003ccf7c5f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1904555,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aaron Cohen","original_name":"Aaron Cohen","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcb9f5d8261ee003e3fb3e6","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2882635,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tres Driscoll","original_name":"Tres Driscoll","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcb9ec67314a10040cb8b94","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2184835,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Valverde","original_name":"Michael Valverde","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcb9fa60b7316003f073c0a","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1904555,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aaron Cohen","original_name":"Aaron Cohen","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcb9ea0383df2003e5a9516","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2882634,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"William Vargas","original_name":"William Vargas","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcb9eb7dcf875003f42bef4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13357738","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3d9qSSlLyY6sVqXb0G6S1eSaDH8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jYpMAnLaB0Nt8YiW9yo5Lf8IjGP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
