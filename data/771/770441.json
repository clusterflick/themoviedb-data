However, the author himself intended this composition to be performed in church, and on special occasions. Conducted by Teodor Currentzis and performed by soloists and musicAeterna choir and orchestra, Verdi’s famous funeral mass returns from the concert stage to Milan’s Church of San Marco, the same place where it was premiered in 1874.  The seven parts of the Requiem become steps on the way to comprehending the sacrament of death, the operatic character of orchestral and vocal writing acquires the strictness of the Catholic tradition, and musical images of rage, despair, and rebellion against the inevitable end are crowned with appeasement.","popularity":0.5481,"poster_path":"/mDp5EHeR5ds6OCUnx0No7Lh0bOo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187807,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gingerlemon","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":131162,"logo_path":"/bAnJavhJFsBwIJW7zhyMJX5tkVc.png","name":"Euromedia","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":187809,"logo_path":null,"name":"Calle
