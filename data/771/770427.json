People are surrounded by emptiness, and loneliness has filled their hearts. / If it's that painful, you can stop. / If you really don't like it, you can run away. / Do you want to be at ease? To feel at peace? Do you want to become one with me? To have our bodies and souls become one? / But if I have to be with you, I'd rather die! / Don't worry. All living things have the ability to return to their original form, and for the heart to go on living. / Reality does involve pain, but you just have to accept it. / Anywhere can be heaven as long as you have the will to live.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/aaP2I4XGZeRCV64MiC0BClQsddh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"nothing hurts, and you won’t be","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2618001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Audrey Robinovitz","original_name":"Audrey Robinovitz","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc67d1863536a003f2abe75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1062,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aaP2I4XGZeRCV64MiC0BClQsddh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":708}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
