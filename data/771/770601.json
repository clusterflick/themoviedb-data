Playing over 20 characters in a tour de force performance, Martin Prest brings Charles Dickens' timeless story of redemption to life. Miserly and unrepentant Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by his deceased business partner, Jacob Marley, one fateful Christmas Eve. Marley warns Scrooge that he will be haunted by three spirits and that, without their help, he will be condemned. Through the course of the night he is shown his Past, his Present and his Future by these spirits. He learns how his actions affect those around him and, also, how they have been affecting his own life. As popular now as when it was first published in 1843, this captivating seasonal tale has the feel good factor of a roast Christmas dinner and presents under the tree. The perfect start to any Christmas.","popularity":0.2083,"poster_path":"/1ylyE5qfg10XzwUAqrNuQepn6aP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144821,"logo_path":null,"name":"That's My Cue Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Christmas Carol","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Spring","original_name":"Jack Spring","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc677e4b84f940042101bf8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877410,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Prest","original_name":"Martin Prest","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc677f3df857c003e5e637a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7820614","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kPfRV18DjZa92VLoBvRGlAWBoNY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1ylyE5qfg10XzwUAqrNuQepn6aP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"AP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
