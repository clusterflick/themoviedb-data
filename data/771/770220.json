But after the sudden death of her mother, Smilla literally fled from home ten years ago. After a long time Smilla wants to spend time in her old home again. But she can't last long at home without getting into an argument with her father Heinrich (Jürgen Tarrach). Of course, as so often, this revolves around Heinrich's new wife Regina (Andrea Sawatzki). Without further ado, Smilla stays with her friend Hedi (Hanna Plaß) earlier than planned. She lives together with her brother Victor (Jochen Schropp), his husband Lorenz (Lucas Reiber) as well as two mini pigs and two chickens on the \"dwarf
