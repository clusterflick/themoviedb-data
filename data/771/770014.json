The dismissal of a worker in a factory shows his colleagues the instability of their situation. From the discussion that followed this event germinated the idea of ​​a union. A national union is consulted, which appoints a representative to explain the advantages and operation of a workers' union. Branch No. 100 is created and immediately becomes a trading agency; subsequently, it obtains better working conditions for the workers.
