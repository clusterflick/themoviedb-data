A question that applies to the multi-ethnic urban Indigenous community of Aldeia Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as they face increased pressure ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. The Indigenous group lives right next to the sport stadium that stages the finals of both sport events. They wish to maintain their land as an Indigenous meeting place, like it has been since the early 20th century, but that does not correspond with the plans of the Brazilian authorities and the corporations coming with the sport events. From within the Indigenous settlement, the film explores how the arrival of the sport events is being experienced, how the pressure rises and how the community resists.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qmPRJyMhe3w68AsbRuPZRqfDuWu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2019-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Village Resists","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natália dos Gatos","original_name":"Natália dos Gatos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc6c7fa21c4ca00421f9590","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werá Mirim","original_name":"Werá Mirim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc6c80eb84f9400421096d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Urutau Guajajara","original_name":"Urutau Guajajara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc6c81ca1074b0042ebe056","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Tokano","original_name":"Carlos Tokano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc6c83063536a00412993c6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bert Joris Dhert","original_name":"David Bert Joris Dhert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d364b32fccee0185a62bdd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bert Joris Dhert","original_name":"David Bert Joris Dhert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6c682df857c003f5ec4e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bert Joris Dhert","original_name":"David Bert Joris Dhert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6c69b3a340b003fe0d011","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bert Joris Dhert","original_name":"David Bert Joris Dhert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6c6911b72940041921ab5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31393023","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qmPRJyMhe3w68AsbRuPZRqfDuWu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ethnofest - Athens Ethnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2019-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Village Resists (trailer)","key":"8toErD1bfJE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-11-22T11:26:42.000Z","id":"65d365368de0ae0163d88c1d"}]}}}
