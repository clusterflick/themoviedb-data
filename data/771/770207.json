The Tender Trap of Espionage, made two years before Dr. No (1962) which kickstarted the Bond film craze, is a story of intrigue between spies and counterspies within the Japanese Occupation force. The film was shot in Taiwan, offering unique visages, with cat-and-mouse mind games set in motion against trust, betrayal and seduction. Based on the British film The Two-Headed Spy (1958), future action maestro Chang Cheh wrote the script while husband-and-wife team Lo Wei and Lau Leung-wah star together as agents, with Lo doubling as director.","popularity":0.369,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12057,"logo_path":null,"name":"Far East","origin_country":""},{"id":83141,"logo_path":null,"name":"Swank Motion Picture","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1960-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tender Trap of Espionage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1582105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Liang-Hua","original_name":"Liu Liang-Hua","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/pVU3XHTCvAun8VEGNYHDSUeq9kZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc4af6d0328b9003f6b8b91","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lo Wei","original_name":"Lo Wei","popularity":0.3718,"profile_path":"/qo5dFi2icEcJPDxQy1VdU0uJgcO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc4af910328b9003d6b28f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2246829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shih Chin","original_name":"Shih Chin","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc4afa74d6791003bdb6b9c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Kuan-Chang","original_name":"Li Kuan-Chang","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/dNhw3mGaqpUTAQXUrBOwuSUidPG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc4afb49f5dfb003f609e9a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wen Ling","original_name":"Wen Ling","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc4afdd0328b9003e6ad613","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Ying","original_name":"Lee Ying","popularity":0.1718,"profile_path":"/zFeRQ97JwIDxjGHNeEU6MWWK6E6.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"李五","credit_id":"66131dc16c84920162fbfc48","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lo Wei","original_name":"Lo Wei","popularity":0.3718,"profile_path":"/qo5dFi2icEcJPDxQy1VdU0uJgcO.jpg","credit_id":"5fc4aff53a340b0040dfba74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Cheh","original_name":"張徹","popularity":0.3633,"profile_path":"/5AWIo52OoCXL8zb9pAE62azvTLX.jpg","credit_id":"5fc4b003dcf8750041d80477","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278220,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Liu Chi","original_name":"Liu Chi","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc4b04c21c4ca003f1d32a1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699243,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shen Yu-Qi","original_name":"Shen Yu-Qi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc4b0738a84d2003f136f8f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2875743,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wang Chengfang","original_name":"Wang Chengfang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc4b0bbd2f5b5003ed999ce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":470,"name":"spy"},{"id":9322,"name":"taiwan"},{"id":11133,"name":"japanese occupation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Chinese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Mandarin\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"zh\", \"native_name\"=>\"Chinese\"}","note":"","release_date":"1960-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
