Antigone in Ferguson was conceived in the wake of Michael Brown’s death in 2014.  In this version, Oscar Isaac—who plays the Theban king Creon—is joined by Tracie Thoms as Antigone, Marjolaine Goldsmith as her sister, Ato Blankson Wood as her fiancé, Willie Woodmore as the blind prophet Tiresias & New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams as a messenger & guard. A live choir conducted by Dr. Philip Woodmore will accompany the performance, & two of its soloists, De-Rance Blaylock & Duane Foster, have a special relationship to the subject: They were Michael Brown's teachers.","popularity":0.4101,"poster_path":"/5ZP51LJi12wdQaj0vDwzy6jwpuC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antigone in Ferguson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Isaac","original_name":"Oscar Isaac","popularity":7.3804,"profile_path":"/dW5U5yrIIPmMjRThR9KT2xH6nTz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Creon","credit_id":"5fc6b8cc156cc7004021a3b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracie Thoms","original_name":"Tracie Thoms","popularity":1.0746,"profile_path":"/fOyAo4KucqxaSd2obOKufwNMwGQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Antigone","credit_id":"5fc6b8dbfcf9070041f4bbfe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1719596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ato Blankson-Wood","original_name":"Ato Blankson-Wood","popularity":0.1415,"profile_path":"/7LkEG7Clu3jLdd2p1OqBcoBvFLq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Haimon","credit_id":"5fc6b97420e6a5003b245ca0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjolaine Goldsmith","original_name":"Marjolaine Goldsmith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ismene","credit_id":"5fc6b98cd132d600411eb1c4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willie Woodmore","original_name":"Willie Woodmore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tiresias","credit_id":"5fc6b9a421c4ca00421f8456","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jumaane Williams","original_name":"Jumaane Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Messenger / Guard","credit_id":"5fc6b9b7b84f94003f0fa2ea","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Philip Woodmore","original_name":"Dr. Philip Woodmore","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5fc6b9c613a388003e04ca33","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"De-Rance Blaylock","original_name":"De-Rance Blaylock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Soloist","credit_id":"5fc6b9d41b7294003e90e626","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duane Foster","original_name":"Duane Foster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Soloist","credit_id":"5fc6b9e7fba6250042a2b087","order":8}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ZP51LJi12wdQaj0vDwzy6jwpuC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
