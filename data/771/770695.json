As they had overstayed their time limit at the national centre for illegal immigrants, the authorities had no strategy for how to deal with them, so the seven refugees were simply let go. They had no identity documents and no money. They didn’t speak the language. They didn’t even have a legal option for leaving Latvia. Two of them were underage. The seven Somalians found help and a place to stay in Latvia, but not through official channels. The Somalian protagonists in this film ended up choosing separate paths. Some of them have left Latvia and moved to a more welcoming country. Some have chosen to stay – they have learned the language and enjoy living in Latvia. The case of the seven Somalians is an extreme example of how unprepared Latvian society is for the upcoming increase in multiculturalism, ethnic diversity, and migration.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/tjLHyAHORnXLXR0dQL5LyawWtMI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144831,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elm Media","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2013-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Were The First","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2866213,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jānis Zaneribs","original_name":"Jānis Zaneribs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6c1fd13a388003e04d600","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaspars Goba","original_name":"Kaspars Goba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wXLmsBPD9mjfmowlReXKdw0YHDm.jpg","credit_id":"5fc6c17bfcf9070040f4cf44","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaspars Goba","original_name":"Kaspars Goba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wXLmsBPD9mjfmowlReXKdw0YHDm.jpg","credit_id":"5fc6c18920e6a5003b2469be","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877774,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ieva Goba","original_name":"Ieva Goba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6c23d21c4ca0041204d6e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877765,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lelde Goba","original_name":"Lelde Goba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6c1a6420228003ec5671f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877767,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marģeris Eglītis","original_name":"Marģeris Eglītis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6c1d1b84f9400410ee032","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaspars Goba","original_name":"Kaspars Goba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wXLmsBPD9mjfmowlReXKdw0YHDm.jpg","credit_id":"5fc6c15e156cc7004121be4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877766,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Inese Apse","original_name":"Inese Apse","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6c1bafcf907003ff4c6dc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877772,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Visvaldis Zarakovskis","original_name":"Visvaldis Zarakovskis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6c22a2f8d0900411023c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2754199,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gatis Belogrudovs","original_name":"Gatis Belogrudovs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6c215c2b9df004047743a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856968,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Agris Birzulis","original_name":"Agris Birzulis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6c1e6420228003ec5672e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tjLHyAHORnXLXR0dQL5LyawWtMI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
