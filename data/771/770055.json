When Palau's voters made it the first nation in history to adopt a nuclear free, green constitution, Washington's war planners saw it as 'the threat of a good example.'  Palau became the poster child for the growing Nuclear Free Pacific movement and a cause celebre for the global nuclear free zone movement.  The 10-year-long manipulation of the electoral process the U.S. then unleashed to force the rollback of Palau's nuclear ban became a text book case for subversion of the democratic process in developing countries...and at home.  Their experiences covering this story made the filmmakers life-long advocates of election integrity.","popularity":0.1014,"poster_path":"/qVIkXdBkRV6y0zo71Md97rl6T1f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13640,"logo_path":"/sUaed08coGdAxraWn7vAvvdRFoQ.png","name":"Corporation for Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PW","name":"Palau"}],"release_date":"1996-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Palauan Documentary","title":"Islands on the Edge of Time","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3624809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Beth Brangan","original_name":"Mary Beth Brangan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d13f7c83ee670055d0ba4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3134554,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Heddle","original_name":"James Heddle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d13f8d83ee670055d0ba59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5960348","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3MYGEkCwb0pjuGhWfwotZ0GpuaB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1532,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qVIkXdBkRV6y0zo71Md97rl6T1f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1022}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":273639,"name":"palau"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1996-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
