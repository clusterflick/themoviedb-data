Purva ļaudis","overview":"In Seda, a remote peat miners' town in Latvia, time seems to be frozen in the Soviet era. Built in 1952 and inhabited by a multi-ethnic workforce from different parts of the former USSR, it still preserves intact the inflated style of a Stalinist \"shock work\" construction project. Culturally Seda's people feel like a community apart. Their lingua franca is Russian, and their social life is a mixture of Soviet and Russian Orthodox traditions. They don't want the European Union, they want to live in their own state - the Marshland.","popularity":0.0743,"poster_path":"/yMe6OtpWorUsrAIRW177M23RFEM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41570,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmtank","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2004-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seda: People of the Marsh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaspars Goba","original_name":"Kaspars Goba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wXLmsBPD9mjfmowlReXKdw0YHDm.jpg","credit_id":"5fc6b6842fdec6003b7ad6e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaspars Goba","original_name":"Kaspars Goba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wXLmsBPD9mjfmowlReXKdw0YHDm.jpg","credit_id":"5fc6b6901b7294003f914d89","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaspars Goba","original_name":"Kaspars Goba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wXLmsBPD9mjfmowlReXKdw0YHDm.jpg","credit_id":"5fc6b69c21c4ca00401f2646","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaspars Goba","original_name":"Kaspars Goba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wXLmsBPD9mjfmowlReXKdw0YHDm.jpg","credit_id":"5fc6b6a63a340b0041e18e47","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877716,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juris Kulakovs","original_name":"Juris Kulakovs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6b6d43a340b003ee2fa1e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871102,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Raimonds Špakovskis","original_name":"Raimonds Špakovskis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6b6ec1b72940041920482","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1700475,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gunta Ikere","original_name":"Gunta Ikere","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6b70221c4ca0041203e40","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007606,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Uldis Cekulis","original_name":"Uldis Cekulis","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc6b71863536a003f2b16dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6765652","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2516,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yMe6OtpWorUsrAIRW177M23RFEM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
