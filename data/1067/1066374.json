Especially unsettling is that there's no trace of mom or her belongings in the house, prompting Lisa to confront him: \"Where is all of mom's stuff?\" And framed photos of Lisa have her crossed out with magic marker, \"bitch\" and \"whore\" scrawled over her face.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/iU2ZuZHdvriK6xViXXS1t6MZDG1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111525,"logo_path":"/q1inwlfDFAMCBcJ3MAWiYBCvYzR.png","name":"MissaX","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daddy Made a Mistake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2770761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Larimar","original_name":"Lily Larimar","popularity":9.129,"profile_path":"/lK9K3SuqoaPc6C4eMRsUaO7zUP5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63aaa11a5ad76b0094c5c8de","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":236035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan McLane","original_name":"Ryan McLane","popularity":5.656,"profile_path":"/it1oM0MPpzmd0Lsd5WlD7ZOSJDt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63aaa11fdd926a007d0d7de4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1883087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricky Greenwood","original_name":"Ricky Greenwood","popularity":2.49,"profile_path":"/14zhHXz3SgmymSlAcIgTB6YPiHr.jpg","credit_id":"63aaa130c8113d0082ba907e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":3604339,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maddy Burton","original_name":"Maddy Burton","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a3bba37a19dbc1679c0e0e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2988,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iU2ZuZHdvriK6xViXXS1t6MZDG1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1992},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qVXSqQ4dKYuzwJrDauinyIflCV3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
