He says that his wife wanted to move to the city, but he insisted on living in the village. Their children went to school in Oimura. After the divorce, the ex-wife moved to the city. Lately, Sadykov worked as a lumberjack, and went to work in Irkutsk and Ulan-Ude, because there was no work in the village. For the same reason, Sadykov advised his youngest son Vyacheslav, when he joined the army on conscription, to sign a contract and remain in military service. The last time the son came to the village to his father from the military unit for the new year 2022 to meet him together, and after that he went to the exercises in Belarus. After the start of the war on February 24, people from the military registration and enlistment office came to Sadykov's house and reported that Vyacheslav had died.","popularity":0.0615,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":106491,"logo_path":"/zfKCwR4LRaLiUdutQpAV0AeVWdS.png","name":"Radio Liberty","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father and Son","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Otets i syn","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Signs of Life","original_name":"Signs of Life","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63aa971bbe4b3600919eb143","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Signs of Life","original_name":"Signs of Life","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b18bf9875d1a007d6ea73e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
