The existential choice of, \"Should I have a cup of coffee or should I kill myself?\" serves as the driving query for filmmaker Lee Eubanks to analyze throughout the avant garde film 'Stillend'. 'Stillend' reflects Eubanks' continued interest in exploring philosophical concepts and issues through film, consistently moving between both fiction and documentary footage shot in Nairobi, Kenya. It is additionally a comment on the filmmaker's ability or inability to communicate an argument truthfully using cinematic language.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/wqd7iJX8kCR8WtGZabkdZuFGVfs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189162,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Apothetae Society","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stillend","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Feagin","original_name":"James Feagin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63aa22b89408ec00c8895a53","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nowell Zimmerman","original_name":"Nowell Zimmerman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63aa22d0a6a4c1009154573f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachael Trinidad","original_name":"Rachael Trinidad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"63aa22d8a6a4c1007df01ae5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958852,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Elizabeth James","original_name":"Elizabeth James","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"65088b79394a87011c9e33ab","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Eubanks","original_name":"Lee Eubanks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2glcdkPrScCrtSK6027OD26UiHe.jpg","credit_id":"63aa21a7aaec7100bb4f9861","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Eubanks","original_name":"Lee Eubanks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2glcdkPrScCrtSK6027OD26UiHe.jpg","credit_id":"63aa21bfeda4b700d7675d5b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846388,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Reed Deangelis","original_name":"Reed Deangelis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63aa2229aaec71008678b4c4","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Advisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958845,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"D.L.E.I.I.","original_name":"D.L.E.I.I.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63aa2261bfeb8b008d56130b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958846,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jason Crow","original_name":"Jason Crow","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63aa22129408ec008993371b","department":"Crew","job":"Digital Effects Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958846,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jason Crow","original_name":"Jason Crow","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63aa21d3b3316b00cfbd68a7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt24852452","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wqd7iJX8kCR8WtGZabkdZuFGVfs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1778},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/smpNrXNluwdmHGZfIYFloPn4of7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Experimental Forum Film Festival - Awarded 'Honorable Mention'","release_date":"2022-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Blu-ray - https://film-makerscoop.com/","release_date":"2023-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Stillend trailer","key":"785610093","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-01-01T23:04:49.000Z","id":"63b220adc56d2d00d84361fb"}]}}}
