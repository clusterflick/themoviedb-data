A recovering addict who has been sober for 25 years, Goodloe was confident that her children would grow up to be well-rounded, socially-responsible human beings. She imagined they would go to college, excel in their chosen careers and never have to worry about issues fueled by poverty, such as being on welfare, selling drugs or using food stamps. That dream, however, became a nightmare when Goodloe discovered that her troubled daughter Nafeesa had joined the Bloods, a notorious Los Angeles gang. After many sleepless nights and court appearances with her daughter, Goodloe determined that not only did she need answers to help explain how she found herself on this path with Nafeesa, but that she would take it upon herself to increase awareness about the huge numbers of girls and women involved in the gang lifestyle.","popularity":0.0473,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gang Girl: A Mother's Journey to Save Her Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerie Goodloe","original_name":"Valerie Goodloe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a9d12e15a4a1007a90e67c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2163386","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
