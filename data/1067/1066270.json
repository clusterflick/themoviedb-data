Germany's largest island with its seaside resorts from the Gründerzeit, its smaller side islands and peninsulas that give it its shape, its lagoon-like Bodden waters, the dense beech forests, the yellow rapeseed fields and the meadows, the shady tree avenues and the white sandy beaches is not only a magnet for tourists, but also a unique natural paradise in the middle of the Baltic Sea, a habitat for the rare white-tailed eagle, fallow deer, raccoon dogs and badgers as well as a resting place for huge swarms of migratory birds such as geese and cranes that can be heard trumpeting from afar. In this nature documentary, the unique landscapes and the diversity of the animal world of Rügen are captured with beautiful pictures during the changing of the seasons.","popularity":0.2711,"poster_path":"/b1MqKA8rLHtjdF4ZPZd4Udi2ZRi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162869,"logo_path":null,"name":"MB-Naturfilm","origin_country":""},{"id":18407,"logo_path":"/cI9BOAZbURxD8hrbtbB4ncwZzox.png","name":"NDR
