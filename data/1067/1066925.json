The challenges of maintaining faith and culture outside Israel, and in a society where ‘Jewish’ and ‘English’ are seen as mutually exclusive identities are perceptively explored in this astute documentary. Some secular Jews are keen to distance themselves from traditional Judaism and especially Zionism (one defines himself simply as a Marxist). Gentiles are on hand to cheerfully perpetuate some of the old stereotypes, and we’re treated to colourful snapshots of the Jewish community in London: the rag trade, a kosher butcher and restaurant.","popularity":0.5934,"poster_path":"/q4w4lInVCaVKC1SeMnt0MqToaS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some of My Best Friends...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freddie Earlle","original_name":"Freddie Earlle","popularity":0.2377,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64a194fec390c5012d16db84","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnathan Magonet","original_name":"Johnathan Magonet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64a1953ac390c5014e3cf471","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848725,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Stein","original_name":"Barbara Stein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ac82eebe4b3600828199ce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3668684,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Norman Roundell","original_name":"Norman Roundell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ac828079a1c300c4d630d5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848718,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Anthony Moore","original_name":"Anthony Moore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ac81f91f748b00a0f118fa","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Heritage","original_name":"Tom Heritage","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ac821c5ad76b00ae8f1239","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848719,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joy Lancaster","original_name":"Joy Lancaster","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ac8236c8113d00a02816bb","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Heritage","original_name":"Tom Heritage","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ac813a57530e0085ffeaef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neville Smith","original_name":"Neville Smith","popularity":0.1529,"profile_path":"/3mt7ndTt1mA4rusjyxOyYAZDZ3M.jpg","credit_id":"63ac80fd57530e00e1827e07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848721,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anthony Stern","original_name":"Anthony Stern","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ac829c7ef3811fab635aad","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848723,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rod Smith","original_name":"Rod Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ac82c979a1c300829744a2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848720,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Grace Edwards","original_name":"Grace Edwards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ac8254c8113d008ac5a24e","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":853,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q4w4lInVCaVKC1SeMnt0MqToaS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":835,"name":"jewry"},{"id":2315,"name":"jewish life"},{"id":158431,"name":"united kingdom"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Some of My Best Friends (1969) | BFI National Archive","key":"LX8cjNVRUIM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":true,"published_at":"2017-11-10T19:39:14.000Z","id":"6560d4fb706e5600e152810b"}]}}}
