Popularly known as the “lie detector,” the device transformed police work, seized headlines and was extolled in movies, TV and comics as an infallible crime-fighting tool. Husbands and wives tested each other’s fidelity. Corporations routinely tested employees’ honesty and government workers were tested for loyalty and “morals.”  But the promise of the polygraph turned dark, and the lie detector too often became an apparatus of fear and intimidation. Written and directed by Rob Rapley and executive produced by Cameo George, The Lie Detector is a tale of good intentions, twisted morals and unintended consequences.","popularity":1.1377,"poster_path":"/7M880G3pV6IH0LVH7JaqQfrOkE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13640,"logo_path":"/sUaed08coGdAxraWn7vAvvdRFoQ.png","name":"Corporation for Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Truly Unbelievable Story","title":"The Lie Detector","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andre Braugher","original_name":"Andre Braugher","popularity":1.0303,"profile_path":"/cDvAVHDiz7wyvE8K3Gxbn8zxdpo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63b3474fcb802800c4d21429","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222395,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rob Rapley","original_name":"Rob Rapley","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63abab74be4b36008281518c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2895826,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cameo George","original_name":"Cameo George","popularity":0.1853,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ababb3076ce8007d4be2f8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1394928,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Phillips","original_name":"Tom Phillips","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b75e9d24b33300931b69cf","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2409008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mischa Aletta","original_name":"Mischa Aletta","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b75ebdf44f2700bdde72fd","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3859820,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lewis Hedley-Noble","original_name":"Lewis Hedley-Noble","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b75ed643250f007c0f569b","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2995239,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kyle Kelley","original_name":"Kyle Kelley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b75ee973520500ba4c5970","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129354,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Scott Ippolito","original_name":"Scott Ippolito","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b75f0bf44f270082ca619c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3859822,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Scott David West","original_name":"Scott David West","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b75f1773520500948e64aa","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2083260,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Ramsey","original_name":"Chris Ramsey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b75f2a24b333008535d638","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1222384,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Bellows","original_name":"Susan Bellows","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b75f5c24b33300a057da66","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056220,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Omry Maoz","original_name":"Omry Maoz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b75f8e93bd6900a06237cb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222395,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rob Rapley","original_name":"Rob Rapley","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b75fa4f44f2700bdde732e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2074783,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emily L.
