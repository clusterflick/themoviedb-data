The series is focused on infusing environments of motion and time inherent in cinema with traditional visual art themes. 'Volume 1' involves six scenes which each showcase a different genre of photography or painting interpreted through cinematic movement and duration. Each scene is comprised of a single stationary shot reaching the 30-second maximum shot length of the hand-wound Krasnogorsk-3 camera. While 'Motion Pictures for Wall Frames' can be screened through traditional cinematic formats, the project is designed to be shown framed on a wall, either through projection or digital picture screen, much like a framed photograph or canvas. This concept originated from Eubanks' desire to see works of cinema showcased similarly to how pictures and paintings are commonly displayed across the world.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/kk2wSXmRD7OGVtmg9H339PewV25.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189162,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Apothetae Society","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motion Pictures for Wall Frames: Volume 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Feagin","original_name":"James Feagin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63aa1d7507216600a217cf2a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958852,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Elizabeth James","original_name":"Elizabeth James","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65088bee394a8700ada86c62","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Eubanks","original_name":"Lee Eubanks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2glcdkPrScCrtSK6027OD26UiHe.jpg","credit_id":"63aa1d95eda4b700d7675c74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18748200","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kk2wSXmRD7OGVtmg9H339PewV25.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"MoMA Rio gallery installation","release_date":"2019-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
