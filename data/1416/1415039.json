Although it had been weeks since her husband died, Ah-bu (mother) painfully grieves as she continuously does daily chores she had done for him when he was alive. She would often sit by the window imagining, or even hoping for, his return. One day, in her bedroom, she realizes that she had begun to forget who she is. Worried that she would completely forget herself, this prompts Ah-bu to fight for whatever is left of her identity on her own.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fbQgzpHjuWCOUWS0hJh0NkZ2KBQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Day, Three Autumns","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5169382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bridget Rabo Ng-Ting","original_name":"Bridget Rabo Ng-Ting","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67802c40ee84fa4def7af5ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fbQgzpHjuWCOUWS0hJh0NkZ2KBQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1734}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
