Even a casual observer can't help but notice how structural racism is ignored, how multiculturalism is confused with equality, and how many campuses remain hamstrung in their efforts to become more inclusive and welcoming of everyone. Ironically, in responding to surveys, many students claim they already know all they need to know about diversity and they shy away from opportunities to engage in interracial dialogue and understanding.  WHAT'S RACE GOT TO DO WITH IT? is a new documentary film that goes beyond identity politics, celebratory history and interpersonal relations to consider social disparities and their impact on student success in today's post-Civil Rights world.","popularity":0.0679,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What's Race Got to Do with It?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5169604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Belinda Sullivan","original_name":"Belinda Sullivan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67805124c5d2e96e267b2503","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5169589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cheng","original_name":"Jean Cheng","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67804fc2a6778aa5b37b4bd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5169589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cheng","original_name":"Jean Cheng","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67804fce601acfe7bd4ea904","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5169589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cheng","original_name":"Jean Cheng","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67804fd9c5d2e96e267b249f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495768,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gail Mallimson","original_name":"Gail Mallimson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67804fe8c5d2e96e267b24c5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4284875,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dan Krauss","original_name":"Dan Krauss","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678050131431e0591abb13dc","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5169590,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jung Do (Kim) Choi","original_name":"Jung Do (Kim) Choi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6780503612667968854eb589","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5169591,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brent MacDonald","original_name":"Brent MacDonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67805056044b6ca6764ea669","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":996817,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vicente Franco","original_name":"Vicente Franco","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6780506d601acfe7bd4ea931","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2242632,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Donavan Sell","original_name":"Donavan Sell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6780509c601acfe7bd4ea947","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5169595,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Jason Gilbertson","original_name":"Jason Gilbertson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678050a9ed679e53f87b133e","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649999,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"B.
