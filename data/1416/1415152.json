This fantasy genre film pays homage to The Wizard of Oz, with an oceanic mythic savor. The story is set in contemporary beach culture of Southern California. Elena escapes the troubles of her home life by retreating to the solitude of the ocean, where she surfs away her pain. When her parents divorce and her father moves out, Elena unconsciously projects onto her boyfriend, Evan, the negative feelings she develops for her father. In an intense surf session Elena has a wipe-out, gets hit on the head with her board and knocked unconscious. She gets pulled underwater, and when she surfaces, finds herself in a dali-esque mythical realm where she sets out on a quest to find what she has lost. Lani, a mermaid guides her to find herself and face the Sea-serpent of the cave.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/65sib4BvmHscm6F87DaHAnrZqe5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A broken home sends Elena on a fanta-sea journey where she discovers that TO LIVE IS TO LOVE.","title":"Breakwater","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0404830","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":754,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/65sib4BvmHscm6F87DaHAnrZqe5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
