The film lacks a traditional narrator, instead giving us interviews with loggers taped in the field or their homes. To help us visualize the words of the loggers, Finne edits them together with shots of the Northwestern wilderness, both in Oregon and Washington. Also featured is old footage and photographs of loggers, stunts and jokes of the loggers.","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":"/owInsOFEXQPEO2c7osLdOnwyJOk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Natural Timber Country","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1969810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Finne","original_name":"Ron Finne","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67810da50690ac06e77af447","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5170550,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Hauser","original_name":"Gary Hauser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67810e11ee84fa4def7b0de9","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":839,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/owInsOFEXQPEO2c7osLdOnwyJOk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":559}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Screening at Portland Art Museum","release_date":"1972-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
