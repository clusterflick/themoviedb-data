She lives in Downtown Los Angeles, in the Bunker Hill area and witnesses the transformations of the place over the years. From Molly's story the project zooms out and excavates the history and legends about the area of Los Angeles, building on a rich collection of archival materials, interviews, and re-photography. Navigating through this database the viewer can trace the events, people and places Molly never noticed, engaging with the ethnically complex reality of the area and its fictionalization in countless Hollywood movies. Bleeding Through - Layers of Los Angeles is an allegory of the process in which memory emerges as a distorted hybrid produced by historic documents, personal recollection, and imagination.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/67KrRe3bLu3xopewp1SjYB74D0F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114055,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZKM Karlsruhe","origin_country":""},{"id":249810,"logo_path":null,"name":"Labyrinth Project","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bleeding Through: Layers of Los Angeles 1920-1986","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman M.
