A band by many considered to be the best live act from the low-lands and beyond. The show took place in the 013 venue in Tilburg, a town in the southern part of the Netherlands. The gig was a sell-out and we feel touched by a lucky star because this, already legendary, show has been recorded for prosperity in vision and audio. Above all DEDICAT10N is about Julian Sasâ€™ dedication to his music. He plays, talks, thinks and breathes music. Always with passion. Always with devotion and maximum effort. Music is his life.","popularity":0.1557,"poster_path":"/2kroQFzTjIrqm4yuqMzSJRNB86t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249700,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ed Bos","origin_country":""},{"id":249701,"logo_path":null,"name":"Julian Sas","origin_country":""},{"id":249702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corasong Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This man can play the blues.
