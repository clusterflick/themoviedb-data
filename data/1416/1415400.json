During the filmmaker’s imaginary conversations with her late grand aunt, she tells the story of B and S. As she starts, B and S appear, sharing their memories, negotiating the meaning of transness, love, loss, friendship and violence. A teak tree and a little parrot help Darai intertwine these narratives. The result is a personal, warm and heartfelt ode to friendship, and to building a different kind of home.","popularity":0.2541,"poster_path":"/g1xSjluu0uKpwD51xvyoLPUHGTO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Oriya","iso_639_1":"or","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"B and S","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lipika Singh Darai","original_name":"Lipika Singh Darai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67811cb5ed679e53f87b2af4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g1xSjluu0uKpwD51xvyoLPUHGTO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2025-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
