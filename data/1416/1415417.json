If the premise is sad, director Quentin Papapietro manages to build a comedy in which the feeling of heartwarming fatherly love is staged with intelligence, and a great sense of cinema. With humour and a hint of absurdity, Père et fille offers a new way to consider family films.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father and Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2243998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quentin Papapietro","original_name":"Quentin Papapietro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/2T7dwZNoiaNxkewoWd3Li3LZkC6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67812aea2b29a918d04e7edf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1663109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Tuillier","original_name":"Laura Tuillier","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/oWFcjzRdxGtyYznD0VcG9KxUsK4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67812af5ee84fa4def7b1140","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4282432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Lemarchand","original_name":"Paul Lemarchand","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67812b042b29a918d04e7efa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascale Bodet","original_name":"Pascale Bodet","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/vYZO6ZAqu85pJB0JnDEU1cgb9YB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67812b0e2b29a918d04e7f02","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2243998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quentin Papapietro","original_name":"Quentin Papapietro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/2T7dwZNoiaNxkewoWd3Li3LZkC6.jpg","credit_id":"67812ab4c5d2e96e267b418d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2025-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
