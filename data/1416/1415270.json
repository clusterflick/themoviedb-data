Her goal, in a sense, is: to disappear. Filmmaker Oskar Weimar accompanies her patiently, in calm shots that are first reminiscent of still lifes, then of observational cinema – while he himself ghosts through the shots as a white homeowner. Weimar and his collaborators infuse this woman’s mysterious act of defiance with a deep emotional life, portraying a group, a present, a moment in history through the act of an individual. Here, an unsentimental turning away from the world makes for a light-footed turn towards cinema. A film that sits somewhere between meditation, transformation and dance formation.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Want To Be A House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2933641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Weimar","original_name":"Oskar Weimar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6780c78ca6778aa5b37b5a8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2933641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Weimar","original_name":"Oskar Weimar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6780c79212667968854ec18f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2933641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Weimar","original_name":"Oskar Weimar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6780c79a1431e0591abb23a9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin Critics Week","release_date":"2025-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
