Every child dreams of playing in the “big leagues,” and nearly every adult knows someone who has. However, as the nation's passion for baseball flourishes, its natural environment is under threat from rapid development. Essential mangroves, which provide vital ecological benefits, are being destroyed to make way for new infrastructure. Despite this, there is hope. A new initiative aims to ignite a nationwide passion for environmental conservation through the country’s love for baseball. Meet Ismael Diaz-Tolentino, a native-born Dominican and ecologist who serves as the Mangroves & Sports Program Coordinator for Seacology, a US-based non-profit. Ismael leads the Play for the Mangroves initiative, a nationwide program in the Dominican Republic that combines mangrove conservation with baseball.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aTCyHuK5eYrQRGZEII66uwxJ0SJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249794,"logo_path":null,"name":"11th Hour Racing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Operation Restoration: Roots","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5171496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danny Schmidt","original_name":"Danny Schmidt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6781987c6056586f6c4e59c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5171498,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Corinna Halloran","original_name":"Corinna Halloran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678198963881c79419bb7e98","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5171499,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lauren Todd","original_name":"Lauren Todd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678198ab912cb27280bb5071","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTCyHuK5eYrQRGZEII66uwxJ0SJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
