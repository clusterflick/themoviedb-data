Upon her arrival, Jacob falls in love almost instantly, a feeling he had never felt before. Being short for his age and lacking self-confidence, he chooses to hide his emotions towards her, fearing that she will learn it and never want to talk to him again. Throughout his last two years in elementary school, Jacob is confronted by the constant defeat of his alley's hockey team, the rivalry between him and his classmates, and of course by the fear of sharing his feelings for Ariane, his neighbor.","popularity":0.0828,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":233101,"logo_path":"/odu6JaTMeif4s0LLyFpgKXv51lS.png","name":"David Robitaille Studios","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"DRS ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE","title":"Flamme Silencieuse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4813280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Robitaille","original_name":"David Robitaille","popularity":0.133,"profile_path":"/afbqXtEo1sfx5XSEO523oedZTcQ.jpg","credit_id":"67e48b8af846794e99109009","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4813280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Robitaille","original_name":"David Robitaille","popularity":0.133,"profile_path":"/afbqXtEo1sfx5XSEO523oedZTcQ.jpg","credit_id":"67e48ed6e8a1910e65108e02","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
