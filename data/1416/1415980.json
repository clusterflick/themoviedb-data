The walk of a young Guinean boy arrived in France at the end of 2016. His voice, his words have something in common with some of the Scriptures’ verses. They dialogue through the silent body of a woman who grieves a biblical and contemporary loss. On the ground and on the wall, a luminous print of a virtual space: a window crossed by a beam of sunlight. Considered a physical phenomenon as much as a metaphysical concern, this rectangle of light contradicts the properties of a functional lighting, causing a limited and partial coincidence between light and sculpture.","popularity":0.0779,"poster_path":"/qvUfeY5Au3ZpkVTJxKe1wVu0GSv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Estran","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5172576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lamine
