Through interviews and conversations with seven Italian Black Queer individuals, the project creates a safe space to share their stories. It aims to both celebrate the beauty and resilience of the Black Queer Italian experience and shed light on the racism, queerphobia, homophobia, and transphobia that often overshadow it.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Queer Black Italian Experience","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5169427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Anderson","original_name":"Jordan Anderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6780385b218fd57acf4e982c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
