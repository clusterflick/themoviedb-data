My mother did not want children.  She wanted to free herself from domestic contingencies.  She became a civil servant and a city dweller.  All my life, I had to deal with this aversion that she transmitted to me.  Having chosen to live in the countryside, I find myself in my turn monopolized by my home.  It is from my kitchen and my computer screen that I reconstruct our women's journeys under the influence of household and family obligations.  My grandmother carried buckets of water with a yoke every day.  Today my friends are coming back to washable diapers.  I summon people, places and archives to question my intimate history by dialoguing with Michelle Perrot, historian of women's emancipation.","popularity":0.172,"poster_path":"/tom4xBwcyKsBblQXq4jTkG0YZzw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Airelles Vidéo","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":76613,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Vif Cinémas","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Femme de mère en fille","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2698215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valérie Guillaudot","original_name":"Valérie Guillaudot","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6407149f12b10e00ff5e40aa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3034797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magali Chapelan","original_name":"Magali Chapelan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640714aaf85958010a8b503f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952866,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Paul Raffit","original_name":"Jean-Paul Raffit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64071475f8595800d38327a5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952867,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hélène Lioult","original_name":"Hélène Lioult","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640714927a4ee700ba59a3f3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952868,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Glawdys Déprez","original_name":"Glawdys Déprez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640714c19715ae008264dc47","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2698215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valérie Guillaudot","original_name":"Valérie Guillaudot","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6407147d12b10e007ca5d528","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2583253,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gertrude Baillot","original_name":"Gertrude Baillot","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640714d59715ae009ae99bf2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952867,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hélène Lioult","original_name":"Hélène Lioult","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640714e2f8595800d38327d7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2698215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valérie Guillaudot","original_name":"Valérie Guillaudot","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efcafe2a284eb003690c3de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26774486","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1314,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tom4xBwcyKsBblQXq4jTkG0YZzw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":876}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
