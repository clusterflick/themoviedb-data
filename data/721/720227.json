She attends the funeral only to encounter his younger lover and then finds out that her children might have kept in touch with her late husband secretly behind her back.  Director Joseph Chen-Chieh Hsu said that the story is based on his grandmother, who was forced to raise eight kids by herself after her husband ran away. The student short film was shot in his home country of Taiwan. Selected as a 2017 Student Academy Awards Finalist, the short also appeared in the 2018 Asian American International Film Festival. It’s the first time that lead actress Shu-Fang has sung in a film in over 40 years.","popularity":0.0935,"poster_path":"/sz7kxuubyKcqDcum9dniskUgAeo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2018-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guo Mie","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"孤味(短片版)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1609496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Chen Shu-Fang","original_name":"陳淑芳","popularity":0.3204,"profile_path":"/b6HFWVa7UwexYgFIXGmTnPdiYcz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sho-Ying","credit_id":"5efafbcc5437f500368dcf20","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2692022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"True Wang","original_name":"王真琳","popularity":0.1731,"profile_path":"/7mUS6MNv2ZiezEkjbOfbIoxukcP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Chen","credit_id":"610295d0f706de007e901c09","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1715264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fang Wen-Lin","original_name":"方文琳","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/lqLe3nr6XMNNVZLW8ehgbKGV9lU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Aunt Tsai","credit_id":"5efafbebf0317400364eacc4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2559079,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Chen-Chieh Hsu","original_name":"Joseph Chen-Chieh Hsu","popularity":0.0675,"profile_path":"/yOZ4I5gJJWkJrueDd631xT9pEGi.jpg","credit_id":"5efafbb1c5840d00350f2cf0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2559079,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Chen-Chieh Hsu","original_name":"Joseph Chen-Chieh Hsu","popularity":0.0675,"profile_path":"/yOZ4I5gJJWkJrueDd631xT9pEGi.jpg","credit_id":"5efafbbc55b0c00037165c96","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6739124","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"guomiethefilm","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qJvE0gjuIuRAfCkElKV9zFFetpR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sz7kxuubyKcqDcum9dniskUgAeo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"普遍級","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Chinese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Mandarin\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"zh\", \"native_name\"=>\"Chinese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
