These crucial years of his life spent in Los Angeles have forever shaped his persona and created a strong identity crisis within him. He decides to deal with his past by embarking in a journey across the United States during the 40 days prior to America's most crucial and heartfelt elections: Obama vs McCain. Change is an inside look at the political rallies, the concerts, the events, the controversies, the hopes and fears of a struggling country through the lens of a man looking to find himself and the country that raised him.","popularity":0.2004,"poster_path":"/4CHYp0WjIsjF0QOVVvHFLTYOcgO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136539,"logo_path":null,"name":"Feel
