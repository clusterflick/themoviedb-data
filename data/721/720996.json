Cartoons illustrate: normal cell function in the body; the appearance and growth of neoplastic cells and their destruction of normal cells; cure of cancer by surgery, radiation therapy, and radium implants; spread of untreated cancer through the lymphatic system to the circulatory system; and the danger signals that indicate that cancer is present, e.g. any sore that does not heal, irregular bleeding or discharge from any natural body orifice, progressive change in any wart, mole, or birthmark, persistent indigestion, hoarseness, persistent cough, difficult swallowing, or any change in normal bowel habits. A pathologist is shown examining tissue under a microscope.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13410,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Sutherland Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Traitor Within","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Gordon","original_name":"George Gordon","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efdc178a76ac50036fd809f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4335856","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
