At the subsequent Tribunal of Inquiry, Lord Chief Justice Widgery exonerated the soldiers and blighted the reputation of those who were killed and wounded. In 1998 a new Tribunal of Inquiry was announced into the day that has become known as \"Bloody Sunday\". This documentary follows the course of the Inquiry from the point of view of the families of the victims, as they travelled between Derry and London over a five year period.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/t7zamX5bB7S5lNWADUyg7VnAHTQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144600,"logo_path":null,"name":"Besom Productions","origin_country":"XI"},{"id":16975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lichtblick Film- und Fernsehproduktion (I)","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÉ","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XI","name":"Northern Ireland"}],"release_date":"2006-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bloody Sunday: A Derry Diary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Dimanche sanglant, plaie d'Irlande","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Blutiger Sonntag","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792946,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margo Harkin","original_name":"Margo Harkin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efcf8c577c01f00360e42c2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792946,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margo Harkin","original_name":"Margo Harkin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efcf8b0a284eb003690e870","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0938609","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lLGojNVP73E1zAbTlT3Xb2ITTIk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":569},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t7zamX5bB7S5lNWADUyg7VnAHTQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7005,"name":"northern ireland"},{"id":318459,"name":"bloody sunday"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ZDF","release_date":"2007-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2007-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RTÉ 1","release_date":"2007-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Northern Ireland Film Festival","release_date":"2009-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
