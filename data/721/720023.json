He recruited a group of elite Irish rowers and set his sights on qualifying the team for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Having achieved qualification for the games, the stage was set for an historic Olympic debut. But one thing stood in their way; the Olympic Council of Ireland.  Despite qualifying for the games, the OCI refused to allow them to compete at the games in Calgary, which saw the famous Jamaican bobsleigh team become Olympic heroes. Undeterred, the team evolved and set their sights on the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France.","popularity":0.1472,"poster_path":"/cFdoCTiIdwweXDZkRdB8LYIV0cK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137700,"logo_path":null,"name":"Liberty
