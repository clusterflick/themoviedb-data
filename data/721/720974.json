The tiger scares the mice at first, but really has no interest in them, so the mice have fun with the bear, painting a glow-in-the-dark mouse on its bottom for the tiger to attack and leading the tiger on a house-wrecking chase with a steak. The tiger ends up hanging out and smoking cigars with the mice.","popularity":0.0726,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snap Happy Traps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Nelson","original_name":"Dick Nelson","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bear (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5efda2117b7b4d00355a0068","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":785866,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cal Howard","original_name":"Cal Howard","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bear","credit_id":"66e6af21050f14e4fccf6aad","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":555757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Wickersham","original_name":"Bob Wickersham","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efda1f4f031740039520e42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0152488","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
