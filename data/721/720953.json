The Medicine reveals the hidden mysteries of one of nature's most powerful and controversial healing remedies- Ayahuasca. It is a documentary about Amazonian shamanism, introducing Taita Juanito Guerilmo Chindoy Chindoy, both a teacher and student of the sacred plant medicine. As Ayahuasca gains popularity in the West, the film explores the science as well as the lore behind the plant and why it is used to heal. It follows former NFL Safety, Kerry Rhodes, and actress, AnnaLynne McCord, as they drink with the Taita experiencing Ayahuasca for the first time- in its true tradition. Humanity faces an unprecedented rise in addiction, insecurity and disease- perhaps the cure does lie within the arms of Mother Nature.","popularity":0.6935,"poster_path":"/9vpd96hqG7Nwesyqm3Bg2l7FTrI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can an ancient Amazonian plant medicine help heal mankind?","title":"Medicamentele străvechi","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kerry Rhodes","original_name":"Kerry Rhodes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qGl6xhf3eogt3dXwEAk6CYUQyxB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5efd8554a284eb003899fdb5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"AnnaLynne McCord","original_name":"AnnaLynne McCord","popularity":0.7561,"profile_path":"/1clytn2mrOWvbUQOvVNJb32v7P.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5efd85725437f5003692b63c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Hancock","original_name":"Graham Hancock","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/cwiVURNAlapWcx4mJxUWtGGNZiN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5efd8580a284eb00379333aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2698849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taita Juanito Guillermo Chindoy Chindoy","original_name":"Taita Juanito Guillermo Chindoy Chindoy","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5efd858c5437f5003692b66c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Townsend","original_name":"Stuart Townsend","popularity":0.8436,"profile_path":"/8jc2nlrAkinMjyVPvYxa9goL5QZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5efd859cf03174003951e114","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2698854,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shawn Tavassoli","original_name":"Shawn Tavassoli","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efd85e57b7b4d003559c445","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2698855,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tim Hafer","original_name":"Tim Hafer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efd85f8f03174003951e181","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335301,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Farzin Toussi","original_name":"Farzin Toussi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efd85adf0317400365371a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colet Abedi","original_name":"Colet Abedi","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efd85ba7b7b4d0037578f84","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2698853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Moghadas","original_name":"Ali Moghadas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efd85d0a284eb0036915f54","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8693390","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1A5evrRmKjjI0mfyWJddRfpwCFt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":1092,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rjI0LrJxgNX6NprpfShP7Fp9mHB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9vpd96hqG7Nwesyqm3Bg2l7FTrI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"The Medicine\" Documentary 60 Second Trailer","key":"6bhZAvMXugQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-08-05T22:28:23.000Z","id":"5efd8616be7f350033aba091"}]}}}
