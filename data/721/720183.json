Since he can't find inspiration, he decides to accompany her on her work day to other houses. Thus, delving into other people's lives, both begin to stop seeing each other as strangers and have fun, momentarily forgetting their own problems for a while. Without romantic tensions, the two simply enjoy sharing the day and, while Ángela cannot stop remembering Pedro, her dead husband, he only listens. Without advice or sermons, their two visions come together to make, at least that day, a different experience.","popularity":0.2493,"poster_path":"/ftOw1XqKbahDAhquzxImScMcUQ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6458,"logo_path":"/eT4oMUK7ODM0vvZue8yq3Ojwqf8.png","name":"INCAA","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":11999,"logo_path":"/50K9W66YeWjOalNcjWddPcSgIYO.png","name":"Universidad
