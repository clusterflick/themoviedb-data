A philosopher, a dreamer, a self-appointed chieftain, a failed playwright, he proclaims the virtue of being a minority voice. He wants to rise above the elitism associated with the game of golf, so he builds a golf course in a bog! John has further plans to entice tourists to keep the islands alive. Can he realise his new plan or is it too radical?  A Maverick Islander is a different kind of film from activist performer and filmmaker Margaretta D’Arcy, now in her 87th year and part of a gang of two other mavericks Laurie Allen and Finn Arden, and a member of Aosdána.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Maverick Islander","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2695865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margarette D'Arcy","original_name":"Margarette D'Arcy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef9e189cffeed003604ea7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12600180","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
