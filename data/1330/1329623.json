We follow Avery, the estranged daughter of the deceased, who is slowly suffocated by her dysfunctional family at the viewing of her father’s body. Her patience wears thin as her family members continue to make the day about themselves. Eroded with guilt over her father’s last attempt at connection before his suicide, Avery reaches a breaking point which blows the lid off the family’s repressed grief. GOOD GRIEF is a fast paced, overwhelming, emotional portrait of collective grief and the bizarre ways in which we cope.","popularity":0.4925,"poster_path":"/mq4hmEnE4RX7ovwdZshlquvqXGe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195257,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jevita Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Grief","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Missy Yager","original_name":"Missy Yager","popularity":0.3389,"profile_path":"/8rPPzf7z52VjFGPMn2MilwQFRy5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tara","credit_id":"67e83177b5655aac4263951b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Crawford","original_name":"Ellen Crawford","popularity":0.2878,"profile_path":"/hp7h2dP4F1wrdYyrMD3aFiMCcrE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gigi","credit_id":"67e831b8a3d8cc928e67d76c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":948762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Cackowski","original_name":"Craig Cackowski","popularity":0.4001,"profile_path":"/pomSoRjZJvWyWz4wKvC0sKiErYV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marty","credit_id":"67e831f76214525cd5638bce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3106475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dash McCloud","original_name":"Dash McCloud","popularity":0.4208,"profile_path":"/8WmRoUrM5S7rA0TVSdKGOSh9uq8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Elvis","credit_id":"67e832336b367d469567cc88","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1451919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garrett Coffey","original_name":"Garrett Coffey","popularity":0.1937,"profile_path":"/yLyt2IWASPiUgcmMf4lq9NZawrN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"67e8328bf1f5376875ddc831","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2598023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Lamadrid","original_name":"Anna Lamadrid","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/rmooWeauKRa7IEFEOPoDIWaVzss.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pennae","credit_id":"67e832c3a3d8cc928e67d7bc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2118970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Wade","original_name":"Tom Wade","popularity":0.0999,"profile_path":"/3ga02Wz6cB5tVX0MqfvxM4wXBVR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"David","credit_id":"67e833acf1f5376875ddc894","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2618473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Brunner","original_name":"Rachel Brunner","popularity":0.0628,"profile_path":"/6Q0D1w7l2WnhDw7IJxCsCJwAPly.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Avery","credit_id":"67e833e3f1f5376875ddc8ae","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2591160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janna Cardia","original_name":"Janna Cardia","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/2ef3SbD2C91Ji5YMrz9xWNfZp7S.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Kaleena","credit_id":"67e834175f93a9fd25ddbb7f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3176858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Megan Chumbley","original_name":"Megan Chumbley","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bc4704a14c7df7dae1dd48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2618473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Brunner","original_name":"Rachel Brunner","popularity":0.0628,"profile_path":"/6Q0D1w7l2WnhDw7IJxCsCJwAPly.jpg","credit_id":"67e834376b367d469567cce8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28546630","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mq4hmEnE4RX7ovwdZshlquvqXGe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
