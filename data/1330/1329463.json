But less than half of them will receive the precious gift that could save them from a predicted death. Why is this so? A number of ethical, bureaucratic, medical and human obstacles stand in the way of organ donation. The documentary aims to illustrate them, and to take us right to the beginning of the chain, with the donors, their families and the hospital staff who accompany them through these painful moments.","popularity":0.0437,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"DON D'ORGANES: LA VIE CONTINUE","title":"Don d'organes, la vie continue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
