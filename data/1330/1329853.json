A last-minute deal was struck, narrowly averting the deployment of martial law forces and a potential bloodbath. Nevertheless, the conflict resulted in numerous casualties. Even now, more than four decades later, the scars of this event remain deeply etched in the community's collective memory.","popularity":0.1048,"poster_path":"/nvQih6pvbPygi7J377yG0xNEvPr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2024-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1980 Sabuk","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"1980사북","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Bong-nam","original_name":"Park Bong-nam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bcc66e5bf68c090a9b53cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":906,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/nvQih6pvbPygi7J377yG0xNEvPr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":640},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/s6ubTOD80ordaSCoUlO4uVZMXr6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
