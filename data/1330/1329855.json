It addresses the universal questions of our roots, our history, that of our family, the bond that unites and sometimes separates. How can we build ourselves and what can we pass on to our children when part of our past is unknown to us? This film is the story of the passing of the baton from a mother with her baggage as a Korean adoptee, to her teenage daughter, at a time when identity construction is at its peak, a pivotal and delicate period of breaking with childhood.","popularity":0.0645,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything That Connects Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathy Ming-Jung","original_name":"Jung","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bcc6bbbabeacf2fda45dab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathy Ming-Jung","original_name":"Jung","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674284ff25b9d8bcdfbd5c49","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathy Ming-Jung","original_name":"Jung","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67428505f3f291912e953411","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5240803,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laëtitia Marty","original_name":"Laëtitia Marty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ab872b9d346d3ef49bb54e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathy Ming-Jung","original_name":"Jung","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ab87e409b8551a04b0a9a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ALL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
