Dubbing them \"Flower Cows,\" they garner support through public donations, livestock farmers, and local activists, managing to temporarily shelter six of the cows at a ranch in Inje County. In their quest for a permanent home, the activists work to bridge the generational divide with the elderly residents of Sinwol Village in Inje County. Together, they embark on an ambitious project to build a cow sanctuary. Their collaborative efforts culminate in the establishment of Korea's first cow sanctuary, repurposing a closed school in Sinwol.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":"/2u82AqpzqLLoHCbxWCY9Brcy88r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2024-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flower Cow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4885786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leem Joong-wan","original_name":"Leem Joong-wan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bcc706efa268dff1e99488","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2u82AqpzqLLoHCbxWCY9Brcy88r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ALL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
