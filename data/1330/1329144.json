Miraculously, he saved every handwritten script. Now, four decades later, some of the biggest names in comedy will come together to perform a 60-minute reading of a self-contained story arc that found six of Beverly Hills’ most popular characters travelling overseas for a life-or-death adventure. Although some of Teenage Michael's atrocious spelling has been cleaned up for this theatrical experience, the scenes will be performed exactly as they were written nearly 40 years ago. For better or worse.","popularity":1.8003,"poster_path":"/hEVcRoDC3rONQRC88sO76hSfjtG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beverly Hills","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":161932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Rash","original_name":"Jim Rash","popularity":0.6316,"profile_path":"/cXat9HZ5ajQZsrAZ8xE4zIEVEcb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lloyd Kramer","credit_id":"66bb1d7684db39e3e63f10fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1220767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Fumero","original_name":"Melissa Fumero","popularity":1.0474,"profile_path":"/x4LpHhitsPjlyTLoDTDTm55OnHZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tiffany Vincent","credit_id":"66bb1db0aebcad821664a7bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dulé Hill","original_name":"Dulé Hill","popularity":1.1757,"profile_path":"/fPJ8lIx6WwBgO2AhnHQSeiZiAUy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Craig Vincent","credit_id":"66bb1dd98fc8d73d5d1a71cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gillian Jacobs","original_name":"Gillian Jacobs","popularity":1.1461,"profile_path":"/sbZVI3F2t5CjmRANwHk3X6iOQpt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cindy Tyler","credit_id":"66bb1df72fb84df78e914794","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Hale","original_name":"Tony Hale","popularity":1.4237,"profile_path":"/ar4uapp4w5wMkThZcqWUNMSTO8z.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rob Jones","credit_id":"66bb1e1d464930a2fb3f16ac","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Ausiello","original_name":"Michael Ausiello","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bb1e33382fc34d66ab003b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hEVcRoDC3rONQRC88sO76hSfjtG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
