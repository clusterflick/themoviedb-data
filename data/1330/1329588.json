When she plans a party for them at home, they phone from the school that they cannot come because they are too busy. But she hears the sounds of a party in the background, so she goes to the school where she finds her daughters with young men. She is told that two of the daughters plan to be married, while the third plans to marry Grantland Dobbs as soon as he gets a divorce, and the mother is frightened by this announcement. She goes abroad and returns with a man, gets an apartment at a wealthy center, and lives with him. Her daughters are shocked when the mother entertains guests at drinking parties. When Mrs. Manners proves to her daughters that their fianc√©es are not respectable, she reveals to them that she was acting a part just to prove to them that she was right about their chosen mates. She reveals that the man she was living with was her cousin.","popularity":0.1995,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"FLOWERS GAIETY AND FORGETFULNESS WINGS of YOUTH (AND HOW THEY WERE CLIPPED) See them begin to flutter.","title":"Wings of Youth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1275688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Clayton","original_name":"Ethel Clayton","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":"/pEKusLCieVqAOEfRB2CXAtibTeZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Katherine Manners","credit_id":"66bc234a58d7706ec72d59e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madge Bellamy","original_name":"Madge Bellamy","popularity":0.2701,"profile_path":"/wiUNtLSEuorsYdhWAzct1W5nIB3.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Madelyne Manners / Angela Du Bois","credit_id":"66bc2360bdeaf76d1ee10d34","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1231648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Farrell","original_name":"Charles Farrell","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":"/5fhrR7vCYtlyJQxnhNPscwFxfgT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ted Spaulding","credit_id":"66bc236e360d0655eba454de","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freeman Wood","original_name":"Freeman Wood","popularity":0.1305,"profile_path":"/ngwL8sW1vOpUqEfx5oJQ5CzvTVx.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Lucien Angoola","credit_id":"66bc2382fb08b8ab62825240","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Cain","original_name":"Robert Cain","popularity":0.0787,"profile_path":"/aBGtUfw3WZo0iF0y5EaYCoIIpz2.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Pierre Du Bois / Marcus Jones","credit_id":"66bc2397af6531eb748c7b33","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1374228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Perry","original_name":"Katherine Perry","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/62D7gyckQ6HXvdckQ3OdqGqB6oi.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Gwen Manners","credit_id":"66bc23a69ec961dc1dc34cfa","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1783784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Harlan","original_name":"Marion Harlan","popularity":0.0889,"profile_path":"/sVi0A2E7Mez9CEHCiIzcT2AVJjT.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Betty Manners","credit_id":"66bc23bc1047a9a6900ad987","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1443696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Stewart","original_name":"George Stewart","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/4nnFJ2KxttO5G1F6aZwHU9cLMGr.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Jimmie Dale","credit_id":"66bc23ecc2fddd06c28254bb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Gerrard","original_name":"Douglas Gerrard","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/8B2FwROI0bmfKpcsWlv5WPpxywe.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Grantland Dobbs","credit_id":"66bc23fe29004844dbe1d922","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4884564,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harold P.
