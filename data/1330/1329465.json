Set in 2150, 60 years after humans leave the planet, the video follows an arctic tern’s flight path over a landscape of wreckage, beauty, and decay. The bird narrates the events leading up to humanity’s departure while drawing floating, polyphonic speculations between larger themes such as water and capitalism. This video was produced for ‘DAY ZERO’, an exhibition at the Palace of Running Waters, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and will be presented at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Fort Worth, Texas, US, in 2023.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Earthseed 2150","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
