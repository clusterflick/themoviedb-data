During his journey west, Robert meets Mary Hamilton, a stranded actress from a roadshow company of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Because Mary is still in costume as the character, “Little Eva,” Robert mistakes her for a child and takes her with him to the ranch. He ultimately discovers the identity of the arms smugglers and, with the help of the Mexican Rurales, brings the gang to justice. Robert then realizes that Mary is not a child and wins her for his wife.","popularity":0.2379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":106314,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phil Goldstone Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":236316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Truart Film Corp.","origin_country":""},{"id":8664,"logo_path":null,"name":"Renown Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Reckless Sex","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madge Bellamy","original_name":"Madge Bellamy","popularity":0.2701,"profile_path":"/wiUNtLSEuorsYdhWAzct1W5nIB3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mary Hamilton","credit_id":"66bb9b02942a502e570e663a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Collier Jr.","original_name":"William Collier Jr.","popularity":0.1967,"profile_path":"/zgFHpJl1Tor0AVVXq9QOV4L14SF.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Juan","credit_id":"66bb9defb149f8660b8c5cff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":540363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wyndham Standing","original_name":"Wyndham Standing","popularity":0.172,"profile_path":"/3J3ynqFyS6jkEKKs5TkCPKstfjm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Carter Trevor","credit_id":"66bba102f971876e0d0abf23","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire McDowell","original_name":"Claire McDowell","popularity":0.4763,"profile_path":"/lITEhC4pY2UiqmItzQMBnexxcMU.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Concha","credit_id":"66bba130ae6f15671f0f1d54","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnnie Walker","original_name":"Johnnie Walker","popularity":0.1374,"profile_path":"/6vAT7pUMl6W7UXYAy2E9AegW09G.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Robert Lanning, Jr.","credit_id":"66bba1580fb31aa39a0f1d53","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude Astor","original_name":"Gertrude Astor","popularity":0.33,"profile_path":"/jjIoqFS6mmfZFlhX8pcBhPVzIBJ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Lucile Dupré","credit_id":"66bba1a8f19eb99957823918","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alec B.
