It highlights the phase of doubt he experienced intellectually before ultimately resolving it for good. The work also sheds light on new facts previously unknown, such as the pressures from Zionist groups on Al-Ahram newspaper to stop Dr. Mahmoud's articles, and how these pressures escalated to the point of contacting Osama El-Baz, the Information Secretary to the President, about the matter. Additionally, it discusses Mustafa Mahmoud's articles on the issue of intercession, which he wrote in his final days and which sparked significant reactions, including media campaigns against him. This section also chronicles his unique experience in presenting his famous program \"Science and Faith,\" and it reviews the museum he founded as a club for scientists and his extensive charitable activities within the Mahmoud Mosque Association.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":215208,"logo_path":null,"name":"aljazeeradocumentary","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"العالم والإيمان","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
