A long-range missile fired at the plane caused it to crash into the Black Sea, claiming the lives of everyone on board, including 51 Israeli citizens. Oksana’s son, Iliya, was only 13 years old when he received the devastating news. And he can’t remember anything from that day. 20 years later, now married, Iliya decides to unlock his well-sealed Pandora’s box and find out: Who fired the missile that led to the plane crash, and why? Is Israel’s collective amnesia about this tragedy linked to the fact that most victims were new immigrants? And will he succeed in reclaiming the lost memories of his mother?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/aJp7r8J3Z8pJNliwdmm3R6V3QSE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2024-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flight 1812: Rediscovering Mom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4885886,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iliya Zeltser","original_name":"Iliya Zeltser","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bcd53b9d39cb8b1ac3557b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4885887,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Avner Toueg","original_name":"Avner Toueg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bcd5612b81fe8da8e9953e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4885886,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iliya Zeltser","original_name":"Iliya Zeltser","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bcd552176547614ce9951c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4885886,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iliya Zeltser","original_name":"Iliya Zeltser","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bcd54b360d0655eba45eff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4885883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irit Zeltser","original_name":"Irit Zeltser","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bcd4d9af6531eb748c8657","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4783275,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dafna Danenberg","original_name":"Dafna Danenberg","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bcd51ae654333593e99561","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32399158","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aJp7r8J3Z8pJNliwdmm3R6V3QSE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docaviv","release_date":"2024-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
