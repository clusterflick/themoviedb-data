In the video, the artist crosses the screen in a shot that reflects where the viewer would have stood in the original installation space at Bridget Donahue Gallery on 99 Bowery. A house re-mix amps up, the mirror-image melts and morphs into an AI montage. The prompts for DALL-E and RunwayML were actual exhibition views as well as the statement “two African American men, one in his 50s and one in his late 20s, stand in the middle of a crowded barber shop and shake hands.” The flood comes and DJ \"drops\" announce a rapid sequence of this fated meeting. This event may or may not have happened. Don’t you know, don’t, don’t, don’t …. We don’t know. AI is useful here: to conjure an image that Perry cannot do on her own.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"phantom. menace.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sondra Perry","original_name":"Sondra Perry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bad3e76f6c19f2c1914300","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/flOpx5dDFkvWVmvyZEF9wwaRuvR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
