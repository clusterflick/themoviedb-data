On average almost 1.5 million Aussie holiday makers take a cruise every year. It's part of an industry worth US$150 billion globally, employing over a million people catering to 32 million passengers. In Australia it contributes $5 billion to the local economy, generating more than 20,000 jobs.  That was until March this year. Now over 300 ghost ships swing on their anchors around the world with skeleton crews. The coronavirus pandemic is estimated to be costing the industry $60 million a day as cruise ships - some costing more than a billion dollars to build - lie idle.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oWRcpgIsaePmNcXLCWRKT1HPQ8R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Cruising: The Biggest Storm","title":"Cruising: The Biggest Storm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13957608","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oWRcpgIsaePmNcXLCWRKT1HPQ8R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
