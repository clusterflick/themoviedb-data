The video presents a collection of paintings created by a young 22-year-old Venezuelan artist, whose illustrations capture the essence of the cosmic balance of sexual energies and the search for the \"I AM\".  With the soundtrack by Brunello de Napoli, the work transforms into an immersive experience that invites the viewer to reflect on the invisible forces that shape the universe. The simplicity of the images, combined with the depth of the music, creates a silent dialogue that transcends words, inviting the audience to an introspective and spiritual journey.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xZ4yeFaa0MVSwrI8mJggJACRz9w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1992-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Divine Iliad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4883259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurizio Ummarino","original_name":"Maurizio Ummarino","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5z2Z1DCQysxAWgS5rUw2rGOM0jl.jpg","credit_id":"66bb654dab1bdb1c0cbde7a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4883266,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brunello di Napoli","original_name":"Brunello di Napoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bb662c0302cecc33bdec8c","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wAhxyRrizuWN0Ithw6Ngnrz6LTj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/xZ4yeFaa0MVSwrI8mJggJACRz9w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"United Nations Conference on Environment and Development - RIO92","release_date":"1992-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"TV Uni√£o","release_date":"2001-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
