His material covers a wealth of steam locomotive types from the South Western, including the oldest surviving member of the LSWR to the last Bulleid’s running on the Main Line in 1967.  For all of you who remember Waterloo as the start of wonderful holidays in Hampshire and Dorset – or as the start of yet another day’s work! – this dvd will bring back many memories of the last days of steam in the 1960s.  To the Southern enthusiast it brings back happy memories of Bulleids Nelsons, M7s, Arthurs, green coaches, Nine Elms, Eastleigh and branches. Geoff Holyoake filmed all these, and more, on 16mm colour film for his Meteor Films, which were sold in 8mm film form many years before video came on the scene.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jBuSquGU4albcxjXcUgeKT5oDpJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":236302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kingfisher Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Geoff Holyoake's South Western Lines","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4312869,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeremy English","original_name":"Jeremy English","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66c04bcfc9116bdea61f52ac","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4883197,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Geoff Holyoake","original_name":"Geoff Holyoake","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bb5cbcd5740b995abdb208","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4890612,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sarah Cousins","original_name":"Sarah Cousins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c04c0a43c61a5d3c2ab40f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4890610,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dennis Feltham","original_name":"Dennis Feltham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c04bea02f320957a1f538a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4312869,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeremy English","original_name":"Jeremy English","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c04c19cce704ebead31f9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jBuSquGU4albcxjXcUgeKT5oDpJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Production copyright notice is from 2002, but cannot locate anything more definitive","release_date":"2002-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
