Horny. Scared.","overview":"Following a sell-out Edinburgh Fringe and tour, Northern scamp Paddy Young's debut show mixes his charismatic, cult leader vibe with the inevitable reality that underneath it all he is hungry and scared (aren't we all?). Upon leaving a nightmare flatshare to move back in with his parents, Paddy is confronted with a spectacle that disturbingly resembles himself: Thor, a wanking walrus, stranded on Scarborough beach (it's real, look it up). Join Paddy as he asks the hard-hitting questions: is everyone in his generation going to die still living in a flatshare? If Hitler was on drugs, how bad was his comedown? And what happens to TikTok families after their 15 minutes of fame? Let's face it, Paddy is in the gutter, but he's looking down on all of you.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/hxZNyzABeWzhwjAhBoxioUxvWJl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137734,"logo_path":null,"name":"800 Pound Gorilla Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"He's hungry.
