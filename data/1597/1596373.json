After the unexpected appearance of the Angel of Aralar, Kiliki Frexko is entrusted with a divine mission: to save the Basque Country by organizing a gigantic concert. As a blind believer, he assembles the entire Chill Mafia crew to put on the biggest show of the century. But between technical difficulties and surreal situations, the road to the stage won't be easy. A madcap comedy where music, miracles, and chaos go hand in hand.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ilXbb8cwqJVvj7R4qPlWHRP3OWo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Historikoa: Chill Mafiaren Azken Kontzertuaren Historia Erreala","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Histórico.
