Gulian is later operated on by a skilled French surgeon and recovers his sight, only to find that Vida has left him and obtained a divorce. Gulian returns to his family in the United States and becomes engaged to Lael, a girl he had known before the war. During this time, Vida has also come to the United States and has become the companion of Gulian's mother. Gulian does not recognize Vida, whom he has never seen; in any event, she had told him that she was terribly disfigured in order to make him believe that she did not pity him. Gulian's wedding to Lael is halted when his brother-in-law kills himself after squandering the Eyre fortune. Lael soon breaks her engagement to the impoverished Gulian, who declares his love to Vida. Vida involuntarily reveals her identity, and Gulian's happiness is complete.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/27B1jp83jgpSdFo285obgheNNq3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3245,"logo_path":"/9dBTQp9XitrHkx20i1r9HhZ3Q6B.png","name":"First National Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Here is the kind of drama that the fans love, enacted with two of the greatest drawing cards of the screen.
