We meet this unorthodox man who can speak nonstop for hours without missing a beat, captivating and confounding his audience the entire time. But underneath the showman persona lives a more complex story. Through his unfiltered narration, we learn how he went from a healthy, happy kid, to a teenager whose own mind started turning against him. After major upheaval in his life, Steve developed severe OCD, struggled in school, and went out on his own, deciding to turn to entertaining others as a way to support himself.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jvyv6YAiCaXIa65kf1q0SvLsGrn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fears of a Clown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bart Vandever","original_name":"Bart Vandever","popularity":0.1137,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693ae0d34d4fe4d189af164b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bart Vandever","original_name":"Bart Vandever","popularity":0.1137,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693ae0ea71b6ceb822cdf36e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5871460,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Josh Polon","original_name":"Josh Polon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693ae17ed6cc3479eff62171","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5871461,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachel Meyrick","original_name":"Rachel Meyrick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693ae19baad698fb84f6228d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bart Vandever","original_name":"Bart Vandever","popularity":0.1137,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693ae1b363f806e65daea237","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151127,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adrien Prevost","original_name":"Adrien Prevost","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693ae209b9cd5eca59f621e1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5871461,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachel Meyrick","original_name":"Rachel Meyrick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693ae24a2705d5939a1ff4de","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bart Vandever","original_name":"Bart Vandever","popularity":0.1137,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693ae26871e3420fbb1ff3e8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5871461,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachel Meyrick","original_name":"Rachel Meyrick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693ae27b9e69f7bfe0cdf385","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jvyv6YAiCaXIa65kf1q0SvLsGrn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
