So does the question of who should control them. Our attitudes about controlling human reproduction through abortion and contraception have changed radically over the centuries. So have our perceptions of the moral and ethical issues involved. The Roots of Roe reveals the story of abortion and contraception in America from the first surgical abortion in 1742 to the struggles over Roe v. Wade. In a debate often reduced to simple-minded slogans, The Roots of Roe offers partisans and the public a unique historical perspective on contemporary issues.  —Captured Time Productions","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The American history behind the most controversial decision of modern times.","title":"Roots of Roe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Archer","original_name":"Anne Archer","popularity":1.5995,"profile_path":"/y1uFANprVvJ9cCqVKSl0umIpIXw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Letters to Margaret Sanger (voice)","credit_id":"6939dec6bcb30b83e7b83db5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharine Hepburn","original_name":"Katharine Hepburn","popularity":0.7481,"profile_path":"/hzBSOe6bburyMeeCqD9kR9tRfdD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Katharine Houghton-Hepburn (voice)","credit_id":"6939deff0f85a1216edfa656","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Burstyn","original_name":"Ellen Burstyn","popularity":3.3736,"profile_path":"/uEHZoAtCnGCXvQDHe3s3DWW2G1c.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6939df0e2cd7309810ae9ef6","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0467484","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1993-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
