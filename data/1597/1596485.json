The band always intended to revisit the Guthrie archive and create more songs, but didn’t get the chance until April 2022. They recorded two albums, ‘This Machine Still Kills Fascists’ (2022) and ‘Okemah Rising’ (2023), in Tulsa, Oklahoma, going fully acoustic for the first time as a tribute to Guthrie. The project also led to their first seated theater tour. “This Machine Rising” tells the story of Dropkick Murphys’ journey with Woody Guthrie’s lyrics, focusing on the Tulsa sessions, the theater tour, and the enduring power of music and words to unite the working class and promote equity.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ijX6ihGUxHdQsgaphAHiPQnfwWB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":282884,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dummy Luck Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Machine Rising","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4777126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dropkick Murphys","original_name":"Dropkick Murphys","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693a262b046baef7c8b83e0a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Guthrie","original_name":"Nora Guthrie","popularity":0.1874,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693a263db19c644c771d287a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5870330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Castelaz","original_name":"Jeff Castelaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693a270c4c2913761eae9ff9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5870332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Knox","original_name":"Teresa Knox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693a2718c8a2172281aea0dd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5870334,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dave Stauble","original_name":"Dave Stauble","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693a272f52ce5b92b76902b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5870334,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dave Stauble","original_name":"Dave Stauble","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693a2744b19c644c771d287e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5870334,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dave Stauble","original_name":"Dave Stauble","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693a2762833c4246f91ff253","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rw5BC9LRO8f7UALnPzx9eQnNFKQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ijX6ihGUxHdQsgaphAHiPQnfwWB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
