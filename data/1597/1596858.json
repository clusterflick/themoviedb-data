Immigrating to Canada as a kid, Richard brought with him his unwavering love for the sport. Though having never played professionally, competitive opportunities to play quickly dry up for football players approaching 30 and the mounting pressures of financial and career stability often forces soccer to take a back seat. For Richard, that is simply an impossibility. His refusal to relinquish his passion for football leads him on a journey navigating a nonstop assortment of pick up games, indoor tournaments, beer leagues and even varsity college soccer to get his fix. When he’s not playing, he's working as a referee and youth soccer coach to pay for his college education.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When there's a will, there's a way","title":"FIELDS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5871752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Stewart","original_name":"Richard Stewart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"693b09d5cb0185ed4eac9a37","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5402671,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lachlan Brown-Sutherland","original_name":"Lachlan Brown-Sutherland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693b09f2275fd195626ec037","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
