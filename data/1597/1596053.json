This experimental and intimate film threads together voice notes, journal entries and conversations of the filmmaker, Tash, and her partner, Ange, in an attempt to make sense of their dreams, fears and the major life events that occur whilst on tour: the idea of motherhood after losing a mother, a birthday, an injury. Filmed in East London, across the Netherlands and Latvia, the film explores togetherness when apart and exists, in itself, as an artefact of the relationship.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Still, Moving","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2715432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tash Tung","original_name":"Tash Tung","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69395cdce4b3c5dae87fd00d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"London Short Film Festival","release_date":"2026-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
