At its centre is legendary entertainer Doug Lucas, who reflects on the early days of drag as camp comedy, its marginalisation within the queer community and the pivotal role drag queens played during the AIDS crisis. Intercut with Doug’s memories and contemporaneous archival news footage are vibrant performances and candid reflections from a new generation of drag artists.  In the present day, drag becomes a form of transformation, armour and freedom: a space to explore gender, authenticity and fantasy on one’s own terms. Juxtaposing past and present, Queens reveals drag as both resistance and celebration, as well as a living legacy of creativity and community.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
