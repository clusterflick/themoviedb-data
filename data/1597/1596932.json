Continuing his series of acclaimed stagings of early 20th-century Italian operas at Deutsche Oper, Christof Loy promises to bring a characteristic mixture of intelligence and style to Giordano's work, while the world-class cast – conducted by John Fiore – guarantees a feast for lovers of great singing. A gripping operatic treat for aficionados and newcomers alike.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9aBWUFzqElfaONuDrflXLvHw3Is.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175353,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsche Oper
