Intimately filmed from dual perspectives, the journey of Adam, a transgender teen, is told through his viewpoint as well as through the lens of his mother, visual artist and filmmaker Amy Jenkins. As Adam asserts his identity and branches out into the world, his mother grapples with the evolving nature of parenthood and the emotional process of letting go. Through a visually poetic approach, the film transforms a personal archive of over two decades into a powerful response to current debates around identity and autonomy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pwyEcurvYaAKhtpTuacxsDwRlqF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adam's Apple","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2020615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amy K.
