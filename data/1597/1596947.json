At night, television screens play Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves; by day, news broadcasts, comedians, and onlookers watch with an almost Orwellian detachment as human life struggles forward in its quest for dignity. Morin continues his numerology of the world in a film that draws on the history of cinema to confront a reality riddled with meaningless screens. A finale that shatters the mirror. And stitches it back together.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2026-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Six portraits néoréalistes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Morin","original_name":"Robert Morin","popularity":0.3294,"profile_path":"/xgRXdfAswhAmdd8fA8hC1pG1Pbt.jpg","credit_id":"693b2af1a1fedb4441e0b869","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"2e Semaine de la Critique, Montréal","release_date":"2026-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
