This uplifting project follows a group of young dancers as they collaborate with internationally acclaimed choreographer Kim Brandstrup and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.  Born out the the OAE's residency at North London's Acland Burghley School, Brandstrup, together with professional dancers Tommy Franzen, Deavion Brown, and Seirian Griffiths, worked with students over two years to create a new piece that fuses hip hop movement with the intricate musical world of J.S. Bach. The result was an exhilarating, sold-out performance at the 2025 Edinburgh International Festival.  As the project grew, so did the students. Their uncertainty transforms into confidence, joy, and a mesmerizing new dance language. Their natural rhythmic intelligence becomes the key to unlocking Bach's complex music, revealing unexpected links between Baroque counterpoint and the street-style flow of hip hop.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breaking Bach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5869135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nafisah Baba","original_name":"Nafisah Baba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693998b5880d4e8f2af87a5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5869136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deavion Brown","original_name":"Deavion Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693998bd800fc9aa4b7fcd5a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5869137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuel Bruno","original_name":"Emmanuel Bruno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693998c43bb9094aae3cf29a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5869139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurora Casatori","original_name":"Aurora Casatori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693998cb05c5e584d2eb2df9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5869140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Codling","original_name":"Jack Codling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693998d2800fc9aa4b7fcd64","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5869142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Fichelson","original_name":"Oscar Fichelson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693998d9cd238b08aceb2359","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5869143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Franzen","original_name":"Tommy Franzen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693998e1cd046ff79eaf04e7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5869145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seirian Griffiths","original_name":"Seirian Griffiths","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693998e9ea49e1be0b3cf025","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5869146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Howell","original_name":"Justin Howell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693998f0fc555ffe0ef7d43c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5869147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeriah Kibusi","original_name":"Jeriah Kibusi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693998f9fba8170955f87bac","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5869149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robbie Ordona","original_name":"Robbie Ordona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"69399900170432354c135152","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5869150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elyse Renwick-Ashun","original_name":"Elyse Renwick-Ashun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693999070c198b9563f879a4","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5869152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abe Taylor","original_name":"Abe Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6939990dbc71ec2d9ef7d5b7","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725185,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kim Brandstrup","original_name":"Kim Brandstrup","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6939985a8a1090de39134eb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725185,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kim Brandstrup","original_name":"Kim Brandstrup","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6939987178446420e0eb2162","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Does hip hop dance work with Baroque Music?
