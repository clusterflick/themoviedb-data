He allows us to enter their farms with astounding naturalness. This moving film speaks, with great serenity, of our roots and of the future of the people who work on the land. This the last part of Depardon's triptych \"Profils paysans\" about what it is like to be a farmer today in an isolated highland area in France. \"La vie moderne\" examines what has become of the persons he has followed for ten years, while featuring younger people who try to farm or raise cattle or poultry, come hell or high water.","popularity":0.9101,"poster_path":"/h8IWYCY8fA1VclmjZghVQ3sZwsN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15670,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palmeraie et
