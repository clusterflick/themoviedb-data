While she has little problem finding someone for a one night stand, she rebuffs her lovers in such a rude way that they actually don't know what's going on. But what seems to be a negative attitude at first glance is in fact much worse: Maria is suffering from borderline syndrome, a serious psychotic disease that makes her fail to develop a continuous, reliable personality, from her own perspective as well as from the perspective of those she meets. Then one day, she bumps into Jan, a student who falls in love with her without delay. He's awaiting a hard time when he has to learn how hard it is to stay loyal and faithful to a person who, in her own words, \"has a different world inside of her head\" and who feels that \"there is something inside of me that eats me up.\"","popularity":0.7582,"poster_path":"/qcRdeDMxJZs1FwhrzyCDgshnYV1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alone","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":23,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lavinia
