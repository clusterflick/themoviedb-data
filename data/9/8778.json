Borrowing the character of Psyche from mythology and placing her in Europe in the 19th century, the authors give her a \"modern\" life. She is an attractive young woman - and remains so throughout the film, in spite of one hardship after another. Psyche is libidinous, and her prurient interests shock her staid contemporaries.","popularity":0.5587,"poster_path":"/6VWJj2Kimrpyi8XLubYggybglDX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hunnia
