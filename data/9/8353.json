Bound by the confines of their shared space, every aspect of their existence becomes a boundary, underscoring their plight.","popularity":0.7112,"poster_path":"/zqFTlwvSxlMLdQDDYOo4JkjxYNq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinédia","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1931-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No
