C.H. (Luc Matte) used to be a star player for the Montreal Canadiens and has turned in his puck and hockey stick for the pursuit of women -- as well as a good game of chess (he is a master at that too). He supports himself by waiting tables and one day takes some time off to go on vacation in the Quebec wilderness, where some local thugs give him a hard time. From that point onward, things get worse after one of the hooligans is accidentally killed.","popularity":0.297,"poster_path":"/dPB21Z8qDHE6j0jVXtx2aNzkzlm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9181,"logo_path":"/hObQEBMY8Es6ajSlVeBEIdqbuSK.png","name":"Art Theatre
