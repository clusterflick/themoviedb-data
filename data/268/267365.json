Whether you climb F5 or F7c, these films are packed with tips to help you improve every aspect of your climbing performance.

There are right and wrong examples to help you identify your weaknesses and case studies from some of Britain’s best climbers. Those dream routes may be closer than you think and watching these films might be all you need to turn them into a reality.","popularity":0.4818,"poster_path":"/e1JElMip4L7YP6X7iInOlJHBNjl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22556,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crux
