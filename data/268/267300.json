We're talking about more than a simple commitment to a creed or an ideology, we're talking about accepting to be a part of a world created out of your own convictions, and eluding any coexistence with everything that's different from that. How do you film this semi-limbo that has its own notion of time and history? This seems to be the question Nikolas Klement asks himself in his first film, a documentary that goes deep into a Mennonite community in La Pampa and portrays its everyday activities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2013-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ekpyrosis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1314846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikolas Klement","original_name":"Nikolas Klement","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535f44f40e0a264fd80075e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2808084","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BAFICI - Buenos Aires Film Festival","release_date":"2013-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
