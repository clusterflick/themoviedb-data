Most interesting is the history of the Pullman car.  In the beginning, it served as transport for a princely family; then became the headquarters car for the military high command; and then, most adventurous of all, it ended up with a circus.  Converted to a bar, it finally had its day and was supposed to serve as a placard carrier.  Luckily, the museum saved it from this sad fate.","popularity":0.3434,"poster_path":"/vfYJtAnQWWULhiDR0JeshWF71JP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1939-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salonwagen
