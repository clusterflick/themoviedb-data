It is based on La dame aux Camélias (1852), a play adapted from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, fils. The opera was originally entitled Violetta, after the main character. It was first performed on 6 March 1853 at the La Fenice opera house in Venice.  Piave and Verdi wanted to follow Dumas in giving the opera a contemporary setting, but the authorities at La Fenice insisted that it be set in the past, \"c. 1700\". It was not until the 1880s that the composer and librettist's original wishes were carried out and \"realistic\" productions were staged.[3]","popularity":0.175,"poster_path":"/sfQlLJVUeKWVJdXmcZrXPulXkbn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Traviata","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Giuseppe Verdi - La traviata (Orchestra of the Royal Opera House feat. conductor: Georg Solti)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ジュゼッペ・ヴェルディ - 椿姫（ゲオルク・ショルティ指揮ロイヤル・オペラ・ハウス管弦楽団）","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":262687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Gheorghiu","original_name":"Angela Gheorghiu","popularity":0.1142,"profile_path":"/tmgmVyEDOQugjUJX2u14JTqLjqk.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Violeta Valéry","credit_id":"5362db230e0a261df80007c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leah-Marian Jones","original_name":"Leah-Marian Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Flora Bervoix","credit_id":"5362db390e0a261dfb0007c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1143402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gillian Knight","original_name":"Gillian Knight","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Annina","credit_id":"5362db570e0a261df80007cf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Lopardo","original_name":"Frank Lopardo","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/fHgq5OCHOEW8R7yI35L8As0wp1d.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alfredo Germont","credit_id":"5362db700e0a261e010007ec","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Nucci","original_name":"Leo Nucci","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":"/fre6T3D9ba2DwpOz3mxnetRr8JW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Giorgio Germont","credit_id":"5362db820e0a261df80007d3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orchestra of the Royal Opera House","original_name":"Orchestra of the Royal Opera House","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffabe731c0435003fbd217f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234023,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georg Solti","original_name":"Georg Solti","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/aeGFb8BBQq8jIywJPpJJBaWF1EN.jpg","credit_id":"56b220e9c3a3687e18002a62","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148077,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandre Dumas fils","original_name":"Alexandre Dumas fils","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/ipR2EbPl6cuPmCONW8MA8zsTbhC.jpg","credit_id":"5697e22ac3a3687600000399","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Maria Piave","original_name":"Francesco Maria Piave","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5697e21cc3a3687608000363","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"5697e209c3a3687600000394","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Eyre","original_name":"Richard Eyre","popularity":0.3545,"profile_path":"/bWcMJmEkdx0ZrLI2oogA9iF3FXJ.jpg","credit_id":"67dfe13e7d0565af0207c013","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0253836","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sfQlLJVUeKWVJdXmcZrXPulXkbn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"Italian\"}","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
