Now Delancourt (Bernard Giraudeau) is apparently living a good life managing a gym in a Paris hotel under Nazi control, where he meets his former friend Pierre (Christophe Malavoy), who is on a secret assignment to mislead the Nazis on the date of the Normandie invasion. Pierre, alias Augustin, cannot figure out if Delancourt is a real resistance fighter or if he is a double agent. Circumstances create a larger and larger gap between the former friends while the plot goes through several twists and turns before Pierre's doubts are resolved.","popularity":0.2747,"poster_path":"/k4e7bHsKBlCVw83D46cgF5qf3h2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bras de fer","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Giraudeau","original_name":"Bernard Giraudeau","popularity":0.4278,"profile_path":"/pA4JyvB1YU3JswdVtxkBaYoCHS1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Delancourt, dit Condor","credit_id":"5f5a72037314a10037daee7b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Malavoy","original_name":"Christophe Malavoy","popularity":0.255,"profile_path":"/4dNe1odZn3SBza3KVLDT0glp5wP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pierre Wagnies, alias Augustin","credit_id":"5f5a721260c51d003845fbbc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ángela Molina","original_name":"Ángela Molina","popularity":0.9936,"profile_path":"/fFpLkG4gBqxF89yRihq8y1DJtkT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Camille Delancourt","credit_id":"5f5a7235d8cc4a0039e38e16","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":36925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Carrière","original_name":"Mathieu Carrière","popularity":0.9587,"profile_path":"/bi7jNA5eVdosZYAyCqsPY3VtzDp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"von Bleicher","credit_id":"5f5a724360c51d003a47d6bf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre-Loup Rajot","original_name":"Pierre-Loup Rajot","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/bdPzeiMZGKfTCpDc2KtAvsyTxwa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Potier","credit_id":"5f5a724f5c324700371cc5cb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Lalande","original_name":"François Lalande","popularity":0.1248,"profile_path":"/btZxxwq1Ek698gawWtgRjmeHHsj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Werner","credit_id":"5f5a7265ec0c580035a4a856","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnès Garreau","original_name":"Agnès Garreau","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":"/aE0hqwfUZ5rf9nJJ9EjrLseOxIN.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"La fiancée de Potier","credit_id":"6763b5e56aea1fff30ab219c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thierry Ravel","original_name":"Thierry Ravel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Le Gitan","credit_id":"6763b609e14e3bcfa74a4426","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Meeks","original_name":"Edward Meeks","popularity":0.3,"profile_path":"/uc2Y543rIkUeRwWZ1UXREVlElM6.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Le colonel","credit_id":"6763b648161ab7dec50002e0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Miquel","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Miquel","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/7H4Dg8hBWqGOidBozLxcdgXKnfK.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6763b669e14e3bcfa74a443b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-France Santon","original_name":"Marie-France Santon","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/iSg2rDeNWv6xC6MP8S5oRt3VGqN.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6763b683178bde9bac4a4711","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":222568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Vergez","original_name":"Gérard Vergez","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"588a9a1bc3a368413b020327","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":222568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Vergez","original_name":"Gérard Vergez","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"588a9a16c3a368181000d46b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0088844","wikidata_id":"Q2923907","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uJysA2AG8H8utCnwP6Mvhznx0DN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.736,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/k4e7bHsKBlCVw83D46cgF5qf3h2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":552}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1985-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
