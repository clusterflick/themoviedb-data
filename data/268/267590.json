Fuller shot footage of his commanding officer's marching Czech locals, who denied knowing of the genocide, out from town to view the horrors of the death house. 40 years later, French documentary filmmaker Emil Weiss brought Fuller, who became a famous film director after World War II, back to the death camp to tell the story of the camp's liberation. Fuller's original footage is incorporated in the film.","popularity":0.1809,"poster_path":"/mQTO11nv9eNFcsMbPPFZ88VKdIy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1988-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falkenau, the Impossible","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Falkenau - the Impossible","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Fuller","original_name":"Samuel Fuller","popularity":0.2816,"profile_path":"/yC1rWSkV8crevItmlRz056GOTMf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Samuel Fuller","credit_id":"53616e7b0e0a2649b1000419","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emil Weiss","original_name":"Emil Weiss","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53616e430e0a2649a900043b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0384093","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/mQTO11nv9eNFcsMbPPFZ88VKdIy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (New York)","release_date":"1988-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
