Strauss and his librettist, Hugo von Hofmannstahl, transformed Sophocles' take on Homer's tale into a harrowing opera noir. Elektra lives for one reason, to kill her mother, Klyt√§mnestra, and her stepfather, Aegisth, the murderers of her father, Agamemnon. In contrast to Elektra's vengeful obsession, her sister Chrysothemis desires to get on with life. When their long-missing brother, Orestes, returns to do the deed, Elektra celebrates with a dance of death and, her sole purpose in life fulfilled, dies. Strauss joined the hermetic plot to music of the utmost opulence, violent and yearning by turns, evoking the cardinal principles of Greek tragedy - pity and terror.","popularity":0.1579,"poster_path":"/nLYMj3C1rHQk2cyi6CqGBIHs8zC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strauss: Elektra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mignon Dunn","original_name":"Mignon Dunn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Clitemnestra","credit_id":"53602386c3a368373a000028","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birgit Nilsson","original_name":"Birgit Nilsson","popularity":0.1054,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Elektra","credit_id":"53602416c3a3683761000033","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1315097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonie Rysanek","original_name":"Leonie Rysanek","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/qmHCNhrvcWpB1tJX3FBzCBQyhjG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Crisotemis","credit_id":"53602436c3a3683733000031","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1062356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Nagy","original_name":"Robert Nagy","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Egisto","credit_id":"5360244bc3a3683761000037","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald McIntyre","original_name":"Donald McIntyre","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":"/7LVQxIzV2JYIl0BmftyfNLWXdh8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Orestes","credit_id":"5360245dc3a368375800004d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cheek","original_name":"John Cheek","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tutor de Orestes","credit_id":"53602476c3a368373a00003c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248678,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Levine","original_name":"James Levine","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/p6ujBSZMKTc2zNCytIvvg9NKL1D.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5ddeea533faba0001904dadd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MET Orchestra","original_name":"MET Orchestra","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff574bcb865eb003cb1a818","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1314736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Stivender","original_name":"David Stivender","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536024b9c3a368373300003a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116795,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Strauss","original_name":"Richard Strauss","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/yMUgur4kSGUAkMV1ujDKZoJNDri.jpg","credit_id":"65986755bd588b01a956aca0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2469241,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hugo von Hofmannstahl","original_name":"Hugo von Hofmannstahl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddee9a94d679100171bd675","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1118202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Graf","original_name":"Herbert Graf","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddeea3f1c6329001200bd47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nLYMj3C1rHQk2cyi6CqGBIHs8zC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1988-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
