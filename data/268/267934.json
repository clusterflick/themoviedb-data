With some 35 years in the business and a string of controversies under his belt, ranging from the oral decapitation of small animals to bladder relief on one of the USA's most sacred monuments, Ozzy has truly encapsulated the rock 'n' roll lifestyle. On this film we go behind the scenes and discover what it is that has driven this Brummie dropout to become Lord of the Manor, King of the Heap, and The Crown Prince of Darkness.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This documentary uses interviews with Ozzy and those closest to him, along with previously unseen footage, revealing the true, often misunderstood, story of the Madman of Rock!","title":"Ozzy: Crown Prince of the Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
