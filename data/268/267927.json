He is showing his victims the movies before torturing and killing them with a cow skull. The first story deals with two inspectors hunting a cannibal serial killer called \"The Tiger\". The second is about a 'not-so-devoted' husband interested in having a night of perverted sex with a prostitute in a motel room. The third is a tragical love story between a poor, little man oppressed by his wife and an handsome boy with self-destruction tendencies.","popularity":0.1896,"poster_path":"/vxrAPmpjMAeNhy0nIV138jm7htp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22779,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vallastudio Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2009-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dirty Love","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1286363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Soto","original_name":"François Soto","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"El Italiano","credit_id":"536431030e0a2647ce00013b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Belmar","original_name":"George Belmar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Toro Loco","credit_id":"536431130e0a2647cb000147","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ignacio Muñoz","original_name":"Ignacio Muñoz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Felipe","credit_id":"536431240e0a2647d8000126","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1107724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patricio Valladares","original_name":"Patricio Valladares","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/jZBU57UooUOQtVsjDqW3OjJmBsL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tigre","credit_id":"5364312e0e0a2647d800012c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuri Caceres Zapata","original_name":"Yuri Caceres Zapata","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Detective","credit_id":"5364313d0e0a2647db000152","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharlotta","original_name":"Sharlotta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Niña","credit_id":"5364314e0e0a2647c8000145","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1107724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patricio Valladares","original_name":"Patricio Valladares","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/jZBU57UooUOQtVsjDqW3OjJmBsL.jpg","credit_id":"5364317c0e0a2647d8000135","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1107724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patricio Valladares","original_name":"Patricio Valladares","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/jZBU57UooUOQtVsjDqW3OjJmBsL.jpg","credit_id":"536431620e0a2647c800014a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316208,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Evelyn Belmar","original_name":"Evelyn Belmar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5364318c0e0a2647cb000150","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316207,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrea Cavaletto","original_name":"Andrea Cavaletto","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5364316f0e0a2647d8000133","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1107724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patricio Valladares","original_name":"Patricio Valladares","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/jZBU57UooUOQtVsjDqW3OjJmBsL.jpg","credit_id":"536431970e0a2647d100013c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1530883","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1404,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vxrAPmpjMAeNhy0nIV138jm7htp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3307,"name":"surreal"},{"id":10292,"name":"gore"},{"id":201345,"name":"toro loco"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
