While she should be taking care of her ten-year-old daughter and the household, her routine is falling apart and she is falling further into depression. Israel is just before the outbreak of the Six-Day War in 1967. The historical events echo in the lives of the characters only from a great distance. The female characters within the family wage a more important battle for their own identity. The director intentionally chose the parallel stories of three female protagonists: ten-year-old Michal who is just starting to acknowledge her sexuality, a single university student and Ruth, a trapped housewife.","popularity":0.1014,"poster_path":"/o3cweEA70XWefcOuNYn55drEBRT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2013-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tam idan hatmimut","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Plasticine","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Fragile","type":"Alternative international title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":998563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reymonde Amsallem","original_name":"Reymonde Amsallem","popularity":0.2667,"profile_path":"/79G5CHsOHHbfvDqXu99RzzDTCVB.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"535fa9e10e0a264fe50081be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3293411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Dubrovitzki","original_name":"Ana Dubrovitzki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64291fc401b1ca0097fdc80a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3990468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yehezkel Lazarov","original_name":"Yehezkel Lazarov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64291fcc0f36550110790256","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":52684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hana Laslo","original_name":"Hana Laslo","popularity":0.2297,"profile_path":"/7qBri3zUXGgo1cjfOhOtsQlSnP4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64291fd59cc67b05e2017e4e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2380265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maya Gorkin","original_name":"Maya Gorkin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64291fea0f365500f1c23cf8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3990471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yael Ben-Dor","original_name":"Yael Ben-Dor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64291ff160975000eb3ea6fc","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":101696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vardit Bilu","original_name":"Vardit Bilu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535fa9fc0e0a264fde007e3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42413,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shai Goldman","original_name":"Shai Goldman","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6429202a960cde00e0bd19c8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51086,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joel Alexis","original_name":"Joel Alexis","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6429201fa3e4ba00b423e637","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368659,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ran Bagno","original_name":"Ran Bagno","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642920158de0ae00b654d64c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":101696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vardit Bilu","original_name":"Vardit Bilu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64292009a3e4ba00d3adf553","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2980684","wikidata_id":"Q52837419","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":1556,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o3cweEA70XWefcOuNYn55drEBRT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
