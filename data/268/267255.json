Plácido Domingo is Des Grieux, the handsome, headstrong young aristocrat who falls head over heels for the enticing, impetuous Manon Lescaut (Renata Scotto). Manon returns his love, but her obsession with luxury ruins them both. Gian Carlo Menotti’s opulent production, with sets and costumes by Desmond Heeley, superbly captures the colorful world of 18th century France.","popularity":0.603,"poster_path":"/sZgIh6WZRkmnBhUKOuaUxkF5Gkm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan
