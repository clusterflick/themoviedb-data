The film is divided into five parts. Each part covers a time frame ranging from April 4, 1992, the beginning of the war, to the present. The major issues that occur are three-fold. It depicts the systematic genocide of Bosnians, the silence of Western countries, and the determination of the Bosnians to resist. They refuse to be seen as victims, even though the filmmakers portray them so. Also included are the origins and political aspects of the war. It offers interviews with participants. It also reveals how the U.S. State Department censored reports about Serbian death camps.","popularity":0.4238,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bosnia!","video":false,"vote_average":3.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":411038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard-Henri Lévy","original_name":"Bernard-Henri Lévy","popularity":0.1686,"profile_path":"/qtif2EebTLcqeOvbRARhcvRVXkw.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"562a9458925141284c002cdf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Ferrari","original_name":"Alain Ferrari","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"562a946b925141400600132f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208266,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gilles Hertzog","original_name":"Gilles Hertzog","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"562a948ac3a3681b59002abf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":411038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard-Henri Lévy","original_name":"Bernard-Henri Lévy","popularity":0.1686,"profile_path":"/qtif2EebTLcqeOvbRARhcvRVXkw.jpg","credit_id":"562a9474c3a3681b4b0027fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":411038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard-Henri Lévy","original_name":"Bernard-Henri Lévy","popularity":0.1686,"profile_path":"/qtif2EebTLcqeOvbRARhcvRVXkw.jpg","credit_id":"562a947ec3a3681b5c002a96","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0109319","wikidata_id":"Q20004561","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1662,"name":"bosnia and herzegovina"},{"id":7973,"name":"bosnian war (1992-95)"},{"id":177913,"name":"death camp"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
