Searching for inspiration (and a better life?), he comes across the two sole remaining residents: the aged Don Jesús Vallejo and his son Juan Diego. Fascinated by their isolated lives and Juan Diego’s absolute loneliness, Sebastian starts to film. The improbable but intense friendship that arises between them is rudely disrupted when Sebastian goes back to the city - but he promises to return.","popularity":0.312,"poster_path":"/s6UoYFFR6eAFVJHkKBuxMCeEg9D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Land of Silence","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1204103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilberto Barraza","original_name":"Gilberto Barraza","popularity":0.1203,"profile_path":"/sHSpqLD1HZbzLjyGvdMlgML9j09.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"53635897c3a36815950018e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waldo Facco","original_name":"Waldo Facco","popularity":0.1431,"profile_path":"/AfxyVacF7Kgw9yxynCAhkquek6p.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"536358a5c3a368156f0019c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesús Vallejo","original_name":"Jesús Vallejo","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"536358b1c3a36815950018e6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalia Gatto","original_name":"Natalia Gatto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"536358b7c3a3681576001967","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Armella","original_name":"Carlos Armella","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536358ebc3a3681576001972","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Armella","original_name":"Carlos Armella","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536358e2c3a368156f0019d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3671924","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s6UoYFFR6eAFVJHkKBuxMCeEg9D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
