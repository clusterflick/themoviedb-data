The two earlier documentaries, \"Porquoi Israel,\" and \"Shoah,\" have had great effect on the ways documentaries are produced. \"Tsahal\" zeroes in on the crucial role of the military in Israeli society and politics. The film uses many in-depth interviews to present the many feelings and thoughts about the Israeli military.","popularity":0.6192,"poster_path":"/7K83Cik0gHSS52zqqkPCIqNDqjb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75642,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Aleph","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":54938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Dussart","origin_country":""},{"id":1704,"logo_path":"/sb3PuMTgJgpPUY7x634etBAhodu.png","name":"Bavaria Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1994-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":304,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tsahal","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Lanzmann","original_name":"Claude Lanzmann","popularity":0.1438,"profile_path":"/lD6OD0OoTNMqXBC3uXgRrE2tmlh.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self -
