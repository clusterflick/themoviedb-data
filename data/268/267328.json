Coniferous and subtropical forests, wetlands, and montane grasslands are as much a part of this world as the inhospitable, frozen mountaintops that tower above.  The word Himalaya is Sanskrit for abode of snow, fitting for a stretch of land that houses the worldâ€™s largest non polar ice masses. Extensive glacial networks feed Asia's major rivers including the Ganges, Indus, and Brahmaputra. More than a billion people rely on these glacier-fed water sources for drinking water and agriculture. The Himalayas are not only a remarkable expanse of natural beauty. They're also crucial for our survival.","popularity":1.3515,"poster_path":"/6JZGoQBKYP7FfWDanMLrffJ1es6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134683,"logo_path":"/7i3upiV2YtUjCMqheIIhBaOwUbF.png","name":"Rubin Tarrant Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Himalayas","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Nature: The Himalayas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Morgan","original_name":"Chris Morgan","popularity":0.097,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5496ee849251416e1e005e06","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115271,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brian McDairmant","original_name":"Brian McDairmant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b62d9cadb6b00e11fc3f9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Buchanan","original_name":"Gordon Buchanan","popularity":0.1483,"profile_path":"/d46i6uamQqZ8II3E8XmiFfQwBd6.jpg","credit_id":"650b62eb501cf201001c6dfa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martyn Colbeck","original_name":"Martyn Colbeck","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b63f081c7be010052d5dc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179620,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Brown","original_name":"John Brown","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b635eb1f68d0100fdd06c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2286234,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul D.
