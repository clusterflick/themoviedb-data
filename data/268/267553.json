The film, rendered in text, focuses on the repetitive motion of foodstuffs being cooked in the lobby of a discount department store. Says Arcangel, \"I composed Urbandale by creating my own software and using ASCII (text) as the only means of display [...] I have 'frozen' a certain time and aesthetic in computer culture [...] The soundtrack for Urbandale was also composed by myself and recorded with 12 electric guitars\".","popularity":0.0432,"poster_path":"/u7797be4BqvLuasMOVXmdDoP2bI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urbandale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cory Arcangel","original_name":"Cory Arcangel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/phoefZYXidj7OaPaPZbB5qrWnf6.jpg","credit_id":"536138230e0a2649b8000094","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u7797be4BqvLuasMOVXmdDoP2bI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
