It is 1912, and the old man still believes in the old rules which strait-jacket \"men of class.\" He believes that the elite have the right to conquer where they can, that they should refrain from publicizing their improprieties, and he is rabidly pro-military. Adrian, kicked out of his military school for his own improprieties (and hiding that from his father), is naturally drawn to Vicky a beautiful divorced woman and friend of the family who is staying at their mansion. The family tutor, a man of ordinary background (with some ideas which seem radical in this household) is similarly smitten. On the basis of their shared attraction, the two men form a friendship. Meanwhile, the object of their affection finds it diverting to toy with them.","popularity":0.4258,"poster_path":"/xPkIkwaR5bEjPKcmDxxskBID3ng.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Partner's
