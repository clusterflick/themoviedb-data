The Philips corporation commissioned Le Corbusier to design the pavilion, which was intended as a showcase of their engineering progress.  The pavilion was shaped like a stomach, with a narrow entrance and exit on either side of a large central space. As the audience entered and exited the pavilion, the electronic composition Concret PH by Iannis Xenakis (who also acted as Le Corbusier's architectural assistant for the pavilion's design) was heard. Poème électronique was synchronized to a film of black and white photographs selected by Le Corbusier which touched on vague themes of human existence.","popularity":0.136,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1958-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Electronic Poem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris","original_name":"Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/iTbPg7CJmkPzZkTJUpWgCOk83p2.jpg","credit_id":"543652e90e0a264d66001f64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edgard Varèse","original_name":"Edgard Varèse","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/rpXOr0a8cE43TVcefPwV1MMfL2Z.jpg","credit_id":"54363016c3a36836e70019df","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315573,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Iannis Xenakis","original_name":"Iannis Xenakis","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/75jGfZS2mJS0gG1lLvUYt9esqfi.jpg","credit_id":"54363132c3a36836e7001a10","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris","original_name":"Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/iTbPg7CJmkPzZkTJUpWgCOk83p2.jpg","credit_id":"5436305c0e0a2624b900197f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1958-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
