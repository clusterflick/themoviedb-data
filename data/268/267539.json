But what is globalisation? And where is this global village? In 2001, John Pilger made 'The New Rulers of the World', a film exploring the impact of globalisation. It took Indonesia as the prime example, a country that the World Bank described as a 'model pupil' until its 'globalised' economy collapsed in 1998. Globalisation has not only made the world smaller. It has also made it interdependent. An investment decision made in London can spell unemployment for thousands in Indonesia, while a business decision taken in Tokyo can create thousands of new jobs for workers in north-east England.","popularity":0.0956,"poster_path":"/vw1N1xBgbYW4PHUAnhAV9TDyWZE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New Rulers of the World","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Pilger","original_name":"John Pilger","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/jgV0P0JOkDAKLaOBEuaoRdlhFp2.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"659547d6ea37e007ca4bb52a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2089824,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pramoedya Ananta Toer","original_name":"Pramoedya Ananta Toer","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/wMHWLEp7HyYlvOitRcr352xbVVG.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"65915fe5a58902717f9639b8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2580713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Monbiot","original_name":"George Monbiot","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/1nhyL5z5DyAzzBEiY5QDLvKb5ED.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65915fd651a64e02e2f479ca","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dita Sari","original_name":"Dita Sari","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"65915ff2651fcf5eba8e5cd0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Pilger","original_name":"John Pilger","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/jgV0P0JOkDAKLaOBEuaoRdlhFp2.jpg","credit_id":"6595489f0e64af2bf28c1907","department":"Crew","job":"Presenter"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Lowery","original_name":"Alan Lowery","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a18a3fc390c500eb35795b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Lowery","original_name":"Alan Lowery","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a18a5081da39014d4a6e85","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292846,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joe Frost","original_name":"Joe Frost","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a18a6c4a52f800c9951df7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4142285,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laurelle Keough","original_name":"Laurelle Keough","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a18a8981da39012c6fad71","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4142287,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christopher Martin","original_name":"Christopher Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a18aa881da39012c6fad8c","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4142288,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Polly Bide","original_name":"Polly Bide","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a18ac0c390c500eb357994","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Pilger","original_name":"John Pilger","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/jgV0P0JOkDAKLaOBEuaoRdlhFp2.jpg","credit_id":"64a18ae0d5191f00c506e60d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Pilger","original_name":"John Pilger","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/jgV0P0JOkDAKLaOBEuaoRdlhFp2.jpg","credit_id":"64a18ae581da3900ea7ce576","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1046963","wikidata_id":"Q7753731","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vw1N1xBgbYW4PHUAnhAV9TDyWZE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
