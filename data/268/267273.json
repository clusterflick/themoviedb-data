Abel Vichac has really let himself go. Though a successful writer, and supposedly working on a book about 'regret,' he is barely functioning. He can't sleep at night. During the day he is easily distracted, irresponsible and moody. He also ignores his patient live-in lover Aliette who has stuck by him for 10 years. As he mopes through another day, he gets into several awkward occasions. One of his students, Florence tells him off in a café. A young woman, Catherine hears this and afterward introduces herself as a fan. Later he decides to find her address and visit her apartment. There Abel meets Catherine's roommate Aurore and the former's jealous boyfriend Bruno for a tense scene. He is returning home when Abel encounters his brother's former lover Olga and this creates more awkwardness.","popularity":0.344,"poster_path":"/5SB5NQ5YduSOPqYYGMCunY82Lfe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55215,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paris New York Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1996-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Encore","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Berroyer","original_name":"Jackie Berroyer","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/zd5uWXdJAzVNo94ftRXEMc160ry.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Abel Vichac","credit_id":"56ea45f492514132be000c05","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeria Bruni Tedeschi","original_name":"Valeria Bruni Tedeschi","popularity":0.595,"profile_path":"/ioMCjkUWngWjS0nXWYLqvBsm4mI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Aliette","credit_id":"56ea460492514132c7000b9b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natacha Régnier","original_name":"Natacha Régnier","popularity":0.2618,"profile_path":"/ydwkoFfIbGEHuOhFRW3CYFTWgHM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Catherine","credit_id":"56ea4618c3a36815dd000bc7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélène Fillières","original_name":"Hélène Fillières","popularity":0.2468,"profile_path":"/thIjfEmxHw0bJEFBm9iefDce7zi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Aurore","credit_id":"56ea461ec3a36815dd000bca","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Côte","original_name":"Laurence Côte","popularity":0.2029,"profile_path":"/9Ze7vTkIm2X5TU48itFgRj4HWFO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Florence","credit_id":"56ea4629c3a36815df000cd8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Massé","original_name":"Michel Massé","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Thomas","credit_id":"56ea464892514166e40002a6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis-Do de Lencquesaing","original_name":"Louis-Do de Lencquesaing","popularity":0.2883,"profile_path":"/rnELz71XUPNUyJZXuyWXIHADM1U.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bruno","credit_id":"56ea465792514132be000c18","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éva Ionesco","original_name":"Éva Ionesco","popularity":0.2581,"profile_path":"/7P2YRHENz5XgmjkpKn6GumNjJxj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Olga","credit_id":"56ea4663c3a36815ea000ca0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Castel","original_name":"Lou Castel","popularity":0.2176,"profile_path":"/nfSbW6awANxaRI769Bo2ZLDb22P.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Metro salesman","credit_id":"56ea467092514132b8000c89","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64750,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pascal Bonitzer","original_name":"Pascal Bonitzer","popularity":0.4155,"profile_path":"/eVtjnCqgBi8bYowmmxQLLq4Sw4y.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bergère","credit_id":"56ea467d9251416caa0001ce","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64750,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pascal Bonitzer","original_name":"Pascal Bonitzer","popularity":0.4155,"profile_path":"/eVtjnCqgBi8bYowmmxQLLq4Sw4y.jpg","credit_id":"56ea45cdc3a36815dd000bb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0116198","wikidata_id":"Q3053824","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.746,"height":1045,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5SB5NQ5YduSOPqYYGMCunY82Lfe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"1996-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tokyo International Film Festival: Young Cinema Competition","release_date":"1996-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"European Union Film Festival","release_date":"1998-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
