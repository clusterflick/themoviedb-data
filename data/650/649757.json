Through the life of celebrated Uruguayan chef Hugo Soca—raised on his grandmother's cooking in the heart of the countryside—the film takes us on a journey through the nation's culinary traditions, from homemade wine to Pampas barbecue, simmering fish stew, and everything in between. Soca's rural upbringing and deep connection to authentic flavors have earned him the title of ambassador of Uruguayan cuisine. Shared meals, humor, and a passion for food are at the heart of this joyous celebration, beautifully captured with stunning photography.","popularity":0.0971,"poster_path":"/seFJ42Rb8G69wSp48KFwfHtxWxz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2019-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Criollo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Soca","original_name":"Hugo Soca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"610203256ee3d7002dde8548","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176893,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fernando Blanco","original_name":"Fernando Blanco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610204610a517c0027ae6fb6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176896,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicolás Kronfeld","original_name":"Nicolás Kronfeld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610204d9e9c0dc0046caa0ae","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176895,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thiago Silva","original_name":"Thiago Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610204cc4e52ed0075853e70","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Banchero","original_name":"Pablo Banchero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610203f40a517c004638ffc3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176894,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Santiago Carámbula","original_name":"Santiago Carámbula","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610204710a517c005c889566","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1807402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Federico López","original_name":"Federico López","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6102048e0cd32a002fd564d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":54583,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luciano Supervielle","original_name":"Luciano Supervielle","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610203991684f7002e171e3f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Soca","original_name":"Hugo Soca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610203db1684f70046cc9b6b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176892,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karen Jawetz","original_name":"Karen Jawetz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610203c44e52ed002ea41f10","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Banchero","original_name":"Pablo Banchero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd6bd2d3faba00013f73e88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/seFJ42Rb8G69wSp48KFwfHtxWxz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
