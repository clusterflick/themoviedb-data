After endless meetings with Government officials, they were finally given permission to wrap the Reichstag in 1994. For 7 days, in June 1995, a steel framework was constructed, then a metalized material was bound with 17, 060 yards of blue rope. The Reichstag, wrapped in this shiny material, seemed to move in the wind. Five million people visited this extraordinary project.","popularity":0.0755,"poster_path":"/oPXFEuFXF1VXb7esNbKeSpk7Jpm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christo & Jeanne-Claude: Wrapped Reichstag, Berlin 1971-1995","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Friedrich G.
