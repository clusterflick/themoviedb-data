The cast features American soprano Kristin Lewis who has been heralded for her remarkable voice, which she uses with powerful dramatic instinct, and Georgian mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili, whose Amneris dominates the stage with her dark, rounded, irresistible voice and extraordinary stage presence. Gianandrea Noseda leading the Orchestra and Chorus Teatro Regio Torino received accolaides from all: he controls everything- orchestra, singers, chorus, dancers, acrobats- with an all-encompassing overview. He knows exactly when its time to linger over a timbre, a color, an expressive chord.","popularity":0.3547,"poster_path":"/eFJOUm1hOfQnMeiiRstF7wN2nAh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":148,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verdi Aida","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2140473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristin Lewis","original_name":"Kristin Lewis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/3and4js8sGIffrc77GzZffEV4eE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Aida","credit_id":"5dd5bdcb3faba00019f52a9d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Berti","original_name":"Marco Berti","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/cxL4C3YHDYxoxltWcFrRb1pAUXE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Radames","credit_id":"5dd5be9328723c001450673b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Rachvelishvili","original_name":"Anita Rachvelishvili","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":"/cMi64qXbFqHwruuUuuoK6owBCFy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Amneris","credit_id":"5dd5becb28723c00125000ec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1567638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giacomo Prestia","original_name":"Giacomo Prestia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8KewbySeXhfGzZDnzf5WZYYis5h.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ramfis","credit_id":"5dd5bf042634620012b827ea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2462882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark S.
