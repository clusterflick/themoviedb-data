If he completes them all, including teaching himself to become a karate black belt, he believes his father will return on Christmas. Jesse's sophisticated, workaholic mother, Abby, believes her husband was lost in the shooting, but has a glimmer of hope through visions that Jesse reports to her. After Abby enlists the aid of an eccentric psychic-turned-law professor, a roller coaster thriller ensues, where the trio unravel a mystery that no one expected - and maybe, just maybe witness the delivery of a miracle that can only happen on Christmas.","popularity":1.2321,"poster_path":"/5flrxSXflIyIa113dVWTXT1xDRP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It
