For the title role of Cyrus, Rossini wrote what would be his longest-ever contralto role, to which the great Rossini singer Ewa Podles´ is both naturally attracted and ideally suited. She is partnered by two young stars of Rossini singing, Jessica Pratt and Michael Spyres, and a conductor-scholar, Will Crutchfield, of great experience and sympathy. Filmed in High Definition and recorded in true Surround Sound.","popularity":0.1272,"poster_path":"/nlmAHbFz42hEEUeJfinY89ngm6y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":122225,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rossini Opera Festival","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ciro in Babilonia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2153831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Spyres","original_name":"Michael Spyres","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/ynfY9zhWR1edrzjvCmwg4Ml7B5Q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Baldassare","credit_id":"5dd6cbfe7f1d83001863158a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1572006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ewa Podleś","original_name":"Ewa Podleś","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":"/iiSeh5W96PV1UFsWop23dOYZu2d.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ciro","credit_id":"5dd6cc217f1d83001562c60c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1682064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Pratt","original_name":"Jessica Pratt","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":"/r3MXm90D0oLXigPC7zk9ctVQC68.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Amira","credit_id":"5dd6cc3f12aabc00168c7fb5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Romeu","original_name":"Carmen Romeu","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Argene","credit_id":"5dd6cc5912aabc00168c7fe2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirco Palazzi","original_name":"Mirco Palazzi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Zambri","credit_id":"5dd6cc6e7f1d83001562c6c8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert McPherson","original_name":"Robert McPherson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Arbace","credit_id":"5dd6cc847f1d830013628d42","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raffaele Costantin","original_name":"Raffaele Costantin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Daniello","credit_id":"5dd6cc96af85de00137e6d0c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Crutchfield","original_name":"Will Crutchfield","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5dd6cccb12aabc00138c73c0","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2043700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davide Livermore","original_name":"Davide Livermore","popularity":0.0473,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd6ce4812aabc00168c8117","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463517,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Aventi","original_name":"Francesco Aventi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd6ceaa12aabc00118c721a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nlmAHbFz42hEEUeJfinY89ngm6y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
