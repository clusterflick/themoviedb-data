The works are complemented solely with Bacon’s own words, recorded by Derek Jacobi. The artist’s biography is outlined, but the focus is on his ideas: his thoughts about his work, his reflections about how and why he paints. The result is a rigorous and revealing portrait of one of the few artists who has truly changed the way we see and understand ourselves.","popularity":0.2615,"poster_path":"/9RG3rhOJ3bGf5mT96m9Zpircxuk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Francis Bacon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek Jacobi","original_name":"Derek Jacobi","popularity":1.0856,"profile_path":"/htc4eCYmNlVotcu8AFTbDiLBzsJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Derek Jacobi","credit_id":"5dd74d9e8566d200151ed642","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258217,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Wyver","original_name":"John Wyver","popularity":0.0556,"profile_path":"/yHuOcIl8fCdfpHJlkEHT85cnssX.jpg","credit_id":"6570b8e09ac53501f13268ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4416466,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sam Flynn","original_name":"Sam Flynn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6570b8e6c7a7e000e2dc8b59","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27867161","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3DYcSarR2L5HZrkkZOsg18rN6JS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9RG3rhOJ3bGf5mT96m9Zpircxuk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
