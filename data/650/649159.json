After getting married, she takes Seongman with her to study in France, of which she had long been preparing. In France, the only thing Seongman could do was housework. Not being able to read or speak the language, Seongman suffers from depression, when Areum, the one responsible for their financial and administrative duties, gets pregnant. In order to help Seongman get over his depression, Areum suggests that they start running “Oegil Restaurant”, a project to cook and serve to a limited number of guests on specific days. However, after the birth of their baby, Areum starts concentrating on her studies and film-making, leaving Seongman parenting alone. This leads to frequent aggressive fights, and Seongman declares a strike. Will Areum be able to succeed in juggling both her marriage and film?","popularity":0.0738,"poster_path":"/pjf9PIlgly5aAV4GRl7368qU2aM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Why did I get married?","title":"Areum Married","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Parkkangareum gyeolhonhada","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2461678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"ParkKang A-reum","original_name":"ParkKang A-reum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60feae9b7ad08c0046eaa4da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3682657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeong Seong-man","original_name":"Jeong Seong-man","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"정성만","credit_id":"630e6671a39d0b0092310005","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2146270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Lang","original_name":"Lee Lang","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/lWIeqrWVAVPGzZjSHHHcJrV2ScX.jpg","credit_id":"604cc8401d53860072769fac","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2461678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"ParkKang A-reum","original_name":"ParkKang A-reum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604cc96d4284ea0073196ba9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2461678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"ParkKang A-reum","original_name":"ParkKang A-reum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604cc9771d5386007276a168","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2461678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"ParkKang A-reum","original_name":"ParkKang A-reum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd366c157d3780015dd2c9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15560660","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":833,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t6jx7bnMYZESiiYZ7oYu2pZTa2L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1481}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1265,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pjf9PIlgly5aAV4GRl7368qU2aM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":843},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nt2h3nsvoZ1fasJnLi2e5L5mKH1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/kx7FeOyx8Vk3QnRkYL9HX62IxBw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":953}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"Seoul International Women’s Film Festival","release_date":"2019-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"ALL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer | 박강아름 결혼하다 AREUM MARRIED","key":"349712992","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-07-23T17:27:21.000Z","id":"615d160feb14fa008c19710b"}]}}}
