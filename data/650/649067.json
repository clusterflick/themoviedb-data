It had been kept in the Syrian town of Aleppo for centuries and was smuggled in the 1950s to Israel, where it was revealed that 200 pages had gone missing. A cheese merchant, a murdered antiques dealer, Mossad agents and Israel’s second president are all implicated in the decades-long mystery. This gripping documentary is an attempt to find the lost pages as well as the soul of the once unified Aleppian Jewish community.","popularity":0.3085,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Crown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Avi Dabach","original_name":"Avi Dabach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd2c9c8fd6fa100148180d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Avi Dabach","original_name":"Avi Dabach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd2c9d0fd6fa1001881a0df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461301,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gil Ramon","original_name":"Gil Ramon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd2c9defd6fa100148180e6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8521316","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":235499,"name":"10th century"},{"id":339209,"name":"jewish bible"},{"id":339210,"name":"aleppo codex"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
