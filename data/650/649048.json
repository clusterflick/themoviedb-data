With very little hope left, he yearns for support. His prayers are answered when he is assigned to a school project dealing with his disease. He battles with this because of his partner, Kevin, a bully & his desire to keep his illness a secret. However, through this experience he finds hope because of a potential cure for his disease. His hope is met with fear from his mom, support from his friend Carrie and uncertainty from within. The question he asks himself is “What if God is waiting on me to act for myself and not just me expecting Him to do it all?”","popularity":0.2341,"poster_path":"/qycmUnJtCbQp13YNAWLr4pCpULH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walk By Faith","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabiola Barragan","original_name":"Fabiola Barragan","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mandy","credit_id":"5dd2bce5fd6fa10014817149","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaelynn Blount","original_name":"Jaelynn Blount","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Board Member","credit_id":"5dd2bcfb356a710012eb216e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3896559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Bradley","original_name":"James Bradley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"C.E.O.
