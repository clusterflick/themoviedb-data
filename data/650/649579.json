Through the use of miniature cameras mounted on trained eagles (a vantage point by definition), this aery documentary soars over areas of transit and surveillance, intertwining the birds’ migratory routes with the refugees’ desperate journey into the unknown. A vis-à-vis juxtaposition of human rule vs. nature’s law, which –in all its cruel simplicity– offers a sense of equality that cuts across dividing lines.","popularity":0.1143,"poster_path":"/2U79B5CrtJlwxgSydzzKzpwJOXl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Invisible Hand Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2020-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Above the Law","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2462832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryony Dunne","original_name":"Bryony Dunne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd5a4e328723c00145048f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cara Holmes","original_name":"Cara Holmes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6f6cc6c849200212abbb7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2462832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryony Dunne","original_name":"Bryony Dunne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6f6beae2811001f3c2b68","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2462832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryony Dunne","original_name":"Bryony Dunne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6f6b7140bad001b1838c2","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2445974,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robin Sherrywood","original_name":"Robin Sherrywood","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6f6d6e635710020cd1689","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1756737,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brendan Rehill","original_name":"Brendan Rehill","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6f6e05a5ed00020443f7c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2026941,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patrick Campbell","original_name":"Patrick Campbell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6f6f28e2e00002124704c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1680600,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Emma Scott","original_name":"Emma Scott","popularity":0.1937,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6f6ff0fb17f001d7b1bda","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2U79B5CrtJlwxgSydzzKzpwJOXl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki Documentary Festival","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
