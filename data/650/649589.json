The only surviving record of his hazardous mission are a few telegrams he sent to the home front. Directors Feargal Ward and Adrian Duncan literally follow in his footsteps in this tough trek through the subarctic wilderness, captured in dreamlike, hallucinatory scenes. The fantastic soundscape with high-pitched, sparse tones only intensifies the sense of desolation and mystery.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2019-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memory Room","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Feargal Ward","original_name":"Feargal Ward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/unDYejjQrOlhGWgLjwvLKt2mrOH.jpg","credit_id":"5dd5aa9b2634620016b81a6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2462855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Duncan","original_name":"Adrian Duncan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd5aaaf28723c00124fe5a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"67.
