Orlando Venneck is a beloved settler in the area and, like his ancestors, he is a hunter. Sara Voguel, a committed rural doctor, is married to Guzmán and used to be Venneck’s fiancee. Both venerate the mountain in their own way, but a jaguar appears and this generates a confrontation between them. Behind the tourist postcard of the park hides a world besieged by passions, conflicts of interest and fights. The spiral of violence will become inevitable and blood will flow.","popularity":0.2395,"poster_path":"/zHxFXGykNIUqAWLxsZkN4ictX0M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34073,"logo_path":null,"name":"Doménica
