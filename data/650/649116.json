Portugal and Spain, distant by fragments of their memories, images, objects, voices and ruins. Time runs out... An anxiety floats above the border and also a strength of believing that it is possible to change some things until the very last minute of our cross-over. In a world of contradictions, inequalities remain, existing surprising stories in almost forgotten lands. We are standing before a jigsaw puzzle organized into a map of ideas and memories.","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":"/7hMLgE27MSMYq13aUz6o0zwWxNb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vo'Arte","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2011-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"pt.es","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278950,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ana Rita Barata","original_name":"Ana Rita Barata","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61713ac3cadb6b00439129ae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278957,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nuno Bouça","original_name":"Nuno Bouça","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61713bec13a3200044e599f8","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Advisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Sena Nunes","original_name":"Pedro Sena Nunes","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/w3zHCVlmaVXrm039fvJaHRa9L4.jpg","credit_id":"61713aa90d5d8500915ae032","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278956,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vando Enes","original_name":"Vando Enes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61713bb10d5d850043716662","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278954,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maribel Espinal","original_name":"Maribel Espinal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61713b63894ed6006469ba81","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278952,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Filipe Chagas","original_name":"Filipe Chagas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61713b1fdf86a80023e95585","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278954,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maribel Espinal","original_name":"Maribel Espinal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61713c09fd7aa400660e6e5c","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278953,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nuno Costa","original_name":"Nuno Costa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61713b3e5c5cc80065ba52d2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278955,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cristina Brum","original_name":"Cristina Brum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61713b7c1d019100441b02cf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1181512,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Miguel Robalo","original_name":"Miguel Robalo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61713af5cadb6b0062d10dbd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Sena Nunes","original_name":"Pedro Sena Nunes","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/w3zHCVlmaVXrm039fvJaHRa9L4.jpg","credit_id":"5dd3108dc995ee00150d7827","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2175500","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1191,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7hMLgE27MSMYq13aUz6o0zwWxNb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":842}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
