They are touring Crowd, Gisèle Vienne's dance piece on the 90s rave scene. Following them from theatre to theatre, the film documents their work as well as their strange, intimate relationships.

Little by little dance grows into a troubling journey into our nights, our parties, our loves.","popularity":0.3108,"poster_path":"/g26t6GpxcETe9b3gVxicPQA8KYX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7059,"logo_path":"/xVFZ1RvZNvAMe7vGH8369fNW0bP.png","name":"Aurora
