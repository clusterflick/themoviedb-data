Made at a time when the city was experiencing unprecedented real estate development on the one hand and unforeseen displacement of population and deterioration on the other. Empire City is the story of two New Yorks. The film explores the precarious coexistence of the service-based midtown Manhattan corporate headquarters with the peripheral New York of undereducated minorities living in increasing alienation.","popularity":1.3239,"poster_path":"/ggaPle58xiNc8Rgn7GIxBlHvBYR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Blackwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The City That Never Sleeps","title":"Empire City","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Trump","original_name":"Donald Trump","popularity":1.675,"profile_path":"/nkQrZELEgxsvwDSlYkNfpFmsFx4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dd34e10b39e3500188bec42","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Koch","original_name":"Ed Koch","popularity":0.1559,"profile_path":"/xiYbexdeDIUJnhCmh8gFKo6tAVF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dd34e1c28723c00174cbc75","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1807640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Jacobs","original_name":"Jane Jacobs","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dd34e5dfd6fa10018827eb9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elia Kazan","original_name":"Elia Kazan","popularity":0.4026,"profile_path":"/4Hu3AoSEYrdgzwkwYu7ry683uFj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dd34e71356a710017ec538d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Mailer","original_name":"Norman Mailer","popularity":0.3322,"profile_path":"/k3WaFdSl9OAi1BjFO4h4RniEjeL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dd34e8157d3780018dcd6b2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36208,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arthur Miller","original_name":"Arthur Miller","popularity":0.3305,"profile_path":"/ttjDqWZkHbAWImK2yZq06UFWBVq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dd34e9228723c00144ce3df","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Robards","original_name":"Jason Robards","popularity":0.9616,"profile_path":"/9y0HAtWWBkB02gVzh8QDdz6UYZH.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Self -
