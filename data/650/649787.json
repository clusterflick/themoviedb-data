It shows how fascism was on the rise even a decade before the founding of the NSB, due to a number of anti-democratic initiatives led by a millionaire with a predilection for one-legged women, a market vendor, a cleric, and an artist. Historians, writers and collectors of fascist curios reveal how an initially marginal and fragmented movement grew into a radical populist party.","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":"/4vPvHc7nu54fnIVtYMxYnWmmis9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An archeology of fascism in the Netherlands","title":"All Against All","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaap Spijkers","original_name":"Jaap Spijkers","popularity":0.2075,"profile_path":"/thi1QOTdsGmUW13e6aXkQrQmDFs.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5e7d3fa3eec4f30547aa1555","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":211304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Drost","original_name":"Peter Drost","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/wp9sdz9nvx0V0bjtX8OClGUd5k0.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5e7d3f98109dec1cbb026c52","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2446831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mauro Canali","original_name":"Mauro Canali","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e7d3ea8fea0d710f5c902b6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benito Mussolini","original_name":"Benito Mussolini","popularity":0.3386,"profile_path":"/rizo5Ct0esQP4gQmisdJ2FkkZhq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e7d3f04ab1bc75874c2fb4e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Hitler","original_name":"Adolf Hitler","popularity":0.7926,"profile_path":"/n6f81IUSes1a8jTzUIF7rJ5zZnP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e7d3f14fea0d708fec93339","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinrich Himmler","original_name":"Heinrich Himmler","popularity":0.3017,"profile_path":"/Aljparz5AOPTPrgVFDFahutWBak.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e7d3f2713a32046b7281937","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2822968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Mussert","original_name":"Anton Mussert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5f8f021711386c484ffe6d38","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2822970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnold Meijer","original_name":"Arnold Meijer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5f8f028f89f749003905adc3","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luuk Bouwman","original_name":"Luuk Bouwman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd6ec5712aabc00118ca3ff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luuk Bouwman","original_name":"Luuk Bouwman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd6ec5128723c001452ddb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Pieter Tuinstra","original_name":"Jan Pieter Tuinstra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7d3f5cfea0d772afc936a0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":107851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bram Meindersma","original_name":"Bram Meindersma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7d3f7f13a32046b7281a49","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291822,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Barbara Hin","original_name":"Barbara Hin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7d3f71eec4f34267a9e1de","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11238482","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4vPvHc7nu54fnIVtYMxYnWmmis9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1755,"name":"fascism"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"14","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IDFA","release_date":"2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
