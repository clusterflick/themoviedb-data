Anna Sokolow can be seen on the lower left of the frame.  Based on the script found in Shirley Clarke's collection, this looks to be a complete version of Ms. Sokolow's choreography for Act One of the film.  Plot subtitles are taken from Shirley Clarke's script.  Pierrot and Pierrette's duet transformed into Shirley Clarke's 1957 dance film 'A Moment in Love'.","popularity":0.0781,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rose and the Players â€“ Part 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Chandler","original_name":"Jeff Chandler","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pierrot","credit_id":"5dd6dd48b5bc210016c1e813","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1489138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmela Gutierrez","original_name":"Carmela Gutierrez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Pierrette","credit_id":"5dd6dd537f1d83001562dd41","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eve Beck","original_name":"Eve Beck","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Columbine","credit_id":"5dd6dd6128723c18ad516010","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1489139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Sanasardo","original_name":"Paul Sanasardo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Harlequin","credit_id":"5dd6dd69af85de00137e8cc3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1388298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wendy Clarke","original_name":"Wendy Clarke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Little Pierrette","credit_id":"5dd6dd7412aabc00138c939f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald White","original_name":"Donald White","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Little Pierrot","credit_id":"5dd6dd817f1d83001362a483","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lello","original_name":"Lello","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Pantaloon","credit_id":"5dd6ddbdb5bc210011c214ec","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205670,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anna Sokolow","original_name":"Anna Sokolow","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5dd6de79b5bc210011c216f3","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shirley Clarke","original_name":"Shirley Clarke","popularity":0.2233,"profile_path":"/8GI3B7YW6Cv87hetfp17zNX4d5A.jpg","credit_id":"5dd6dd0628723c18ad515f44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205670,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anna Sokolow","original_name":"Anna Sokolow","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd6dd10b5bc210013c1e9e1","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463562,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Sweeney","original_name":"John Sweeney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd6dd1d12aabc00138c931f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Part of 'The Magic Box: The Films of Shirley Clarke, 1929-1987'","release_date":"2016-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
