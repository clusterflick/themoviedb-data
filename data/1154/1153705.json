New evidence suggests that we are a race with amnesia and that we are only now beginning to comprehend the truth to our ancient origins. From ancient Greece, to the remote Pacific Ocean, from holy relics, to Neolithic monuments, much of what was known, what was found, and what was built, is now shrouded in legend and myth.  We will unravel the secrets of ancient stone circles and monoliths, discover the truth behind the enigmatic Easter Island, the mystery of the death of Alexander the Great, explore the wonder of the Shroud of Turin and the Knights Templar and delve deep into the extraterrestrial files and ancient aliens.","popularity":0.0779,"poster_path":"/1pWl5P2vqzLGxLbqsgXAXU4dhIT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ancient World Exposed: We Are a Race with Amnesia","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Gardiner","original_name":"Philip Gardiner","popularity":0.147,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b72e565aadc40139d0f5ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1296,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1pWl5P2vqzLGxLbqsgXAXU4dhIT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":864}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
