Like august flies, trying to escape certain death, people before the apocalypse started to copulate, until every single one was completely exhausted.  Only two people remained untouched. Having merged, like Salmacis and Hermaphroditus, in music that gave them eternal life, they wander timeless, empty spaces. Their destiny - to save humanity. But humanity means nothing to them.  Main characters of the movie, Kirill Shirokov and Sasha Elina, are real musicians and founders of 'the same' ensemble, specialized in performing quite music related to certain space and time. During the film they perform music from ‘every day melodies’ series composed by Kirill Shirokov.  The movie is the first part of mini-series discovering the territory of contemporary art music.","popularity":0.2254,"poster_path":"/AmbiUXlXZbW4xyMzmv71BfXfwKW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"And
