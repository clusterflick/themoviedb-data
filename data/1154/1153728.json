The first paratrooper unit was raised in 1935 following the profound impression made upon the Germans by the early experiments with this new form of warfare conducted by the Soviets. This programme deals with the evolution of the paratrooper arm, and goes into depth about their important role in the invasion of the West in 1940.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tzGeeMpNly2JBIClaEtcqXTkh4t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green Devils: German Paratrooper Elite 1933-1941","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1203,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o1vOnoFi8iXxz4lO108XWZQOf6C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2140}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1308,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tzGeeMpNly2JBIClaEtcqXTkh4t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":872}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
