One of the highest-selling productions in A.C.T. history, this is the first time the original production, captured before a live audience in June 2011, will be seen by the public—streaming for one week only to celebrate San Francisco Pride, June 21–27, 2021. Audiences around the world will finally get to hear Mary Ann, Mona, Brian, Mouse, and their joint-rolling landlady Mrs. Madrigal sing their Tales of the city. Based on Maupin’s landmark series of novels about San Francisco in the 70s, and featuring a cast of Broadway favorites, the acclaimed musical was directed by Jason Moore (The Cher Show, Avenue Q, Pitch Perfect), featured music and lyrics by the Scissor Sisters’s Jake Shears and John Garden, and a book by Tony Award winner Jeff Whitty (Avenue Q).","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wlIOB8ctastFDV9m5PD4hBN12qR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City the Musical","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wlIOB8ctastFDV9m5PD4hBN12qR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
