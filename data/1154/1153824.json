During the war, new names were written large in world history; names such as the International Brigade and the Nationalist General Franco, who lead his side to ultimate victory. Featuring fascinating archive film and location footage, plus dramatised 'eye-witness' accounts, 'The Spanish Civil War' is an intriguing account of a dark and divided period of Spanish history.  With many photographic images plus interviews with surviving members of the International Brigade, the programme also features expert interpretation and analysis to provide historical and political background to the war.","popularity":0.124,"poster_path":"/32JAGFsrga3TcceYymHvpiVQouY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The History of Warfare: The Spanish Civil War","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Leighton","original_name":"Mike Leighton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64b79edbd399e600ca9071cc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Carruthers","original_name":"Bob Carruthers","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/vWqpErkseOgbYYiKoc0VvmEvHDX.jpg","credit_id":"64b79f24109cd0010183ac27","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Leighton","original_name":"Mike Leighton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b79f40eee18600e3725db8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Leighton","original_name":"Mike Leighton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b79f355aadc400e2978616","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Leighton","original_name":"Mike Leighton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b79f4db1f68d00c8ff8cd5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1068,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9lAmaMTDIrt1u6uEbBUv6LSpeDU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1900}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1375,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/32JAGFsrga3TcceYymHvpiVQouY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":915}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
