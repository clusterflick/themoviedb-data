The film contains military footage of the twentieth century, never included in the official chronicles. The so-called \"cuts\" are, as a rule, of a \"household\" nature. The film is an image of a huge and hopeless war, where men wander through the twentieth century, where there is no front line, where the war turns into a mass sexual perversion that destroys the very logic of human existence.","popularity":0.0534,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1993-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cuts of Another War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Mansky","original_name":"Виталий Манский","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/lfuKoHM7F4SKjnQjQWoO6yUM8jg.jpg","credit_id":"64b6adaa3780620139088080","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
