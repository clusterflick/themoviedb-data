It is a little known fact, but rare colour photographs of the Great War were produced by pioneers of colour photography at work on both sides of the lines. In 1903, the French brothers Auguste and Louis Lumiere patented the colour photography process and pioneered colour photography. On the German side of the line was the famous photographer Hans Hildenbrand. This powerful documentary brings those rare images to light. Of course the story of the Great War wasn't just recorded in photographs.  The war artists both official and unofficial on both sides were able to present a vivid picture of the world as it really was, in full colour. This documentary film also features a remarkable and comprehensive record of the Great War as viewed through the eyes of the war artists.","popularity":0.1371,"poster_path":"/mhSxn8h7s3xjeA8MteKd25tacIS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great War in Colour","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4169591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kingsley Glover","original_name":"Kingsley Glover","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"64b7422f5aadc4011c0b92cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":152103,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julian Spilsbury","original_name":"Julian Spilsbury","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64b74248d399e6014e5da921","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Carruthers","original_name":"Bob Carruthers","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/vWqpErkseOgbYYiKoc0VvmEvHDX.jpg","credit_id":"64b742865aadc400c58a6867","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nVJYydTiSrJnytCCphbgk2aS5hT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1436,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mhSxn8h7s3xjeA8MteKd25tacIS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1019}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
