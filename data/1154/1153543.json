The Red Army reached the Dnieper borders, crossed the Dnieper and liberated Kiev. Crossed the Dnieper and Mikola. On the Dnieper, he was wounded – an enemy fragment injured his knee. Since then, Mikola can walk very slowly and only with a wand. Now he lives on the outskirts of the city of Mena, in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine. He is not the only men's veteran – the veteran movement has always been developed here, monuments stood in almost every village, Eternal lights burned ... Now the events of those distant years have been forgotten in a series of today's problems. But for Men's veterans, May 9 is still the main day of the calendar.","popularity":0.0612,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2013-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eternal Flame","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Mansky","original_name":"Виталий Манский","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/lfuKoHM7F4SKjnQjQWoO6yUM8jg.jpg","credit_id":"64b6cb3e0e4fc8519fecf137","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
