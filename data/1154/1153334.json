In this new publication, Michael Meredith, Assistant Professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, tackles the problems facing the discipline head-on, interrogating its internal dynamics and searching for a mode of practice that can survive amid the confusing, conflicting demands of contemporary culture. Nominally addressed to students entering the field, \"Notes for those beginning the discipline of architecture\" is a scathing take on the profession from one of its emerging young practitioners, outlining its pitfalls, its excruciating failures, and in spite of it all its undeniable potentials.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/zk3RnryfBc7r1eNcz7Wo3JsGgqK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes for Those Beginning the Discipline of Architecture - Alternate Ending 1 : the Glimmering Noise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4168107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Norstrom","original_name":"David Norstrom","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64b6275837806200ad1613be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4168104,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Meredith","original_name":"Michael Meredith","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"670c27473bb4557c669bc211","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4168104,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Meredith","original_name":"Michael Meredith","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b626f2ac416101391d07fc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1149163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Fenster","original_name":"David Fenster","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b626ac0bb07600eb2a4e5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zk3RnryfBc7r1eNcz7Wo3JsGgqK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
