'Maria' tells the story of one woman's journey from birth to death through the Soviet engineered famine of the 1930's that left millions dead. Documenting the creative process in their new environment here in the UK, the cast - all well known actors in their home country - recount their own powerful stories of loss and overcoming the odds, in a moving documentary filmed over the course of a month of rehearsals and performance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Playing for Ukraine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27831378","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
