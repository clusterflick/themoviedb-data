He was 42 years old. He did not die in a duel like Pushkin and Lermontov, did not fall from a bullet and a noose like Mayakovsky and Yesenin. The cause of his death was no less dramatic. Vysotsky struggled with death for a long time. But by the beginning of 1980, this duel turned into a fierce fight. After 25 years, we present the first documentary evidence of this struggle. Everyone has the right to their own judgment about the death of a great poet, but no one's judgment can claim absolute truth. According to eyewitnesses, after the meeting of the new 1980, Vysotsky's disease began to progress and turned into a real agony. We will reconstruct the events with chronological accuracy from January 1 up to July 25, 1980. In our film, people who knew Vysotsky intimately in the last year of his life tell us.","popularity":0.077,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2005-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death of the Poet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2227124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Darfy","original_name":"Olga Darfy","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b6c67578570e00c6d61218","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Mansky","original_name":"Виталий Манский","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/lfuKoHM7F4SKjnQjQWoO6yUM8jg.jpg","credit_id":"64b6c67f3780620139088aac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Mansky","original_name":"Виталий Манский","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/lfuKoHM7F4SKjnQjQWoO6yUM8jg.jpg","credit_id":"64b6c6863780620139088aaf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
