I'm DINNER. The rest of the cast is my Uncle Mike, and Brother Brian. Mike continues to write and act. And I continue to film and do stupid things on camera. This was made about 1984. Having a video camera and a light was amazing. Took 1 to hold the vcr thing, 1 to hold the light and 1 to hold the camera!  I'm in the process of trying to organize a re-boot of this movie. But finding people hasn't gone well. Will keep trying.\" â€“Gregg Cerenzio","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wU2lPDggfsdtfZ1BrqvEulweyMb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wharton Thriller","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4169625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Morano","original_name":"Mike Morano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b744d3eee186013a654417","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wU2lPDggfsdtfZ1BrqvEulweyMb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
