The signal was converted in Moscow to the European broadcast system, traveled to Helsinki and then to London, England, where it was converted to the North American pattern, and then to Mill Village Nova Scotia. In order to provide you with an authentic copy of this historic game, the recording you are watching has been digitally enhanced, yet remains identical to the original broadcast twenty-five years ago. Please be aware that there were brief satellite disruptions during the original broadcast. This is not a defect in the tape - do not adjust your TV or VCR.","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":"/arsIKwrjhrQRTd7Un0oFukJJLdC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17992,"logo_path":"/wbnyYL2QhDn8KWuz5htsbOJnVLA.png","name":"PolyGram Video","origin_country":""},{"id":204398,"logo_path":null,"name":"Architectus","origin_country":""},{"id":204399,"logo_path":null,"name":"tv eye","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Game 8 - Canada vs. U.S.S.R.","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4169172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Foster Hewitt","original_name":"Foster Hewitt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Commentary","credit_id":"64b6f8b4f6fd1800f1082bf1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3695104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Conacher","original_name":"Brian Conacher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/giIAtuAbeMHPpIx7j9iyteNxIWK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Commentary","credit_id":"64b6f8c315794a00ff057ddd","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/arsIKwrjhrQRTd7Un0oFukJJLdC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8zd9n9JSxzDS77HdMeaYzUhVGEt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/46pdZBRmnp3GDCB0E14NErI8fNB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pg0EN95vuMxLOJcUcyNJsAqyB4T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Ai6U0ZDMJLRyKM9WOdBgAYrrz1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"VHS","release_date":"1997-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
