They've enjoyed huge popular hits that include \"So Into You\", \"Champagne Jam\", \"Imaginary Lover\", \"Not Gonna Let it Bother Me Tonight\", and \"Spooky\" - but there's so much more! With 15 albums of outstanding songwriting and performances to their credit, The Atlanta Rhythm Section represents all the good things the phrase \"classic rock\" implies.  In December 2003, the \"Georgia Rhythm\" traveled to Bethlehem, PA for a unique performance at Stabler Arena, a 6,000-seat high-tech concert arena located on the campus of Lehigh University. Joining ARS and the high-spirited crowd at this seasonal event was a camera crew and a mobile digital multitrack audio recording unit from Rolling Storm Communications Corporation - a production company that's collaborated with ARS on various projects over the years.","popularity":0.1521,"poster_path":"/hNAdvQZWzBqjfb0zy26ADXOP3SW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":204390,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Atlanta Rhythm Section","origin_country":""},{"id":204391,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rolling Storm Communications Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Atlanta Rhythm Section -
