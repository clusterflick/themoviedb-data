Immortal Stories is an exploration of those hidden zones of great cities haunted by literary ideas and characters. It depicts the endless wandering of an artist undergoing an increasingly detached and disjointed experience of contemporary life. In this latest feature-length work, documentarian and critic Fergus Daly again negotiates the intersection of art, cinema and philosophy.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1AJHqKV9s3YJ4KxA9QAZaImNf4L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Immortal Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fergus Daly","original_name":"Fergus Daly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b6a8290e4fc8519ebb418a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28283558","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2235,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1AJHqKV9s3YJ4KxA9QAZaImNf4L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Cork Film Festival","release_date":"2015-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
