One of the first TV presenters. She was called the All-Union \"Aunt Valya\". The peak of Leontieva's fame came in the late 1960s - early 1970s, when she led the program adored by the people \"From the bottom of her heart.\" And besides, there were festive concerts \"Blue light\", popular children's programs \"Visiting a fairy tale\", \"Good night, kids\", \"Skillful Hands\", \"Alarm Clock\"... Leontieva's story about herself in the film is illustrated by film and TV newsreels, photographs of her personal archive. But even the most vivid memories of former glory cannot drown out the pain and longing. Valentina Mikhailovna appears in front of the audience in a housecoat and slippers. The poor atmosphere, the unpretentious decoration of her home, and most importantly, the genuine sadness in her eyes and voice indicate that the once beloved and irreplaceable Aunt Valya was undeservedly forgotten.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":"/7PDVLNLq7l7LuJSRyFcgZ9uv6T1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2003-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valentina Leontieva","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Mansky","original_name":"Виталий Манский","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/lfuKoHM7F4SKjnQjQWoO6yUM8jg.jpg","credit_id":"64b6bc550e4fc851a0f50c68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7PDVLNLq7l7LuJSRyFcgZ9uv6T1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
