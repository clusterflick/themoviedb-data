In self-reflexive scenes, the character-actors in Killing the Muse explore the art of filmmaking, sexuality, and their personal circumstances. How much does their art reflect their personal lives? Where and what are the boundaries of each? Killing the Muse proves to be intriguing and engrossing, mind-bending, and often funny.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/naQwYiJHUaXDXicMOKwqRGd1vkb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":204444,"logo_path":null,"name":"Must See Pictures Orgel Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2023-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every breath is the muse","title":"Killing the Muse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nana Akuzawa","original_name":"Nana Akuzawa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Shizuki/Muse/Steve","credit_id":"64b80408eee186013a65a123","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kozue Ito","original_name":"Kozue Ito","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Masami/Producer","credit_id":"64b8041d109cd000e4e9a277","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chika Kinoshita","original_name":"Chika Kinoshita","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Megumi/Assistant Director","credit_id":"64b80434a8067300c8d1a872","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naoki Kondo","original_name":"Naoki Kondo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Makoto/Steve/Assistant","credit_id":"64b80548a8067300aef8c2e9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven J Martin","original_name":"Steven J Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8045bfdc14600c6dc9f42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170424,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steven J Martin","original_name":"Steven J Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b80468109cd0013b02c42f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170425,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kozue Ito","original_name":"Kozue Ito","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b80473a806730106840256","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170426,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Duain Cameron","original_name":"Duain Cameron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b80481eee186011dc4b922","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170427,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shota Uchiyama","original_name":"Shota Uchiyama","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b804915aadc400e297b26d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170428,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryoma Miki","original_name":"Ryoma Miki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8049d55b0c00139b6bcfa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170429,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jennings Smith","original_name":"Jennings Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b804bba8067300e7626e0e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt24222864","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1541,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/naQwYiJHUaXDXicMOKwqRGd1vkb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1113},{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1541,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9sbiOqNsJCfc9zonW0xOC3aMWFy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1113}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
