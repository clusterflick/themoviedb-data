All through his life Brennan has been dead set against the idea of falling in love forever. It never worked for anyone close to him. His Mum and Dad split up after four decades. His brother and sister are recently divorced (from different people) and after almost 70 years of marriage even his nanna and grandad parted ways (but that was mainly due todeath). For Brennan, love wasn’t for him… until suddenly, it was.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brennan Reece - Evermore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
