Reviewers would determine if the films contained any scenes that they deemed to be indecent, immoral, inhumane, sacrilegious or likely to incite a crime. Over 44 years more than 73,000 films were evaluated and thousands of scenes were censored. For almost half of the last century, movie goers in New York saw only what the government allowed them to see. Governing Body is composed entirely of scenes that were censored through this process.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Governing Body","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Weist","original_name":"Julia Weist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6500c138db4ed610343fc7ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Weist","original_name":"Julia Weist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6500c13f5545ca00fea6cee1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
