We’re taken through various sketches, from a new dating app to a spin on Beauty and the Beast. The Stephen King sketch is brilliant, as is the wild west interpretation of Facebook. There are bad puns and there’s a lot of mischievous banter, all performed with a childish cheekiness that is both annoying and infectious. We have the beautiful privilege of being welcomed into their invincible friendship, something that makes the whole thing feel incredibly effortless.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Britney - Friends & Nothing More","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
