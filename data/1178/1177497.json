Siqueiros’ América Tropical in the late 1960s up to the adoption of conservation by the Getty Conservation Institute in 1990. It also reexamines the role of art in society, freedom of expression and the nature and impact of censorship.\r Through characters, emotion and conflict, the film weaves the uplifting story of the revival of a ghost mural whose artistic qualities and message are still relevant today.","popularity":0.0617,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":205478,"logo_path":null,"name":"Barefoot Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"América Tropical: Seeing the Light of Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"America Tropical: Seeing the Light of Day","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"America Tropical","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1988154,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Milenko Skoknic","original_name":"Milenko Skoknic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6501058edb4ed61032a79f3b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630514,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pedro Pablo Celedón","original_name":"Pedro Pablo Celedón","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65010542ffc9de0edf610abc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1988154,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Milenko Skoknic","original_name":"Milenko Skoknic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650105795545ca00fea6ed6c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1988154,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Milenko Skoknic","original_name":"Milenko Skoknic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6501056ed7dcd200ffebd50e","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630514,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pedro Pablo Celedón","original_name":"Pedro Pablo Celedón","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65010584d7dcd200c536ddea","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630514,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pedro Pablo Celedón","original_name":"Pedro Pablo Celedón","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650105a5e0ca7f012eb8ee38","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630514,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pedro Pablo Celedón","original_name":"Pedro Pablo Celedón","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65010549d7dcd200c536ddaa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809796,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mauricio Yazigi","original_name":"Mauricio Yazigi","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6501059cffc9de0ee3c61608","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2445976","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
