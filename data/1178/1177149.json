Ah King (Louise Lee), who tries hard to break off from her jammed public housing life, gets married, only ending up in another abusive relationship. Given her circumstances, Ah King really doesn't have much choices. Both episodes feature superb scripts and stunning performances.","popularity":0.2996,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":49122,"logo_path":"/rMguvMJUI7ZGUaILxEZbTpfV1pO.png","name":"RTHK","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1978-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Eaves: The Story of Ah King","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1587473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Lee Si-Kei","original_name":"李司棋","popularity":0.5392,"profile_path":"/7Dki1pg8IeMGCqdnTW4MLViN1u5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ah King","credit_id":"6500a0bf5545ca011ba666c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Ng Man-Tat","original_name":"吳孟達","popularity":0.9151,"profile_path":"/nu5qhbsfrQeTUGNJAkf7yCJQqY2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6500a0d4ffc9de0ee3c5f4c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Cheng","original_name":"鄭裕玲","popularity":1.0816,"profile_path":"/fnbJTW1jf93T8pexvjWNjOxW3gq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6500a0dc1bf266011c783519","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chan Bo-Cheung","original_name":"Chan Bo-Cheung","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6500a0e75545ca00e1afd572","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ming Wai-yi","original_name":"Ming Wai-yi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65003a5e1bf266013a750262","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3655474,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joyce Chan","original_name":"Joyce Chan","popularity":0.262,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6500a5b73ff2df00c63209cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ming Wai-yi","original_name":"Ming Wai-yi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6500d2895545ca00c4dadeab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
