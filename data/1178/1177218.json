Filmed over the course of four very cold months in upstate New York, the footage documents the trails we walked daily during breaks from installing a kitchen and a new well in a 150-year-old country home so that my elderly parents could get out of Manhattan during Covid. These months were a true trial of our relationship and the outcome is my first true love poem, full of the fear, doubt, and hesitation that comes with the willingness to commit to someone, to become family.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Become","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Kraushaar","original_name":"Max Kraushaar","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650069f81bf266011c7826de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chelsea Werner-Jatzke","original_name":"Chelsea Werner-Jatzke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65006a056a222700aba8a5d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Local Sightings Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
