Joyce deploys a creative mix of dialogue and monologue to illustrate Lisa's complicated personality. She might act like any normal obedient daughter around her parents, yet other times she reveals her overly sensitive and suspicious mind as her moods run the gamut from poetic to violent. The villa where Lisa is sent to heal becomes a tumultuous battleground when a young doctor who has his own psychological hang-ups begins treating her and a conflict of egos is ignited.","popularity":0.3814,"poster_path":"/nkCwOsJjZCOPsI7PUMKQxiTu8tO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79261,"logo_path":"/4OKzkasr0IV8CSqejjgRfKw7e0m.png","name":"TVB","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1976-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seven Women: Liza Wang","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":240159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liza Wong Ming-Chuen","original_name":"汪明荃","popularity":0.5683,"profile_path":"/qOFfvIys9ollcRwhfk3Tj4ZZNOR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Liza","credit_id":"6500beb26a222700fd20607b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Yu Yang","original_name":"于洋","popularity":0.3392,"profile_path":"/oPe0MSd6tA1JbslywoKyenJkO20.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6500bf1f3ff2df0100d3c508","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3127262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lok Kung","original_name":"Lok Kung","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6500bf37efea7a00fd1b88f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1698121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yip Ping","original_name":"Yip Ping","popularity":0.0758,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6500bf4de0ca7f00cbea9fde","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Tam","original_name":"Patrick Tam Kar-Ming","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/7QdaxdLfd9jeuIHXXSDdAocqkyK.jpg","credit_id":"6500d1bfd7dcd2011c608075","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65962,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bill Wong Chung-Piu","original_name":"Bill Wong Chung-Piu","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/1Mbv42Rd8cfFWRkDPmIpTZukMos.jpg","credit_id":"6500d20ad7dcd2011c608085","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1766149,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Johnson Chow","original_name":"Johnson Chow","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6500d3d9e0ca7f00ec8d1721","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Tam","original_name":"Patrick Tam Kar-Ming","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/7QdaxdLfd9jeuIHXXSDdAocqkyK.jpg","credit_id":"6500d1d91bf266011c783fe5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3655474,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joyce Chan","original_name":"Joyce Chan","popularity":0.262,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6500d1e5ffc9de0eded44d24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":945583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wong Tin-Lam","original_name":"Wong Tin-Lam","popularity":0.4826,"profile_path":"/nNw8LwY3rcrIQKUPbSnBHBhiiUi.jpg","credit_id":"6502e41fefea7a00e0367773","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1242,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kZWMYSVQuhqboSqaqYePs1mn6TD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2208}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nkCwOsJjZCOPsI7PUMKQxiTu8tO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1863,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z93gmpK9zU137RAd8Ck0TEeaEXT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1242}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
