The woman once fell in love with the local count. However, without hesitation, the count left her heartbroken for a rich aristocratic girl who seduced him. Years later, the count refuses to pay alms to the gypsy camp, so a couple of desperate gypsies decide to kidnap his five-year-old daughter. The scorned woman recognises her old beloved count in the child’s face and decides to do the right thing.
