Eduardo was only three years old when César passed away. Growing up comfortably in the San Francisco Bay Area, where his father Fernando was a lawyer, Eduardo had difficulty connecting with his grandfather’s life.​  After a turning point in his life, Eduardo began to explore the places, learn about the people, and carry out the activities that were so important to César. Eduardo’s journey included working in the fields, picking grapes, as both his grandfather and father once did.​  Eduardo’s goal is to share César's message with a new generation. This film is Eduardo’s first step in honoring his legacy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4tufec7tWs9R8nrsbJ0bf6JL24w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hailing Cesar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4270303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Chavez","original_name":"Eduardo Chavez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65021a43efea7a0137d30ef9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4270305,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Corinne Marquardt","original_name":"Corinne Marquardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65021a37d7dcd2011c6120fb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4270303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Chavez","original_name":"Eduardo Chavez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65021a066a222700e0f2fb96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4270304,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sirous Thampi","original_name":"Sirous Thampi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65021a267a97ab011eda36e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4270303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Chavez","original_name":"Eduardo Chavez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65021a165545ca00e1b06979","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6019326","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4tufec7tWs9R8nrsbJ0bf6JL24w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
