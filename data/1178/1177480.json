Out of frustration, Shehu vows to never touch another American woman again. He travels home to Nigeria to find a wife and hang up his bachelor ways. His plan is to find a nurse so she can get certified in the USA and make enough money for him to stay home and drink beer if he so chooses. When Shehu returns to the USA with a new wife and a fresh outlook on life, he didn't count on his new wife learning the ways of the African American woman. Now his wife has embraced her new-found identity, and Shehu is stuck trying to figure it all out.","popularity":0.717,"poster_path":"/4fEvreLCI542I6dT13cLfdHk8q9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pascal Atuma Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My American Nurse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":929826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emayatzy Corinealdi","original_name":"Emayatzy Corinealdi","popularity":0.4185,"profile_path":"/yjc72CjOicfI4LxdoIQJ3VwpKF0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6500f192efea7a00fd1b93cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305376,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pascal Atuma","original_name":"Pascal Atuma","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Shehu","credit_id":"6500f1a15545ca0138d1847e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18299,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ime Etuk","original_name":"Ime Etuk","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nyong Akpan Etuk","credit_id":"6500f1b2db4ed61032a78fc1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305376,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pascal Atuma","original_name":"Pascal Atuma","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6500f18aefea7a00e0357c10","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305376,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pascal Atuma","original_name":"Pascal Atuma","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6500f1851bf266011c78460f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0498370","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":1392,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4fEvreLCI542I6dT13cLfdHk8q9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7587,"name":"nigeria"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
