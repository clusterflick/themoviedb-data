Their situation has gotten more and more challenging as Lucas gets older and stronger. With limited resources and support, caregiving takes a toll on their physical and mental health.  It’s a common story among parent caregivers: the isolation, uncertainty about the future, lack of options, and a never-ending daily to-do list means the role of caregiver overpowers nearly every other facet of life. Video diaries from diverse caregivers featured in the film illustrate this universality, while interviews with mental health and policy/legal experts provide a broader view on the societal impacts.  Through the power of unfiltered, compelling human stories, Unseen cultivates compassion and tangible support for the caregivers in our communities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5HCA96Cck0eyRlmKXsGLyOBbPdb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"UNSEEN: How We’re Failing Parent Caregivers & Why It Matters","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Ronne","original_name":"Ryan Ronne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"650083dee0ca7f014f707817","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267607,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jess Ronne","original_name":"Jess Ronne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"650083f31bf26600c5d5f466","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267602,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tom K.
