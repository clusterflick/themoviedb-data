As NYC emerges from the chaos of 2020, Marti Cummings (they/them), an audacious and big-hearted drag queen, goes all out in a historic bid to become a City Councilperson. It’s one of the most hotly contested Council races in years, and Marti’s strongest competitor is Shaun Abreu, a tenants’ lawyer with deep roots in the district’s Latinx community. As these first-timers race to do the most good for their Upper Manhattan neighbors, they offer very different visions for Democratic politics – one in a suit and tie, the other in combat boots and floral print. As this immersive documentary reveals, Marti’s passion inspires queer activists and allies to change the political system. Their campaign becomes a community of its own, especially for Marti’s non-binary peers who have never before seen themselves represented.","popularity":1.1865,"poster_path":"/hu2fUz9XyYzzkccLmtclDGDBwjf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":202588,"logo_path":"/ieCpIcxoLn8Knya1sxp8aUKf1VC.png","name":"Digital Harvest Media","origin_country":""},{"id":224176,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spoonbill Stories","origin_country":""},{"id":224177,"logo_path":null,"name":"Traverse32","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Welcome to a different kind of drag race.","title":"Queen of New York","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2419993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marti Gould Cummings","original_name":"Marti Gould Cummings","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/tQ0QteF7OMQWLdgo0ooy9ID6TPe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6502757f5545ca0138d25709","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Porter","original_name":"Billy Porter","popularity":0.7494,"profile_path":"/3BrMhoTURtBpbPZjNxYILmxfqJP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65027593ffc9de0ee3c6c773","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2073292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez","original_name":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez","popularity":0.3583,"profile_path":"/zRCSdgQZQ1r4HODKi8VDu3oS8O8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6502759a5545ca011ba762df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1325716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilana Glazer","original_name":"Ilana Glazer","popularity":0.487,"profile_path":"/etW0YsMvj67bSRuJCsevpAOLsWf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"650275a11bf26600ac75a6c5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4102611,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emma Fidel","original_name":"Emma Fidel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65027566efea7a0137d3421b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15346940","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/h5PuSYPimkJdGdU9g6XPVnW7mNU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hu2fUz9XyYzzkccLmtclDGDBwjf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dYyVC27lpguJc9NFPXxTtITtAvV.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":752,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gBj2RuE71bz1fzDZMdJxjcdv4BM.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":171636,"name":"drag"},{"id":220658,"name":"local politics"},{"id":250606,"name":"queer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"QUEEN OF NEW YORK Trailer","key":"873037225","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-10-10T18:21:47.000Z","id":"65fc8f4d0bc5290162af83ea"}]}}}
