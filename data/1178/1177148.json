Writer Joyce Chan realistically portrays a teenaged girl whose choices are finite if she wants to survive. We see Ah Sze in one scene, an innocent girl still in pigtails, in stark contrast with the next scene after she has lost her virginity. It creates an emotional impact that is more than heart-wrecking.","popularity":0.3698,"poster_path":"/6LDNRg6e4H4CRMO6pPLJYvvuuN7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79261,"logo_path":"/4OKzkasr0IV8CSqejjgRfKw7e0m.png","name":"TVB","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1976-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Social Worker: Ah Sze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"北斗星：阿絲","type":"Original Script Name"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1112421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilia Wong","original_name":"黃杏秀","popularity":0.2686,"profile_path":"/omD7IGtMiSfysVeIn9KK8rFO4h1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ah Sze","credit_id":"65003892ffc9de0ee3c5d332","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ng Wai-Kwok","original_name":"Ng Wai-Kwok","popularity":0.2627,"profile_path":"/sfMdf1uVX8TfQPx1nAJFFvWI2F3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"650038a6db4ed61032a75c13","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Ng Man-Tat","original_name":"吳孟達","popularity":0.9151,"profile_path":"/nu5qhbsfrQeTUGNJAkf7yCJQqY2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"650038b96a222700c3b5fabf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damian Lau Chung-Yan","original_name":"劉松仁","popularity":0.9642,"profile_path":"/k0uz2mgjDvRtrevcTBlZ5K0RKeV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"650038c7e0ca7f012eb8af76","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":123199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Hui","original_name":"Ann Hui","popularity":0.3997,"profile_path":"/3HPHP8G9QZOtYgDwo9zqCqJmZUl.jpg","credit_id":"65003840d7dcd200e2fcddbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3655474,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joyce Chan","original_name":"Joyce Chan","popularity":0.262,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6500a1955545ca00ab5d3d8b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65962,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bill Wong Chung-Piu","original_name":"Bill Wong Chung-Piu","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/1Mbv42Rd8cfFWRkDPmIpTZukMos.jpg","credit_id":"6500d2b11bf26600ffb5cea7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":890,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rNGwVjsUQ182LWU7qa0G8s5CKNf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1582},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":795,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cjSeyAwvVzAm3X41oiabvDz5FI6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6LDNRg6e4H4CRMO6pPLJYvvuuN7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
