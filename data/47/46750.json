The film consists of German and Soviet archive footage of the World War II — to be exact, from the end of the war. An attempt to make a large–scale documentary on this subject had been undertaken in the Soviet cinema of the 1960s: the film — “Ordinary Fascism” — by the outstanding Soviet film–maker Mikhail Romm had become a classic retrospective investigation of fascism. But Sokurov uses the expressive power of the documentary image in an absolutely different way. He does not amass materials for a large–scale picture of Nazi crimes.","popularity":0.337,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sonata for Hitler","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Sonata para Hitler","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Hitler","original_name":"Adolf Hitler","popularity":0.7926,"profile_path":"/n6f81IUSes1a8jTzUIF7rJ5zZnP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe470ac3a36847f812072b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67826,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johann Sebastian Bach","original_name":"Johann Sebastian Bach","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/l8QFP8Pt4IQc4iQPvYbgIyNTEXX.jpg","credit_id":"52fe470ac3a36847f8120721","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55975,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Krzysztof Penderecki","original_name":"Krzysztof Penderecki","popularity":0.1157,"profile_path":"/7cAbfLFn5pYQFLAdHzcb64dPqQa.jpg","credit_id":"52fe470ac3a36847f8120727","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksandr Sokurov","original_name":"Александр Сокуров","popularity":0.2767,"profile_path":"/oNLxLidA1BOuZ7OyQcQXWKcl4E0.jpg","credit_id":"53f89dc00e0a267a750022ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksandr Sokurov","original_name":"Александр Сокуров","popularity":0.2767,"profile_path":"/oNLxLidA1BOuZ7OyQcQXWKcl4E0.jpg","credit_id":"53f89dc90e0a267a72002306","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81766,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aleksandr Burov","original_name":"Александр Буров","popularity":0.0706,"profile_path":"/zUpIrX9VoCiGSxALRaSn2sGROv.jpg","credit_id":"61c093486a300b001d9b8ced","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0175190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
