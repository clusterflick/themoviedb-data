In the old Russian city of Novgorod, the merchants are feasting in a gorgeous palace and Sadko is bragging that he can bring to their land a sweet-voiced bird of happiness. They laugh at him, but he is offered help by the Ocean King's daughter, who is mesmerized by Sadko's singing and is in love with him. The hero is destined to visit many lands in his search of the bird.  First shown in the USA in 1953 with English subtitles. This entry is for 1962 English-dub by Roger Corman's Filmgroup, which runs about 8 minutes shorter (removes much of the music) than the Russian original (see, Sadko, 1953)","popularity":0.9407,"poster_path":"/9UpOTqdYNERkfGDX5UzCCfOxb4Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1953-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic Voyage of Sinbad","video":false,"vote_average":5.536,"vote_count":28,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Sadko","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Sadkos Abenteuer","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Sadko, der Vagabund","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Sage von Sadko","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Садко","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Balladi Ihme-Sadkosta","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Sadko - Lockendes Glück","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Stolyarov","original_name":"Sergei Stolyarov","popularity":0.2238,"profile_path":"/6bozjY7ul7kmfT7904jsd2Mf3f7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sadko [Sinbad in dubbed version]","credit_id":"52fe471ac3a36847f8123859","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alla Larionova","original_name":"Алла Ларионова","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/yVMco3rFtRFXeiu6tdtH8GtXwZs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lyubava","credit_id":"52fe471ac3a36847f812385d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":305418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ninel Myshkova","original_name":"Нинель Мышкова","popularity":0.2267,"profile_path":"/9xf0e36IxiAbUl7Q3z2j4E5Ywl6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Princess of Lake Ilmen","credit_id":"52fe471ac3a36847f8123861","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"B.
