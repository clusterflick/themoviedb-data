However the government suddenly goes cold on the plan and it is not made public why. There is talk of homeless people who use the tunnel as shelter going missing, even though the government states that there are no homeless people in there. This, and the silence from the officials and ministers, leads a journalist, Natasha to begin an investigation into a government cover-up. She and her crew Pete (Producer), Steve (Cameraman) and Tangles (Sound Technichian) decide to investigate the story in the tunnel.","popularity":2.4543,"poster_path":"/d9cWMXgqRYZhBqnf7UI4eaFTJsF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23800,"logo_path":null,"name":"Distracted Media","origin_country":""},{"id":23802,"logo_path":"/nd5Cx3OoqeocjKQh8rg3CPGPLtG.png","name":"Zapruder's Other Films","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":23805,"logo_path":null,"name":"DLSHS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2011-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The light runs out","title":"The Tunnel","video":false,"vote_average":5.737,"vote_count":388,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"The Tunnel - OZ","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Тоннель","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"The Tunnel - Fürchte die Dunkelheit","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"The Tunnel Fuerchte die Dunkelheit","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":135482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bel Deliá","original_name":"Bel Deliá","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Natasha Warner","credit_id":"52fe46ebc3a36847f8119ba1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Arnold","original_name":"Luke Arnold","popularity":0.4326,"profile_path":"/b19aJzhUAfyQXd0mtmDvLAyOth8.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Jim 'Tangles' Williams","credit_id":"52fe46ebc3a36847f8119ba9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Rodoreda","original_name":"Andy Rodoreda","popularity":0.1125,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Peter Ferguson","credit_id":"52fe46ebc3a36847f8119bad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Caitlin","original_name":"James Caitlin","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/oxGzs0MRbVMjvyzmmU6P1yvgN6F.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Trevor Jones","credit_id":"52fe46ebc3a36847f8119bb1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Goran D.
