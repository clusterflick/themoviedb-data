Throughout the decade he toured hundreds of North American colleges delivering \"comedy lectures\" which consisted of tales from his life, adventures with an ad hoc group of adrenaline junkies called the Dangerous Sports Club, equally dangerous friends like the Who's Keith Moon and, of course, his fellow Pythons. In the spring of 1988 he launched his final college tour before his death in 1989, the best of which is presented here, videotaped under Graham's supervision and taken from his personal archives.","popularity":0.0543,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looks Like a Brown Trouser Job","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Chapman","original_name":"Graham Chapman","popularity":0.6327,"profile_path":"/qmTXDGNxuuwQ4IGNHwxmCdjuTGk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe46f8c3a36847f811c917","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0464818","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
