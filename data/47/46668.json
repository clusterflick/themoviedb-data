X-Dance Film Festival 'Best Director' winner Johnny DeCesare and water-cinematographer Jace Panebianco, spent three years in production and filmed in seven countries in search of windsurfing's new frontier. The Windsurfing Movie II expands on the story lines of The Windsurfing Movie with legendary Red Bull riders Jason Polakow, Robby Naish and featuring 16-year-old phenom Kai Lenny. Through interactions with windsurfing's rich cast of characters, Levi Siver learns that sometimes you have to go further afield to find the best wind and waves--and to eventually find the best in yourself.","popularity":0.3702,"poster_path":"/bvRsDyTI3l5vt4SFSwp4QkKg8rE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11120,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poor Boyz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"More than just wind and waves","title":"The Windsurfing Movie II","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":137131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Levi Siver","original_name":"Levi Siver","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4705c3a36847f811f545","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Lenny","original_name":"Kai Lenny","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":"/5dJo7oMn1RjyxmNX4vlwlTRA3XT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4705c3a36847f811f549","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":565594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Polakow","original_name":"Jason Polakow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63a4689cd4fe0400c1667208","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1511155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robby Naish","original_name":"Robby Naish","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/AqzmFRfneqB2VLna0KhRmyynWjZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63a468bbe24b93008c8ef44f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":137131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Levi Siver","original_name":"Levi Siver","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a46b7268b1ea007b774819","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jace Panebianco","original_name":"Jace Panebianco","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a46c3a28d7fe007cd0b40d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2180381,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Johnny DeCesare","original_name":"Johnny DeCesare","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a4695843501100ef5e8292","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jace Panebianco","original_name":"Jace Panebianco","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a4697628d7fe00bf989d6f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2047889","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/8KNPIwTOhM8bunabNwcrNhZtH7q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1780},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rgE9GZdtSPWgEowpBC2WQmMplHs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":872,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/bvRsDyTI3l5vt4SFSwp4QkKg8rE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":585}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":193144,"name":"windsurfing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
