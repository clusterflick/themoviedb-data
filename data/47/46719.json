The mixed media featured include puppetry, CGI, hand-drawn animation, illustration, acrylics, claymation, and even 'animated' tattoos, just to name a few. This mass-collaboration approach is less about remaking Romero's film and more about viewing the classic through an experimental lens. Instead of trying to alter Image Ten's work, NOTLD:R seeks to showcase the responses that artists from around the world have had to this landmark film.","popularity":0.1128,"poster_path":"/aLgBPvZLntT6GecHYUm5OmixM4O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's Night Like You've Never Seen Before.","title":"Night of the Living Dead: Reanimated","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":15767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Schneider","original_name":"Mike Schneider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4708c3a36847f8120049","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1520368","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cRxqq6ZflYi4PDubyUBTh8bRf53.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aLgBPvZLntT6GecHYUm5OmixM4O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":703}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
