It's fun and easy as you read the on-screen lyrics and join the festivities. Invite your friends -- after all, it's even more fun when you share! Children as young as two will have a ball when Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy -- and other favorite Disney friends -- throw a party inside Disneyland's Haunted Mansion! There's plenty to do: pumpkin carving, bobbing for apples, cooking with Goofy -- even trick-or-treating in Toontown! But most of all, there'll be lots of singing and dancing to silly spooky songs of the season. So c'mon everybody, time to party!","popularity":1.6935,"poster_path":"/jcyZOArwLvIkv4N45xp6LitDvV2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126540,"logo_path":"/eNwCQbBPAfDL8U4JUvBgyaKtth2.png","name":"Walt Disney Home
