Focusing on the tactics, technologies and intelligence available to both sides, Holland examines the ways in which both Germany and Britain used their resources: from aircraft to air defence, and from intelligence to organisation. And, by gaining rare firsthand testimony from German veterans, and access to the untapped diaries and documents we reveal that this was a battle of two sides and many layers. Part of the Battle of Britain season to mark the 70th anniversary.","popularity":0.2515,"poster_path":"/tLyH6oEYwyKdYAICcekcLCvrWz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78524,"logo_path":"/mjGIRLCzcTLyQEYBic1Ofxc33My.png","name":"Maya Vision International","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Battle of Britain: The Real Story","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1974156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Holland","original_name":"James Holland","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/wSKwmFGhcqwDdM0ZjMF7RcmPnv5.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"5a7af17fc3a3687b54007e7b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2347103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James McNicholas","original_name":"James McNicholas","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/kGSPSl4K8etVAKMmDtsSRn5hpiu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"German Soldier (voice)","credit_id":"64b32b7e23d27800c93bd9cf","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1974156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Holland","original_name":"James Holland","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/wSKwmFGhcqwDdM0ZjMF7RcmPnv5.jpg","credit_id":"661919e2bbcae00162951324","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1974157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Young","original_name":"Aaron Young","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66191a30b9a0bd017c1185ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1974157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Young","original_name":"Aaron Young","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7af1bcc3a3687b63006bff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1854244","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tLyH6oEYwyKdYAICcekcLCvrWz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fO79PkkRq6JyKkmMWt8NIbZ5nYC.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1076,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dz3EnCCaQm7gnwuIFC2TRVCasFJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
