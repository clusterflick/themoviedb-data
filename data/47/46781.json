Puce Moment resulted from the unfinished short film Puce Women. The film opens with a camera watching 1920s style flapper gowns being taken off a dress rack. The dresses are removed and danced off the rack to music. (The original soundtrack was Verdi opera music; in the 1960s, Anger re-released the film with a new psychedelic folk-rock soundtrack performed by Jonathan Halper.) A long-lashed woman, Yvonne Marquis, dresses in the purple puce gown and walks to her vanity to apply perfume. She lies on a chaise lounge which then begins to move around the room and eventually out to a patio. Borzois appear and she prepares to take them for a walk.","popularity":0.3191,"poster_path":"/5sMKFvwnogVNRZdHd0JITAE3bqE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Puce Moment","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":63,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Проверка на женственность","type":"Russian Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":543197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Marquis","original_name":"Yvonne Marquis","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hollywood Star (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe470cc3a36847f8120acd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Anger","original_name":"Kenneth Anger","popularity":0.1883,"profile_path":"/gspoSoEjQSpBKBQx3g9frjFOM7f.jpg","credit_id":"52fe470cc3a36847f8120ac9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Anger","original_name":"Kenneth Anger","popularity":0.1883,"profile_path":"/gspoSoEjQSpBKBQx3g9frjFOM7f.jpg","credit_id":"52fe470cc3a36847f8120ac3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Curtis Harrington","original_name":"Curtis Harrington","popularity":0.2431,"profile_path":"/3my60VLWbu47jMRyVGTfg6QcoK1.jpg","credit_id":"64762ad81bf266043ecdfa2e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Anger","original_name":"Kenneth Anger","popularity":0.1883,"profile_path":"/gspoSoEjQSpBKBQx3g9frjFOM7f.jpg","credit_id":"5d4e7ba57c6de30013a697f2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Anger","original_name":"Kenneth Anger","popularity":0.1883,"profile_path":"/gspoSoEjQSpBKBQx3g9frjFOM7f.jpg","credit_id":"5d4e7b74a1074b0014285373","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0041771","wikidata_id":"Q7258211","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7Vi6T6LtpUX3hvow8NhMnHTg0mM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1G0pJ01J3yJUVdpzXd6jVZJe1Lp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":816,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sezvmUZjpMX7JIcP2mD7VmcJoVs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1452},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p3kaY3bxOr9Sk3Lb95SH0QoWB9N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bYrHkAYSRty3SrGYuorUWY00WPM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nUQLsBX4jN5if2jOxQEMIU8lAAh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5sMKFvwnogVNRZdHd0JITAE3bqE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":683},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jCvpkqFhGeBHQG3B191wRPD3tQy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9oW1svQg8vs8sGZbUxUa9ZKglvl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qR0AuByzviCLAxindt0zF4UlYrK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/98RLYxbwS2cajkgCPmdIaFVQE7z.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinemateca Portuguesa","release_date":"2009-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
