The name itself is synonymous with legendary performances. Countless iconic musicians and comedians have been on that stage. To be a part of that history was something I’ll never forget. As much as I was trying to keep my head together before the show, I couldn’t help but feel like a tourist or just some random dude who won a contest. LET IT GO represents the culmination of material I developed on the road from 2008-2009. As always thanks to everyone who came out to my shows, laughed at the funny stuff and stared during the bombing. I hope you enjoy it. – Bill Burr","popularity":0.5985,"poster_path":"/9DKunkJiOxInOXZsk22bULt1428.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8774,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art & Industry","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill Burr: Let It Go","video":false,"vote_average":7.689,"vote_count":106,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Burr","original_name":"Bill Burr","popularity":1.7401,"profile_path":"/fP2UJs7RiSafEHxDFYVjVFSesda.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4718c3a36847f8123259","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Burr","original_name":"Bill Burr","popularity":1.7401,"profile_path":"/fP2UJs7RiSafEHxDFYVjVFSesda.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4718c3a36847f8123255","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1641158,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jon D'Uva","original_name":"Jon D'Uva","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd7fe959e8a900c5a06a41","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4219521,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"AJ Tragethon","original_name":"AJ Tragethon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd8025d100b614b5f72c90","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1641158,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jon D'Uva","original_name":"Jon D'Uva","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd7ff437109700ac43dd91","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1775781,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Harari","original_name":"David Harari","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd7f935ab81a00ad1fca3b","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578902,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jarid S.
