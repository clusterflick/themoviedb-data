All in white, the naïf Pierrot lies in a wood. Doo-wop music plays as he rises, stares about, and reaches for the moon. Although music abounds and the children of the wood are there at play, Pierrot is melancholy and alone. Harlequin appears, brimming with confidence and energy. He conjures the lovely Colombina. Pierrot is dazzled. But can the course of true love run smooth?","popularity":0.3845,"poster_path":"/2rlL9nrfCqcV35R5pzKvkmVXcdm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50382,"logo_path":null,"name":"Puck Film
