After a sudden change, their distant daughter Sarah visits them, but finds Will as difficult to talk to as ever. However, over the course of their visit, they rediscover the bonds that bind them together despite all that pushes them apart. Produced with a unique collaborative approach over two years of filming, “Something Solid” draws on the rhythm and beauty of a small-town community to tell a universal story of family, madness and love.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Something Solid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","title":"El viejo molino","type":"Spanish"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4926030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Dodson","original_name":"Philip Dodson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66da38b51fd8b8e8b7c5c474","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4926031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuella Bonifaci","original_name":"Manuella Bonifaci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66da38bfb43133ab2b5dbf84","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1573867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noémie Schmidt","original_name":"Noémie Schmidt","popularity":0.5154,"profile_path":"/6fsNemSp3kOTVXXEKegsG4sCi0l.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66da38cea678e3806ddde5b8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3162486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Maple Carpenter","original_name":"Paul Maple Carpenter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66da391b12cbf3af8c8c934d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3162486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Maple Carpenter","original_name":"Paul Maple Carpenter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66da392374abebf6f98c9338","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3138399,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Noé Dodson","original_name":"Noé Dodson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66da3932d49ec36b1a34b5cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2721452,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elie Aufseesser","original_name":"Elie Aufseesser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66da3943cf832c84ffbfe34e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1987820,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tanja Todorova","original_name":"Tanja Todorova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66da39529fcfd96b88219a70","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
