As they enter the cold, swampy island forest, two coast guards watch them, making the uncle uneasy, while Facu dismisses his father’s fate. They confront each other, deepening the pain of absence, driving Facu to enter his father’s house. The coast guards approach the uncle, and Facu escapes into the forest but one guard follows him, drawing his weapon. Facu’s only option is to jump into the river, realizing underwater that to save his uncle he must reconnect with his father.","popularity":0.1046,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":238258,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Pantano Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2024-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waterline","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2166549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomás Wicz","original_name":"Tomás Wicz","popularity":0.0727,"profile_path":"/nGeaoe7LMzeybNyqNg4BzAi7czD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66da43b973cc9999852741b5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2740272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diego Gallardo","original_name":"Diego Gallardo","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/dTPQgdgZQRxU9R4gPupYLBIhHP2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66da43c3f79edf5df015eb18","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2684904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Miró","original_name":"Fernando Miró","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66da43cfbd1f265deb219a65","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2356623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aldo Onofri","original_name":"Aldo Onofri","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/l5YOO4x9XE5VVW7iRQ1hg2YRvuX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66da43d7154cc1feabd5940d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4926104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucila de Oto","original_name":"Lucila de Oto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66da43e824193b7d52219a7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4926105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gastón Bonalve","original_name":"Gastón Bonalve","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66da44003a95cee76d3c4750","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
