A work about meeting each other, dancing together, being a couple, intimacy and dialogue, loosely inspired by the film Ginger and Fred starring Marcello Mastroianni and Giulietta Masina as an elderly tap-dancing couple, Pippo and Amelia. The title comes from the reversal of a line Amelia says at the end of the film to Pippo: “I don't think we will have the chance to dance together again.” It is also a work dedicated to the performers, the masks they wear, and their determination to play all their lives.","popularity":0.112,"poster_path":"/fm1l9yykf6xSOjNk8qnQtVW0tbO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avremo ancora l’occasione di ballare insieme","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3676250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Alberici","original_name":"Francesco Alberici","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66d97a6d322156d41a9d4cfe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4924748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martina Badilucci","original_name":"Martina Badilucci","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66d97a737a7985a620606bca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2485942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daria Deflorian","original_name":"Daria Deflorian","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66d97a7de74671ccc809846c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3697220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica Demuru","original_name":"Monica Demuru","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66d97a946da0b214d62a03ba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1782090,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Antonio Tagliolini","original_name":"Antonio Tagliolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66d97a9bb05536ab69b8d7c2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emanuele Valenti","original_name":"Emanuele Valenti","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/yZJg4gQS6bqCR5E1dJ9vOZQ8BC2.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66d97aa4d51a81c668270c82","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2485942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daria Deflorian","original_name":"Daria Deflorian","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d97a4f9086cc277f270f5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3697219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Tagliarini","original_name":"Antonio Tagliarini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d97a5986fec3ad28606a7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":124763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Cuttica","original_name":"Francesca Cuttica","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/aasOdnou0UtH5OtchEbvDr5h8AK.jpg","credit_id":"66d97acf7666822ac19da205","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1873092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica Piseddu","original_name":"Monica Piseddu","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":"/mqdklvoKFYW9QlkiyhDqERLbQtQ.jpg","credit_id":"66d97ada7946a2f50fbda2f3","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1676738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benno Steinegger","original_name":"Benno Steinegger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d97ae53e0f534ee90193d4","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6vnqUMN5SULTL1cD3Gul9K73b6J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fm1l9yykf6xSOjNk8qnQtVW0tbO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
