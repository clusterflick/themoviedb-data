Or is it a reflection of violence within the relationships between parents and children? “Escarabajos” is about how the same power relations, submission, extortion, psychological, economic and sexual manipulation are played out within the four walls of a seemingly normal bourgeois family, drawing a parallel with the outside world. Marta, Oscar and Rubén fight to survive, using their most suitable resources for a ruthless survival, aware that someone will get hurt. And so, to survive, to become again and again. That is what is called, today, being alive.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Escarabajos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
