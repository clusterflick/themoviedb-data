The Wolves winger and Spanish international is infamous for his strength and speed, which make him one of the most unique players in world football. Also a practicing Muslim, Wolves TV were given access to follow Adama over the period of Ramadan, as he embraces his religious values by giving back to the community through various means. In Adama Traore: The Holy Month, the Spaniard helps out at the Good Shepherd food bank, dishing out meals to support people in Wolverhampton in food poverty, while also meeting children and teenagers with disabilities, and inspiring young refugees to follow their dreams. He speaks about his family's influence, Ramadan memories as a boy growing up in Barcelona before speaking at a multi-faith Iftar event hosted by Wolves at Molineux Stadium about why good deeds and conversations about faith are so important to him.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/2Je0SpLXqPHBusNpdQWgqTkEFRg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238077,"logo_path":"/1NMgBRP5DCLj0YTzd5ybl4NOdlx.png","name":"Wolves Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adama Traore: The Holy Month","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Adama Traore: El mes sagrado","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adama Traoré","original_name":"Adama Traoré","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/xHbHE8qd6vNYdua1tVBMVh4u4Ef.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66d936c69086cc277f270dce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Townsend","original_name":"Roy Townsend","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/ebOA2ky4kay5jzU2r18ifyDWWGQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66d93ad415ce126cc6fcbedb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3354325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yannie Makarounas","original_name":"Yannie Makarounas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d93ba531172c4469bd9e4f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aOOQVCnnYKDUHzOiQLWAqzObjCP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1921},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4UZoIumPPhICSZmNaLtqaC6ckfd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1921}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Je0SpLXqPHBusNpdQWgqTkEFRg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/52DMtFnVSMEvHjWmR6qnsOUOSEN.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Adama Traore spends Ramadan giving back!","key":"TEfvPM5WIFo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2023-06-03T18:00:11.000Z","id":"66d93721a6340e39739d9e22"}]}}}
