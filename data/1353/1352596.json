The first version of the film, entitled \"Mabul,\" was banned by the Soviet government. The 5-part version of the film has survived: a version modified by the will of censorship with other names of the characters, an updated storyline, a more positive attitude and a happy ending. The finale of the final reel shows the mass scenes of the revolutionary struggle in St. Petersburg, the scene of the Jewish pogrom.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/a4cqNx7jBp0bwJ2FU70iTHcRY4G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":410,"logo_path":"/eZlhJ4iCRM90hLB4RCC6RJEC9zr.png","name":"Sovkino","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1927-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Protiv voli ottsov","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Against Father's Will","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Mabul","type":"Re-edited version of"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4924984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.
