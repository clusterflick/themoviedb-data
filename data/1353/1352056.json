He had invested clients' money in a major industrial venture but was reported by his friend Hinkel, who was in love with Borkman's former fianc√©e, Ella Rentheim. Borkman now lives on the first floor of the house, with his estranged wife, Gunhild, living on the ground floor. He occasionally receives visits from his friend Wilhelm Foldal, who supports Borkman's delusion that the bank will reinstate him. In his youth, Borkman betrayed his love for Ella by marrying her twin sister Gunhild to advance his career. After his conviction, Ella took care of their son Erhart and now wants him to live with her and take her name. Borkman agrees, but Gunhild refuses to let her sister take their son.","popularity":0.2126,"poster_path":"/yrbgEoQnUFzxjsBBomoiJhovvrk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Gabriel Borkman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omero Antonutti","original_name":"Omero Antonutti","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":"/2MWM2DCyuQM1fLoplTCeN2KsJY7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66d85b37005d624a116ce669","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianni Bonagura","original_name":"Gianni Bonagura","popularity":0.1975,"profile_path":"/7IPaeFBBM9EHxmB7WjemUixCNDX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66d85b3d3ed64d469f29e359","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":235253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marisa Fabbri","original_name":"Marisa Fabbri","popularity":0.1893,"profile_path":"/uVhJENS9XNZtrGgfct9PdRwsjNk.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66d85b433a94a49c1626eccf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Giannotti","original_name":"Claudia Giannotti","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/iaM8DltGaXop11lCOJBiVJItTUa.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66d85b482e4b6922eebf5159","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefano Madia","original_name":"Stefano Madia","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":"/5trcnwfigFUMa54WL2ZWWsSIB1E.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"66d85b4eb228ac48180ee6b1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4923062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanna Maronetto","original_name":"Susanna Maronetto","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"66d85b5844d359f12c4f4e5c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2593403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franca Nuti","original_name":"Franca Nuti","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":"/skIQIuKioneKbmR8u00uxV6SPSv.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"66d85b5ccc1479a16029e16c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1095350,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gabriele Zamparini","original_name":"Gabriele Zamparini","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"66d85b6228871ee4404f4b2e","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1353859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Ronconi","original_name":"Luca Ronconi","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":"/2uqE33KRjpjiwjnNAuT2K0uQ2eK.jpg","credit_id":"66d85ab076b129b261b8b526","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1008333,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henrik Ibsen","original_name":"Henrik Ibsen","popularity":0.1783,"profile_path":"/7dh8HZGcyATPbl563SJ0x1SVoef.jpg","credit_id":"66d85ac29ca487a0859d8302","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1794483,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Eugenio Guglielminetti","original_name":"Eugenio Guglielminetti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d85ad00850835db49d847b","department":"Crew","job":"Scenic Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":937425,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Vera Marzot","original_name":"Vera Marzot","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d85ae25ea72dbb5cbf5167","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3522423,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Ludovico Negri Della Torre","original_name":"Ludovico Negri Della Torre","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d85aee53e19ba112474439","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32914861","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yrbgEoQnUFzxjsBBomoiJhovvrk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285695,"name":"theater"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
