Meet Buddy, encased in a white cotton exterior with two blue stripes adorning his upper calf region. Buddy has lived the entirety of his brief existence within the hellscape that is a teenage boy's bedroom. Each day he sits, usually amidst a collage of underwear and sticky substances, waiting for his opportunity to live, to experience life beyond the prison of a four-walled structure. Most days he's left limp and disappointed. That is until Charlie, his owner, meets Judy, wearing a sock of her own with contrasting red stripes and a heel flap to die for. Suddenly Buddy's entire world is thrown upside down as he makes the sudden leap from experiencing nothing to everything. Through every up and down Charlie faces, so does Buddy, finally understanding what it means to actually live. As the world around him spins faster and faster, can Buddy maintain control of his own life, or is truly living not all it's cracked out to be?","popularity":0.0543,"poster_path":"/mH155U5nBn4LdBmwv1wdYg0FHeO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":216509,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Butterfly
