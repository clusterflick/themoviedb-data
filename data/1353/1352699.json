From her own story emerges the broader narrative of colonization, colorism, assimilation, integration and the social benefits of “race” and their impact even today. Brutalized by police officers in Montreal in December 2017 in front of witnesses, the filmmaker takes a step back to understand this gesture, which speaks to the social interpretation of skin color.","popularity":0.4521,"poster_path":"/AisxqHYZ3bJqiimCNLovUzf3MwY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":204401,"logo_path":"/uH2o8nZrDEiduKWX96zQ0t9NwA4.png","name":"Yzanakio","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ma Traversée","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4297675,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Diana Goudrouffe","original_name":"Diana Goudrouffe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Elle-même","credit_id":"66d9e212b1efb0dcea9da381","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469912,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Idriss Kanago","original_name":"Eric Idriss Kanago","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d9e042ced4c0bf13098c5c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2570762,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniela Mujica","original_name":"Daniela Mujica","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d9e0556da0b214d62a07ce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4619247,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"René Portillo Ruíz","original_name":"René Portillo Ruíz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d9e0707946a2f50fbda71a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2879386,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gentille M.
