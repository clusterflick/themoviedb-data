A boy who accidentally becomes incontinent during swimming lessons is labeled a “little zombie” and subjected to collective humiliation. Instead of doing him justice, his teachers attributed it to his “unlikability”. Years later, he entered the entertainment industry as an actor, and his teacher died of blood cancer. In a dream, he meets his teacher, who wants to reconcile with him, but he is obsessed with how to become as “likeable” as his teacher asked him to be. With this in mind, he approaches some entertainment stars. It turns out that all of them live with their own scars, and not all of their hatred can be found in themselves. One of the stars teaches the man a spell that allows him to travel through time and space, to fight against the past, to be brave when courage is needed.","popularity":0.1422,"poster_path":"/ff3tQqGSSFrmEgIrZj3xSTmCxjE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2024-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Knocking on the Door of a Fortress","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2916765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Xueqin","original_name":"李雪琴","popularity":0.6482,"profile_path":"/qWGpVGKheiqhbuTUTFY3nUOnh6V.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66d87e893fa5c5d97e3c0d8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3163139,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roy Wang","original_name":"Wang Yitong","popularity":0.216,"profile_path":"/ptehnWmMOgguxCSDbxcdauRF9rx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66d87e909f916816a06ceb40","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3863054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiang Qiming","original_name":"蒋奇明","popularity":0.7196,"profile_path":"/6OWIhJwjwiMWKBHcUTn7pglXEFx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66d87e961e030516ca29e8c2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3163137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kong Dashan","original_name":"孔大山","popularity":0.2142,"profile_path":"/vH5HNuEZ7ESkwdTCkS0daQ9VMDD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66d87e9b3ed64d469f29e49f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3074803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shipei Wen","original_name":"Shipei Wen","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/Aa9RqCkcs4M2eIMOzsLYZJJv6sD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66d87ea3b4fe5306014f4e07","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4923277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Sixian","original_name":"Li Sixian","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/dyBjdgWHFL0nxgLv0qDfzGhrG2k.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66d87ecc09b4083711096a6e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3163139,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roy Wang","original_name":"Wang Yitong","popularity":0.216,"profile_path":"/ptehnWmMOgguxCSDbxcdauRF9rx.jpg","credit_id":"66d87f22652143c2b74f50dd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3163139,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roy Wang","original_name":"Wang Yitong","popularity":0.216,"profile_path":"/ptehnWmMOgguxCSDbxcdauRF9rx.jpg","credit_id":"66d87f29ac5ccaa8339d8433","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3163139,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roy Wang","original_name":"Wang Yitong","popularity":0.216,"profile_path":"/ptehnWmMOgguxCSDbxcdauRF9rx.jpg","credit_id":"66f192d47300a5ba213ba847","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3163139,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roy Wang","original_name":"Wang Yitong","popularity":0.216,"profile_path":"/ptehnWmMOgguxCSDbxcdauRF9rx.jpg","credit_id":"66f192dade2d52dfbd8d38ec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33322069","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":969,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h5Blj8x3fvxRSqhnf2sOrUlj6lr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1723}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":4.448,"height":562,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/rdenjA12pwYp8df3oo2iJQ1wXkX.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500},{"aspect_ratio":4.448,"height":562,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/eylP0BN4nxxMUItewDGJMfHMKy4.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2800,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/ff3tQqGSSFrmEgIrZj3xSTmCxjE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pingyao International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
