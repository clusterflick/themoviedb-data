District Attorney Kamala D. Harris has convened City leaders to answer this problem and, along with key partners, has launched Back on Track, an innovative education and employment reentry initiative focusing on young adult drug offenders.  Designed to increase community safety by reducing recidivism, Back on Track couples strict accountability and close supervision with education, employment support and health care.  The purpose of Back on Track is to prevent young people from committing crimes by leading them to make life changing choices.","popularity":0.2744,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":230181,"logo_path":"/9bjMEufvWqfNp1ZpO9c9Vc9sdxf.png","name":"Citizen Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back On Track - Out Of The System","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":387,"name":"california"},{"id":220929,"name":"criminal justice"},{"id":229800,"name":"incarceration"},{"id":241782,"name":"criminal justice system"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":288298,"name":"san francisco"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"},{"id":340067,"name":"back on track"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
