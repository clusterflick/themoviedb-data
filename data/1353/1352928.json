This documentary presents Javier Paniagua and his family inhabiting a network of tasks, problems and choices of special scope. The commitment to produce healthy food for their community, told by the producers themselves. Located in El Pato, Berazategui, Javier’s farm is part of the largest horticultural belt in Argentina. Despite the difficulties in accessing land and technology, this territory is also the setting in which thousands of families choose a life in coexistence with nature.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ujuSAqvmrhh77SIIg6hWnHJWivv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2024-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live  on the ground","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199238,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Javier Paniagua","original_name":"Javier Paniagua","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66da69484190551d42d5a9a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4926314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magdalena Manguello","original_name":"Magdalena Manguello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66da6951785a8f6b37dd8e12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Sandoval","original_name":"Oscar Sandoval","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66da695c154cc1feabd5aa41","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840660,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joaquín Lucesoli","original_name":"Joaquín Lucesoli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66da697081ea85c0e421b464","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4926316,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Georgina Lucesoli","original_name":"Georgina Lucesoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66da6982154cc1feabd5aa53","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4926317,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cora Gornitzky","original_name":"Cora Gornitzky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66da69929ed6b682175dd753","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4926318,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edurne Battista","original_name":"Edurne Battista","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66da69a35492d740d5c5deef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4926319,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sergio Justianovich","original_name":"Sergio Justianovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66da69b450214e6c548a0406","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ujuSAqvmrhh77SIIg6hWnHJWivv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival de Cine de la Provincia de Buenos Aires","release_date":"2024-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
