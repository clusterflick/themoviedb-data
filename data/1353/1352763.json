Ten years earlier, as a result of his personal tragedy, Ángel had escaped to Mexico where he had become a TV soap star. Miguel Lama’s last wish for Ángel is to travel to a remote monastery up in the mountains of Northern Spain and there to read each page of Dostoyevsky’s thousand-page-novel The Brothers Karamazov three times, then to come to his graveside in the monastery cemetery every night to tell him about the progress made in reading the novel. This mysterious experience reveals the secret of Ángel’s tragedy and helps him understand the role of reading in healing inner personal traumas. Ángel also learns that no dictator in the East, West, South or North who destroys his own people and neighbors will be able to eliminate the importance of authentic literature as the cornerstone of humanity.","popularity":0.1214,"poster_path":"/eCXR6GJP1jnAlteyZU8r7e1akVq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94649,"logo_path":"/tuFCuMT4dLXZKmfTT0y8JKpTS6s.png","name":"Bad Taste","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":238696,"logo_path":"/r1eeQcIj46ibRvy6F956o1SWzeM.png","name":"Asociación Cultural Sad Hill","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Wish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Francés","original_name":"Eric Francés","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/bhOpCYPgkiW1JxNS7NwOwOaySdm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Angel Flores","credit_id":"66d9f5fc3fa5c5d97e3c3062","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":402598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Armani","original_name":"Nora Armani","popularity":0.1735,"profile_path":"/blf8a04C6XxsPC7GSvnEBRZHirB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Agrafena Grusenka","credit_id":"66d9f608a6bde0d9ad270f2d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4925566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentín Martin Cabello","original_name":"Valentín Martin Cabello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Miguel Lama","credit_id":"66d9f615b5cc774a57f57b95","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4925567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio García Hernández","original_name":"Sergio García Hernández","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Father Osma","credit_id":"66d9f62a86fec3ad28606e9e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1884040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nacho Angulo","original_name":"Nacho Angulo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Father Mateo","credit_id":"66e0a8046c3c221fb7f4e9be","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rax Rinnekangas","original_name":"Rax Rinnekangas","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d9f5cab20d24cca1fcc580","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rax Rinnekangas","original_name":"Rax Rinnekangas","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0a7e4748e3fb374129cbe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32080328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qtdRIMsPOTiKM3QZUkF4o6FGVOv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eCXR6GJP1jnAlteyZU8r7e1akVq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Helsinki International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
