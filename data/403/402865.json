Scraps of old curtains were glued onto clear 35mm film stock, providing both image and optical soundtrack.  That's it!  The delay between the image and sound reflects the physical gap (usually compensated for) between a projector's lens and its optical sound head.  Gardine Sing Sing is clearly musically structured, the sound that a piece of fabric makes what decided where it appears in the film.  Otherwise, it's very similar in execution to Brakhage's Mothlight.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gardine Sing Sing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johannes Przygodda","original_name":"Johannes Przygodda","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57677b0192514170b600014b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1993-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
