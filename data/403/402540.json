Filming in Burkina Faso, Mrozowski responded with this comedy about a dictator kidnapped from the present-day and taken back through the mists of time. There he meets the mother of humanity, Lucy, who teaches him the basics of sexual equality. By the time he returns to the present, he's also received an education in 16th-century slave-trading and European influences on Africa.","popularity":0.3822,"poster_path":"/56b7YtvqgKJt5WKIQS4eDodrtRE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75511,"logo_path":null,"name":"Direction de la Cinematographie Nationale","origin_country":"BF"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"}],"release_date":"1998-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucy's Revenge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Lucy's Revenge","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Novembre","original_name":"Tom Novembre","popularity":0.1587,"profile_path":"/YHLQQ5Z4PSsj1PoXWb7Jr6xmiO.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Georges, the bad white spirit","credit_id":"5763e626c3a36878eb000d80","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre-Loup Rajot","original_name":"Pierre-Loup Rajot","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/bdPzeiMZGKfTCpDc2KtAvsyTxwa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Father Edouard","credit_id":"5763e64d9251412986000193","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1161730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann-Gisel Glass","original_name":"Ann-Gisel Glass","popularity":0.1812,"profile_path":"/5Lm1yZTRQ482PIPWtZguVeFfRdc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sister Stella","credit_id":"5763e66792514133c5000057","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aïssa Maïga","original_name":"Aïssa Maïga","popularity":0.2644,"profile_path":"/9FF3z5T9W9FsSNJ367YlwpfGiqM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"5763e6819251412986000198","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1637355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrienne Koutouan","original_name":"Adrienne Koutouan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Albertine","credit_id":"5763e6aac3a3680a7e000037","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Désiré Koumsongo","original_name":"Désiré Koumsongo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Adama","credit_id":"5763e6db92514129860001a1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1320799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bala Moussa","original_name":"Bala Moussa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Cissé","credit_id":"5763e79fc3a36878eb000da1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhaïl Sleptsov","original_name":"Mikhaïl Sleptsov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"The polish waiter","credit_id":"5763e7b5c3a36809e600008a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janusz Mrozowski","original_name":"Janusz Mrozowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5763e73792514124770010ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637362,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Evelyne Georges","original_name":"Evelyne Georges","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5763ea479251412477001142","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637363,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Madeleine Vincensini","original_name":"Madeleine Vincensini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5763ea5dc3a3680a6c0000ed","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637364,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kat Onoma","original_name":"Kat Onoma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5763eaebc3a3680a7e0000c4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932232,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rodolphe Burger","original_name":"Rodolphe Burger","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":"/wmZRnRVTfVt9Qmaef1KV6uOMWqg.jpg","credit_id":"5763eb2592514134140000d5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0176094","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/56b7YtvqgKJt5WKIQS4eDodrtRE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":712}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":161757,"name":"fable"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1998-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
