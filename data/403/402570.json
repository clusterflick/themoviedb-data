His death hurt many people who had been touched by his vitality. One of these was Stefano who, fourteen years later, goes on a journey looking for the emotional traces left by Alberto’s life and work. He visits Rome – Mostar, where together they had run theater workshops for children and youths traumatized by war – and Canada, where Alberto spent the last years of his life studying and teaching. And where he had also left a written request that his ashes should remain.","popularity":0.0812,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15902,"logo_path":null,"name":"CSC","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"release_date":"2015-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Brother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Moj Brate: My Brother","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nazareno Manuel Nicoletti","original_name":"Nazareno Manuel Nicoletti","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/60vdGg8zGsJ3M0t2HpMzC0OZDBW.jpg","credit_id":"5764508d92514142f5000061","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nazareno Manuel Nicoletti","original_name":"Nazareno Manuel Nicoletti","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/60vdGg8zGsJ3M0t2HpMzC0OZDBW.jpg","credit_id":"57645092925141426900005f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4871164","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5301,"name":"brother"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
