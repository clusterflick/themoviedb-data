These scenes are intermingled with footage of Larraz discussing his work while Novis shoots the aging director taking long walks through old cemeteries and twisted hotel hallways. These walks seem to trigger a flood of memories for Larraz and the ghosts of his past begin to materialize. The director quietly expresses his disappointment with the business side of filmmaking that he encountered at film festivals like Cannes where “exhibitionism and opportunism” were rampant. But most of the conversations revolve around his thoughts about aging, his appreciation of family, regret over lost loves and the lack of critical respect for his work. He also discusses his lifelong fascination with the supernatural and the desire to find a new approach to the horror genre","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2011-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Vampyres and Other Symptoms","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635445,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Celia Novis","original_name":"Celia Novis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575f33de92514123770004ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635445,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Celia Novis","original_name":"Celia Novis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575f33e79251412388000465","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1978499","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
