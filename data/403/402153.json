Information is conveyed through subtitles and instead of voice-over, the soundtrack consists of period sound, usually from radio broadcasts, and brooding, disturbing jazz score by Tibor Szemzõ. What wee see is a Jewish family first living unknowingly in the shadow of the Holocaust and then trying to cope with it still unaware of what it will finally mean. A shot of the film's photographer Max Peereboom, and his family we've come to know, cheerfully sewing and doing general preparation for a trip to a \"work camp\" when their destination was in reality the nightmare of Auschwitz adds a devastating dimension to our understanding of the Final Solution that nothing else, no Hollywood movie, no documentary, has been able to provide.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/2ddJ0NGrLINdaZFaZ7XxV357clQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Family Chronicle","title":"The Maelstrom: A Family Chronicle","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Péter Forgács","original_name":"Péter Forgács","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/9YtYczhzLJ303s536DQfQIxtI8y.jpg","credit_id":"57603ed492514166070016a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635911,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kati Juhász","original_name":"Kati Juhász","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57603eef9251416654001843","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635912,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zsolt Hubay","original_name":"Zsolt Hubay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57603f079251415e27002ebe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1478855,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tibor Szemzö","original_name":"Tibor Szemzö","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675898757680b1177f3abefb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0245248","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2ddJ0NGrLINdaZFaZ7XxV357clQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Archivio Aperto","release_date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
