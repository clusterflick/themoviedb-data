They conclude that our need for self-realization through consumption leaves us with a sense of meaninglessness. An experiment is initiated and they gather a group of young people in an isolated house in the countryside. During the stay in the house, Simon gradually becomes a sovereign leader. What started out as a field study gradually turns into something more similar to a cult.","popularity":0.0856,"poster_path":"/b65U6fFMsE6Gr686L8wOJaIqzVQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80467,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ögat
