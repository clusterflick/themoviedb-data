By observing its quasar. As objects get pulled onto the accretion disk orbiting a supermassive black hole, friction creates a bright light known as a quasar. In this video, researchers use a “galaxy-sized lens” to analyze light from a distant quasar—revealing a supermassive black hole with a truly voracious appetite.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":54152,"logo_path":null,"name":"The American Museum of Natural History","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Distant Quasars: Shedding Light on Black Holes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
