Ince may well have been the director of The Despoiler as indicated by the credits; but since Ince was known far and wide as a glory-hogger, it's also possible that one of his talented lieutenants wielded the megaphone. A Civil War drama, The Despoiler refuses to take sides, demonstrating that there are heroes and villains in both camps. Capturing a small town, Colonel Charles K. French orders his men to reclaim the funds raised for the enemy by the townsfolk. French's drunken, lacivious second-in-command Frank Keenan intends to extort money from the citizens by threatening the virtue of the town's female population.","popularity":0.267,"poster_path":"/dSn6qN7a7V3KJgwu3zeoOSaKLRM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36181,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kay-Bee Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":50574,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York Motion Picture","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Despoiler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Keenan","original_name":"Frank Keenan","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/sdBLDsWLGThNyUTI56PtGm2uGQp.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"The Emir","credit_id":"599dd6c19251411ef30241c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enid Markey","original_name":"Enid Markey","popularity":0.2145,"profile_path":"/ihoIvZF4nk59zhleufqy0clpSGa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sylvia Damien","credit_id":"599dd6cdc3a36827f0024b57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles K.
