In Jan. 2014 Mötley Crüe held a press conference announcing their final tour ever, complete with a “cessation of touring” agreement prohibiting all future live engagements. The Final Tour ended up being comprised of 164 concerts over two years, all ending with a hometown gig at Los Angeles' Staples Center. This New Year’s Eve Celebration was filled with hits like Kickstart My Heart, Girls Girls Girls, Home Sweet Home and many more. Now, for only one night, this last ever performance event gives fans front row access. Catch the moments that were buzzed about, such as Tommy’s infamous “Crüecifly” drum roller coaster, and behind the scene moments that will now just be coming to light.","popularity":1.0302,"poster_path":"/qsHjlOt5goZp7PZMFneQReH6UwW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mötley Crüe: The End - Live in Los Angeles","video":false,"vote_average":8.6,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":155681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vince Neil","original_name":"Vince Neil","popularity":0.3068,"profile_path":"/md3L9JDo59vzSMS5IvA88lMPkic.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5760d37092514175c1000044","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1452828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikki Sixx","original_name":"Nikki Sixx","popularity":0.1092,"profile_path":"/nW1RddeDDsm2WMr11WCPPGxVpgG.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c57c5f192514135b050df1b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Mars","original_name":"Mick Mars","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/2QpwNnXZP7iVImjSGyjxzriyHDt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5760d37bc3a36808c600004d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Lee","original_name":"Tommy Lee","popularity":0.3173,"profile_path":"/5CYLPoGgR4TbuQCQmXRskYGSnya.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5760d31f92514175b6000028","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Tremaine","original_name":"Jeff Tremaine","popularity":0.2346,"profile_path":"/3R8FemTgvyY1vLn9r0lYlL45P3Q.jpg","credit_id":"5760d29f9251417106000074","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1149064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Lamb","original_name":"Christian Lamb","popularity":0.0826,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5760d2b4c3a36808c6000001","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6241654","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sDX0E5QmAtRalwjVJZpBsSzX9DF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qsHjlOt5goZp7PZMFneQReH6UwW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/r24ujBiMbmypVFKpmHJdF3ExABM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1141,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ld5pdDiD18oMyh74WgrECqfv2WI.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":856}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":5540,"name":"heavy metal"},{"id":12670,"name":"los angeles, california"},{"id":156205,"name":"concert film"},{"id":340184,"name":"mötley crüe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer","key":"laTbHazBZYM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2024-02-07T15:00:47.000Z","id":"66fb7214d8064165bdf16957"}]}}}
