Taggart, the saloon owner, is the secret head of the outlaws, while Connor's brother Bill is in cahoots with him. Steve Randall, the Durango Kid, and his pal, Smiley Butterbean, arrive in time to stop a stagecoach holdup, and Steve is made a deputy sheriff. Taggart has one of his men, Slade, pose as the Durango Kid and while he is speaking to the townspeople, the rest of the outlaw gang pillages the town, and this somewhat damages the Durango Kid in the eyes of Larry and his sister Doris. Steve suggests that Sheriff Connor visit the government about a railroad project, and Taggart instructs Slade and the gang leader to kill Connor on his trip back.","popularity":0.2734,"poster_path":"/mqbGpChXluJWoRTAz7F0oyCLm92.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Durango Kid and Smiley bring you double-barreled wild west thrill-fun!","title":"Roaring Rangers","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Starrett","original_name":"Charles Starrett","popularity":0.2938,"profile_path":"/7DhidPyO8Z3regVeobzhRcbqlZT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Steve Randall / The Durango Kid","credit_id":"5763f486c3a3680a7e0001f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":631540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adele Roberts","original_name":"Adele Roberts","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":"/m50qjQBu86Vw4BQVtAEpI6bD9c9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Doris Connor (as Adelle Roberts)","credit_id":"5763f496c3a3680a7e0001f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":121082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merle Travis","original_name":"Merle Travis","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Guitar Player Travis","credit_id":"5763f4a492514124770012b1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Smiley Burnette","original_name":"Smiley Burnette","popularity":0.2736,"profile_path":"/hfwpyujboZDjvsEqOEBxT5vJ9U5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Smiley Burnette","credit_id":"5763f4b29251413414000205","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Cobb","original_name":"Edmund Cobb","popularity":0.2406,"profile_path":"/icnYHc5GwjZzl9wF2nLP8rPvL8a.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Taggart (uncredited)","credit_id":"5763f4c792514124770012b8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rube Dalroy","original_name":"Rube Dalroy","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Barfly","credit_id":"5fefdf2f5907de00403a8f48","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Nazarro","original_name":"Ray Nazarro","popularity":0.1698,"profile_path":"/pQ1pF6pAEuKCAOFvrnk05PBN9Pw.jpg","credit_id":"5763f46ec3a36809f90001cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":161984,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barry Shipman","original_name":"Barry Shipman","popularity":0.0808,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5763f478c3a36860a500064c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0038887","wikidata_id":"Q15688824","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h6rcDPKwm23vyZwedwQAilelqOe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mqbGpChXluJWoRTAz7F0oyCLm92.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1946-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
