This very alternate and visual interpretation of the fate of Miyamoto is brought into a mixture of contemporary Yakuza underworld and a hypnotic Samurai after-life. We flow seamlessly between through life, death, rebirth and the afterlife and challenge our traditional definition of the past, present and future. The film explores the agonizing and painful processes that go through the shattered mind of Miyamoto, as he desperately tries to hold on to the only thing he has left - The rapidly fading memories of his undying love for a woman named, Otsu. A love that for a Yakuza-Samurai is strictly forbidden and which will prove to have catastrophic consequences.","popularity":0.3781,"poster_path":"/jA1C9XClHZQ9kNAX67pLQE6bnNO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spearhead Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2014-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark Samurai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Sakurai","original_name":"David Sakurai","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/j02QQPwQiujYoXehOMafcNjh3Rq.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Miyamoto","credit_id":"5765be81c3a368109d000657","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1638024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Cho","original_name":"Louise Cho","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":"/sSnrz24PzqvCr8zcQWjrezMW0cW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Otsu","credit_id":"5765be92c3a3687fd10008f5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638026,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sidney Lexy Plaut","original_name":"Sidney Lexy Plaut","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5765bea29251417a9a0007ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638026,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sidney Lexy Plaut","original_name":"Sidney Lexy Plaut","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5765beae9251417a9f000809","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638026,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sidney Lexy Plaut","original_name":"Sidney Lexy Plaut","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5765beb6c3a3687fd1000900","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":119105,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lene Børglum","original_name":"Lene Børglum","popularity":1.166,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5765bec792514107e00006bd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638029,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adriana Filipczuk","original_name":"Adriana Filipczuk","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5765bed592514104ad000708","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638026,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sidney Lexy Plaut","original_name":"Sidney Lexy Plaut","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5765bee3c3a3687fc800081b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638026,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sidney Lexy Plaut","original_name":"Sidney Lexy Plaut","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5765beeec3a3687fd100090c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":135959,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johannes Elling Dam","original_name":"Johannes Elling Dam","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5765bf03c3a3680c890007d4","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":135961,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Pavlovic","original_name":"Alex Pavlovic","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5765bf129251417a97000814","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135965,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eddie Simonsen","original_name":"Eddie Simonsen","popularity":0.2501,"profile_path":"/2yKVwnua0tQ8Ajiu3pUS7Gs4SdT.jpg","credit_id":"5765bf219251417aa20008b9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638031,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Joon Poore","original_name":"Joon Poore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5765bf30c3a3687fe40007a9","department":"Crew","job":"Stunts"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3013260","wikidata_id":"Q20494022","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2828,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jA1C9XClHZQ9kNAX67pLQE6bnNO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1462,"name":"samurai"},{"id":1794,"name":"yakuza"},{"id":155198,"name":"ronin"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CPH PIX","release_date":"2015-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Camerimage International Film Festival","release_date":"2014-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
