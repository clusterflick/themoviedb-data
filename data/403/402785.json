A team of uniformed players, led by the artist Ashley Bickerton, performs the mechanics of a game servicing an off-camera betting entity, the ‘House’. Although the game keeps changing and players are swapped out, one thing remains the same, the ‘House’ is hidden and controls the bets, the ‘chance’ of winning is nil.  The game, in fact, is not between the players, but rather between the ‘House’, and the ‘Bettor’.” — E.B. 1983","popularity":0.092,"poster_path":"/cyGKlQT6gShDzwinDE4F3MoOuKb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You the Better","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Bickerton","original_name":"Ashley Bickerton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"576692c89251413768001102","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"5766928692514137680010f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"57db2eb4c3a368079600038b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"57db2ecc9251416934000079","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679688,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brooke Halpin","original_name":"Brooke Halpin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57db2edcc3a3681874000113","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1280314,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Suzanne Pillsbury","original_name":"Suzanne Pillsbury","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57db2ef1c3a3681a1c00007e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"57db2efa925141681c0000ce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679689,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tom Crawford","original_name":"Tom Crawford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57db2f14925141681c0000d6","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352239,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dan Walworth","original_name":"Dan Walworth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57db2f21c3a368078b00042b","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11454742","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1094,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cyGKlQT6gShDzwinDE4F3MoOuKb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":771}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
