On the one hand is Babarimisa, a young man from Benin who suffers from a relentless disease for which seems to have no remedy. Desperate to save his mother, Morenike, a Yoruba priestess goes to invoke the power of the Orishas gods. Meanwhile in Argentina, Shantas is a young offender living in a marginal area tainted by the practices of Umbanda, a cult derived from African religions. None of us can even imagine the surprises that come in the destination.","popularity":0.0602,"poster_path":"/glWm50SySTrc7vs7AEbmIAAx0CS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orillas","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1109308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonel Arancibia","original_name":"Leonel Arancibia","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Shantas","credit_id":"5764ec6492514168ab000903","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1409171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dalma Maradona","original_name":"Dalma Maradona","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/lscE8lWrpsjiNlOsJ6u2FiAlozX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elisa","credit_id":"5764ec6ec3a3680ccb000b2b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":945604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Lombardo","original_name":"Javier Lombardo","popularity":0.2088,"profile_path":"/6S3X5UA26It9HrJUM5LUaD7LEjw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Alberto Núñez","credit_id":"5764ec7992514167de0009b0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Valenzuela","original_name":"Daniel Valenzuela","popularity":0.2723,"profile_path":"/qKPZcY1ACEreQtKzjqkn7YjUMlM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Julio","credit_id":"5764ec839251415f9300097c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carole Lokossou","original_name":"Carole Lokossou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Morenike","credit_id":"5764ec8d92514168f200090c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilias Akala","original_name":"Ilias Akala","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Babárisimá","credit_id":"5764ec98925141681e00090d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo César","original_name":"Pablo César","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/AjZamwNeBkZWymTcffzpYECaj6T.jpg","credit_id":"5764ec4792514168ab0008fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1841781","wikidata_id":"Q76511703","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nRIU9QV8aLgBuMclCK6yDDN9JpU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/glWm50SySTrc7vs7AEbmIAAx0CS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
