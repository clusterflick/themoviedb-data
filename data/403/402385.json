The trouble is, he cannot marry her until he earns her father's respect and approval. As he lives up in the Canadian wilderness, the enthusiastic suitor immediately boards a northbound train. It is a long-trek, but eventually he knocks upon her father's cabin door and finds her \"twin\" sister there to greet him. Athletic and daring, she shows the city slicker up at every turn. At one point she even tries to seduce the young fellow, but though she is attractive, he is not swayed (it's a good thing too as the \"twin\" is really his true-love in disguise). One day real trouble comes in the form of two burly, bullying loggers who beat the sawdust out of the hero. To get revenge, he calls his best friend, the ex-world heavyweight champion, to come for a visit. With his help, the hero teaches the loggers a lesson, wins his lady's heart and finally the approval of her father.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pennington's Choice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0005884","wikidata_id":"Q20649386","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
