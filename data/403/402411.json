In their own words - originally recorded in shorthand - they discuss photography, colour theory, Moliere, the scientific method, the crazy ideas of balloonists, and - of course - how to live for 100 years. These two legends of the 19th century have a lively and interesting conversation. One was born before the French revolution; the other was destined to see the marvels of the aeroplane and the movies.","popularity":0.3336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The First Interview","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Bell","original_name":"Nicholas Bell","popularity":0.3545,"profile_path":"/u6wGCSowG03IkZiXEFO8ecYXiZv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Chevreul","credit_id":"5762d3d3c3a3680863000023","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Robertson","original_name":"Tim Robertson","popularity":0.1301,"profile_path":"/89p75RNh3111YldOjpaerWpTvJC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nadar","credit_id":"5762d3e6c3a3680863000028","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnès Varda","original_name":"Agnès Varda","popularity":0.6122,"profile_path":"/8XKM6DCVcH5RsgIRh9mwVaEM0YB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self / Host (voice)","credit_id":"5762d3f39251410315000604","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dennis Tupicoff","original_name":"Dennis Tupicoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5762d3a9925141030f00060f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dennis Tupicoff","original_name":"Dennis Tupicoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5762d39d92514103150005fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2241675","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
