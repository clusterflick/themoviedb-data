His only daughter, Monika Besse, who lives in Luxembourg, arrives to arrange the funeral and settle his estate. She wishes to get back to Luxembourg and to her normal life as quickly as possible.\r However, she quickly realizes that in fact, she hardly knew her father, and tries to trace the various stages and encounters that made up his life.\r Much later, she realizes that the search for the identity of her father has actually become a search of her own identity – though still she believes she can get closer to her father after his death.","popularity":0.466,"poster_path":"/c4iNYYNKp2P475r8GKIEi579G9e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224,"logo_path":"/fCv129CE3olInpdEiOWcC5s2YbQ.png","name":"Wega
