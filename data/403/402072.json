For the first time in 100 years, someone has attempted a murder. With the advent of the Robot, crime has virtually disappeared. Yet a murder attempt has been made, and it may happen again.

You'll have to move quickly though, and catch the criminal before another attempt is made.","popularity":1.6165,"poster_path":"/bQz62rgTsIdESC4hYGdZACq3fZO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"VCR Mystery Game","title":"Isaac Asimov's Robots","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1954679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Pettiford","original_name":"Valerie Pettiford","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Newscaster","credit_id":"5a500c51c3a3685a3c00006b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Rowe","original_name":"Stephen Rowe","popularity":0.4209,"profile_path":"/140AKjFOAoYchbMGy9pOkLfaAfE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Elijah Baley","credit_id":"5a500c6ac3a3685a3c00007d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1954682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Levine","original_name":"Richard Levine","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"R.
