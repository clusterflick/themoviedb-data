They are occasions for men to adorn their bodies with paint and feathers, to display their strength in dance and ritualized aggression; for trading partnerships to be established or affirmed; and for the creation or testing of alliances. In the feast filmed in 1968, the Patanowa-teri had invited the Mahekodo-teri to their village. The two groups had been allies until a few years before this event, when they had fought over the abduction of a woman. They now hoped to renew their broken alliance, which they did successfully. Soon after the filmed feast, the two villages together raided a common enemy. A detailed discussion of this feast, and of the significance of feasting among the Yanomamo, is found in chapter 4 of Chagnon's Yanomamo: The Fierce People. The film's graphic representation of reciprocity and exchange may enrich (and be enriched by) a reading of Marcel Mauss' The Gift.","popularity":0.048,"poster_path":"/1DdZOkfn62UrmRVUBWewSAoFFOk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Feast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Napoleon Chagnon","original_name":"Napoleon Chagnon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57639768c3a3684be10005d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Asch","original_name":"Timothy Asch","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/oV9VoDYCu3nN3682PeeJobg6KzQ.jpg","credit_id":"57639750c3a3687811000160","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12803558","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1DdZOkfn62UrmRVUBWewSAoFFOk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1970-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
