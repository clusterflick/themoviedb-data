Klahrâ€™s breakthrough series traces an alternate history of 20th-century America in a collection of 12 diverse shorts. From the nuclear paranoia of The Organ Minder's Gronkey to Hi-Fi Cadets, where JFK is employed as a janitor in a neighborhood high school, Klahr's lo-fi animation style astutely captures the anxieties, dreams, disappointments, and promises of our recent cultural history.
