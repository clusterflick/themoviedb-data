At low tide, many square miles of mud flats surface between the mainland and the northern islands. The Netherlands grow and shrink with the movement of the moon. Sudden incoming tide make these flats 'sea' again, sometimes drowning hikers by surprise. The Wad does not know what to make of itself. Land, see, mud, ocean floor... Two characters (and their dog) are stranded there in that desolate place. The only dramatic elements in this comical short are the sea, the wind, the sand and a lonely sea gull. Drawn in mud and tar on wet sandpaper.","popularity":0.4008,"poster_path":"/yAOYcC4w9T7fo5rbeDd0Wv6rDUo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18889,"logo_path":"/30mRFDmJAdbOMCFhFGst9izWJhD.png","name":"Il Luster","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2003-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wad","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1402745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joris Oprins","original_name":"Joris Oprins","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576340de92514148ed0002ae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1402745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joris Oprins","original_name":"Joris Oprins","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576340d492514148970002fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0469990","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yAOYcC4w9T7fo5rbeDd0Wv6rDUo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1199,"name":"netherlands"},{"id":177094,"name":"mud"},{"id":219898,"name":"mudflats"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
