Snopes sets his employer's barn on fire when he thinks he's been treated unfairly. His son, Sarty, is horrified. Snopes escapes justice for lack of proof, but he and his family are told to move on. No sooner do they move than Snopes is offended by his new rich employer. Torn between trying to win his father's acceptance and his aversion to what his father will do, Sarty must make a decision and act quickly. Adapted by Academy Award winning screenwriter Horton Foote, Faulkner's complex world of class divisions and hostile family relationships comes to life through a boy's attempt to liberate himself from hatred and poverty.","popularity":0.9479,"poster_path":"/z02mBo4LqNCgzXBBMBPjLoAnNDW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Learning in Focus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barn Burning","video":false,"vote_average":4.667,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Lee Jones","original_name":"Tommy Lee Jones","popularity":2.6538,"profile_path":"/zixpaPmOonRh1I3TWgxDkeGxkrv.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Ab Snopes","credit_id":"5aac983692514116c000991e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1254683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane Kagan","original_name":"Diane Kagan","popularity":0.2048,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"627c98bce2ff320066e0feda","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3545939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shawn Whittington","original_name":"Shawn Whittington","popularity":0.0674,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sarty Snopes","credit_id":"627c98d2967cc70051d70c95","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":175066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolyn Coates","original_name":"Carolyn Coates","popularity":0.0647,"profile_path":"/ODBhizybK1q9kIzbI3kgYR9AuG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Aunt","credit_id":"627c98e82fccee005024f7bb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3545940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Riney","original_name":"Michael Riney","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Brother","credit_id":"627c98f7fd4a9600a4c527e8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":78963,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jennie Hughes","original_name":"Jennie Hughes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Lena Snopes","credit_id":"627c990d3af929004f346553","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1287812,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Julie Kaye Fanton","original_name":"Julie Kaye Fanton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Donna Mae Snopes","credit_id":"65499195d55c3d00e21352d7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1066346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Scott","original_name":"Al Scott","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Judge","credit_id":"654991b043494f011ec7a224","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Royals","original_name":"Tom Royals","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Harris","credit_id":"654991dbd55c3d013920458a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Faulkner","original_name":"Jimmy Faulkner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Major DeSpain","credit_id":"654991ea43494f011ec7a264","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Pettigrew","original_name":"Jean Pettigrew","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Mrs. DeSpain","credit_id":"654991fa924ce60101f5a138","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1046100,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Hal Phillips","original_name":"Thomas Hal Phillips","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Justice","credit_id":"6549920b924ce6013bb79595","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4121816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Franks","original_name":"James Franks","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Blacksmith","credit_id":"65499232fd4f80013cea2b55","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simpson Hemphill","original_name":"Simpson Hemphill","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Stranger","credit_id":"6549923d391b9c00c613e474","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Fonda","original_name":"Henry Fonda","popularity":1.2023,"profile_path":"/6wXWsqSXF3wCsGcwVqiszy6RX9X.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Self -
