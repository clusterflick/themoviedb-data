There, the lawyer meets Opal Dunn, a deeply religious woman who has a premonition about his family's destruction, but who believes that all things will pass if you have faith. This is a compelling story of a man's love for his family, as he goes from arrogance to humility and into a journey of faith. -  Mary Daniels, Jan Felt, Angella Joy","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/zG758btAtgAZ89LcQWwjaEeAvVh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"More Than You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1198615","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zG758btAtgAZ89LcQWwjaEeAvVh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
