Round Trip is a story from Israel that depicts a blossoming relationship amidst the stark outskirts of Tel Aviv, between Nurit a mother of two separated from her husband who drives a bus for a living, and Mushedi, her live-in nanny from Ghana .  Soon, Nurit’s husband infers that the two women are engaged in an un-orthodox relationship, and challenges their committed and abiding love.  This thoughtfully created narrative serves as a gentle reminder that throughout the world, people continue to struggle for love, but that the journey of self-discovery makes the trip worthwhile.","popularity":0.1135,"poster_path":"/rZb0F5N8OWur7mXE86ocn06pkk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2003-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Round Trip","video":false,"vote_average":3.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Al HaKav","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"על הקו","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Round Trip","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anat Waxman","original_name":"Anat Waxman","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nurit","credit_id":"53834d81c3a36805a400858b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1019889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eyal Rozales","original_name":"Eyal Rozales","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Yossi","credit_id":"53834dfd0e0a2624bd00c96e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1019889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eyal Rozales","original_name":"Eyal Rozales","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mushidi","credit_id":"53834e360e0a26588c008151","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nthati Moshesh","original_name":"Nthati Moshesh","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Avsholom","credit_id":"53834e5f0e0a2624c000cd3a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reut Kahlon","original_name":"Reut Kahlon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Hila","credit_id":"53834eabc3a3680598008b7e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ido Port","original_name":"Ido Port","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Zohra","credit_id":"5727bebfc3a3681da2000a9d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324526,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Noa Greenberg","original_name":"Noa Greenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53834d1e0e0a26588c008133","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shahar Rozen","original_name":"Shahar Rozen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53834cef0e0a2657cd00551c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomer Shani","original_name":"Tomer Shani","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f96aa48a1074b0037f56bd6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2830772,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dan Itzhaky","original_name":"Dan Itzhaky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f96aa59a1074b0035f5d0d1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0433043","wikidata_id":"Q4464942","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x4VTPzoGmO19dQ6cgBUFHzLOpMa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cmdh8wPRmfsqz0nfm18Kxkl9JOw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/idEtHXk5iDZMONL3XFKRCLQ12UA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vkzAY0MqTBBue8iNHuBsubS9hIx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rZb0F5N8OWur7mXE86ocn06pkk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1334}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9833,"name":"lesbian relationship"},{"id":15160,"name":"divorce"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
