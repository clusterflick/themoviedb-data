While on a camping trip, Thomas' only daughter, Lara, is killed by a logging truck in a hit-and-run accident for which the driver, Luke, serves a prison sentence. Stricken with grief, Thomas sheds his urban life and his identity, and moves to the remote town where Lara was killed. There he takes on a new name, Chris, and finds work as a logger.","popularity":0.7801,"poster_path":"/qRi16xRfGQ7DU7nRtZKhJM4WxaC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fell","video":false,"vote_average":9.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Nable","original_name":"Matt Nable","popularity":0.6514,"profile_path":"/pgBnQepmJGApWaAwwlr6VMdmLY9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Thomas","credit_id":"5387cc0ec3a3681ad7003b08","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Henshall","original_name":"Daniel Henshall","popularity":0.5627,"profile_path":"/spfdesJvIoPTmZWMe5ncyMbnOV5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Luke","credit_id":"5387cc1dc3a3681aea00366b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4695757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brendan Green","original_name":"Brendan Green","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Local in pub","credit_id":"6637cdab813cb60124891494","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kasimir Burgess","original_name":"Kasimir Burgess","popularity":0.0625,"profile_path":"/6RzIX0bEkBkrI4HSJfbqL1vhaLa.jpg","credit_id":"5387cbc3c3a3681af00038f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325776,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Natasha Pincus","original_name":"Natasha Pincus","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5387cbdfc3a3681add003998","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293870,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marden Dean","original_name":"Marden Dean","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5387cbeec3a3681ada0038ae","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4189485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Kaufman","original_name":"Charles Kaufman","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c7791830f79c00ae8e2990","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3039280","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1754,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qRi16xRfGQ7DU7nRtZKhJM4WxaC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1240},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eu7127zyegeDV9ylhFCJNtSCieu.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fell - Official Trailer","key":"88Oo0u5S44Q","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2015-06-22T07:10:32.000Z","id":"65de6edf9638640185d7253e"}]}}}
