It was certified Gold by the RIAA on 18 January 1991.  The title refers to Morrissey's childhood home in Hulme, Manchester. The L is silent, so it sounds like \"humourist\". The promotional films are 'The Last of the Famous International Playboys', 'Sister I'm a Poet', 'Everyday is Like Sunday', 'Interesting Drug', 'Suedehead', 'Ouija Board, Ouija Board' and 'November Spawned a Monster'.","popularity":0.704,"poster_path":"/zARQbO5H3Ql1P9413AsQwQaqQen.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morrissey - Hulmerist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":414041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morrissey","original_name":"Morrissey","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":"/h4NgzVBnzwWg6LbnmsxXZ6UUcbV.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"53831b600e0a2624c000c73a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Rush","original_name":"Jason Rush","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Cast - The Last of The Famous International Playboys","credit_id":"5cb76b4f0e0a266b98ef819b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie Whitelaw","original_name":"Billie Whitelaw","popularity":0.3652,"profile_path":"/zd72JkqXOcDdgyJ2pybVKZwHnLy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cast - Everyday is Like Sunday","credit_id":"5cb76b8992514108d8f62db2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1234481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheryl Murray","original_name":"Cheryl Murray","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Cast - Everyday is Like Sunday","credit_id":"5cb76b970e0a266b93ef8f41","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucette Henderson","original_name":"Lucette Henderson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Cast - Everyday is Like Sunday","credit_id":"5cb76ba60e0a266b96ef75d9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane Alton","original_name":"Diane Alton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Cast - Interesting Drug","credit_id":"5cb76d21c3a3686af9841bb1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Sims","original_name":"Joan Sims","popularity":0.3487,"profile_path":"/zlqfbnRk85lAqt5ouKdA0JiQZRG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cast - Ouija Board, Ouija Board","credit_id":"5cb76bf292514108dbf6122b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathy Burke","original_name":"Kathy Burke","popularity":0.5871,"profile_path":"/q3z7nP1ryyGuwixShrBmghcmm0F.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cast - Ouija Board, Ouija Board","credit_id":"5cb76c070e0a266ba2ef830f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":577600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Rourke","original_name":"Andy Rourke","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":"/aoJ0vqTsewg8x2mWZ71sf24kVGS.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb76d5f92514108dbf6143a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":577602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Joyce","original_name":"Mike Joyce","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/giEATfEQ09pLq6yhY0W6lfSsSKP.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb76d6b92514108cef61d45","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":577604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Gannon","original_name":"Craig Gannon","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/bAFmsHZowbZYacmFctOXkE2dkLl.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb76d77c3a3686b0b846510","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Broad","original_name":"Tim Broad","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53831b800e0a2624b700c706","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0944206","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zARQbO5H3Ql1P9413AsQwQaqQen.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
