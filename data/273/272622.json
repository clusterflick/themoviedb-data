For Weiss, the plague means the «extinction of everything that makes life miserable and low and freedom along with it. Unbeknownst to him, he has won the support of a patron who is of the exact opposite opinion: for Johannes Wagner, the plague is an organising principle, and, aided by his agent Moosbrugger, he is able to smuggle a new number onto the programme. Whereas Ottocaro Weiss means to represent the plague theatrically, what appears on stage is the scientific reality of the rat-borne infestation.","popularity":0.4823,"poster_path":"/ztU0ONrbz3Jwv7sBLq6lWHc5scP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death of the Flea Circus Director","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Ottocaro Weiss reformiert seine Firma","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La mort du directeur du cirque de puces","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"A morte do director do circo de pulgas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Simon","original_name":"François Simon","popularity":0.13,"profile_path":"/pCtF5h39ho4LLYerfOnv0MB8ywu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5564285292514151c30038ba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Gogel","original_name":"Paul Gogel","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"55642872925141130e0054e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norbert Schwientek","original_name":"Norbert Schwientek","popularity":0.1382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"55642877c3a368071f001095","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janine Weill","original_name":"Janine Weill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"55642881c3a36874e20002f5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gothard Dietrich","original_name":"Gothard Dietrich","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5564288cc3a368740e00302b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1286046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerhard Dorfer","original_name":"Gerhard Dorfer","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":"/iN7aHS149xNHePHpCyzm6uG8q2p.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"55642898c3a3680532000e97","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Kner","original_name":"Peter Kner","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"556428a09251410608000a77","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Rottsieper","original_name":"Wolfgang Rottsieper","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"556428aac3a36874e20002fc","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Koerfer","original_name":"Thomas Koerfer","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/hKvm3UvmOIORecDu7f2y1zFvxO4.jpg","credit_id":"5386cfdcc3a3681ada00258c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11630,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bertolt Brecht","original_name":"Bertolt Brecht","popularity":0.2837,"profile_path":"/cFfD5goJjn9fZ5opYbHoSzDBxsZ.jpg","credit_id":"556428c492514151c30038c6","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19054,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Renato Berta","original_name":"Renato Berta","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/fXjRoyeehudjs0kqsMv5yBt7b0U.jpg","credit_id":"57ffcd5f9251412eb3000fc7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0070811","wikidata_id":"Q121096382","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1772,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ztU0ONrbz3Jwv7sBLq6lWHc5scP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1266}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10181,"name":"based on play or musical"},{"id":188959,"name":"plague"},{"id":214712,"name":"bubonic plague"},{"id":214713,"name":"flea circus"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
