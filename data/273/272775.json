FOR SPACIOUS SKY is the inspiring story, based on actual events, of three lost brothers finding their way back to each other – one from hate, one from addiction and one from discrimination. Eli, an ex-con white supremacist struggling to start his life over, and Clay, a gay novelist, must set aside their differences for the day to bring their drug-addicted younger brother, Kevin, to rehab. On this day of our nation’s most important decision these three estranged brothers find themselves at a similar crossroad and must choose to remain broken or change. Set against the sweeping landscape of rural America, FOR SPACIOUS SKY is a story of renewal, redemption and hope defying all odds.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Spacious Skys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
