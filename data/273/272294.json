Forzano based on Dante's Divine Comedy. Third part of his opera Triptych. The plot is based on canto XXX of \"Inferno\" from \"The Divine Comedy\", which are dedicated to the rogue and deceiver Gianni Schicchi, who was punished for his sins: he impersonated a dying rich man in order to make a forged will on his behalf. Gianni Schicchi is Puccini's only comic opera, a brilliant example of a modern opera buffa based on the tradition of Verdi's Falstaff. The most expressive recitative, bubbling melody, sharp character, impetuous tempo distinguish her music.
