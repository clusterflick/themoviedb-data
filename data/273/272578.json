A dysfunctional but talented high school hoops team tries to hold itself together. Graced with a handful of sharp shooters and savvy ball-handlers, they also struggle, both on and off the court, in a deteriorating public school system and the turbulence of life in the Boston inner city: rival gangs, a chilling murder rate, destructive families, and the struggle to stay in school and on the team. Closing in on the end of the season, the team has a shot at a state championship and an undefeated season for the first time in history.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/eousWWJbZMeuGeHFjaqm7ZT2my5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Push: Madison vs. Madison","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3183687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudy Hypolite","original_name":"Rudy Hypolite","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61105868255dba004650c850","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3183687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudy Hypolite","original_name":"Rudy Hypolite","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6110587638765100604aa5a9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3183687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudy Hypolite","original_name":"Rudy Hypolite","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6110587e8d1b8e005c036dec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1446261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Pecci","original_name":"Mike Pecci","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6110588a3876510048b4d1d4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2543304,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris O'Coin","original_name":"Chris O'Coin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611058963876510048b4d1f3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2704888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malik Williams","original_name":"Malik Williams","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611058bc8d1b8e0072749590","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3191337,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dennis G.
