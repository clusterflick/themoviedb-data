Matthew Kang, a young management consultant (Yoon) is struck by a car and sustains a serious concussion. Terminated by his employer and dumped by his vaguely leftist bohemian girlfriend, Matthew derives a wicked sense of humor from the weirdness of his own situation, and in the process slowly rediscovers himself and life's deeper meanings.","popularity":0.0585,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Post Concussion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474152,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Yoon","original_name":"Daniel Yoon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd2bd2226c56017d6ec6eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0246159","wikidata_id":"Q122888634","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
