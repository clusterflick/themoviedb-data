On a tip that the old town theater will be shut down, Marlee cooks up a plan to save the stage and make a difference through the power of musical theater! With a cast of costume-clad townies, massive props and a 20-foot robot rabbit - \"Up With Bunnies\" is hatched! There's only one thing missing - the star of the show! When news spreads that singing sensation Cassie Cassava (Melinda Dolittle) is arriving to perform in her hometown church's Easter service, Marlee gets worried. Concerned about the competition, she schemes to steal the starlet for her own pageant! But when things go haywire, will it be curtains for Marlee's dreams - or will she discover the true meaning of Easter and what helping others is really all about?","popularity":1.5308,"poster_path":"/3iJzs2qApGLEOcQx9hXgjY8wOb0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3204,"logo_path":"/kHOVsKg00Fn4hixW7UwMwrng4sj.png","name":"Big Idea Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":62214,"logo_path":"/4KXmUoAGJtfRS7VHQV8d9yePKku.png","name":"Huhu Studios","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VeggieTales: Twas the Night Before Easter","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"VeggieTales - Twas the Night Before Easter","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Nawrocki","original_name":"Mike Nawrocki","popularity":0.2638,"profile_path":"/30Su5P2XK9F91YGZ8MDQqGCPzgx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Larry The Cucumber (voice)","credit_id":"642af632c04429021306b222","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Vischer","original_name":"Phil Vischer","popularity":0.1667,"profile_path":"/8qp9W0m8ZspnfeV2T71td6LWmsr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bob the Tomato (voice)","credit_id":"642af6409cc67b05bf700e86","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3992588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melinda Doolittle","original_name":"Melinda Doolittle","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Cassie Cassava (voice)","credit_id":"642af66bc0442901e818269c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":562904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cydney Trent","original_name":"Cydney Trent","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/rHakfp5993v2iytDgHNVQjI0lJ1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Marlee Meade (Petunia) (voice)","credit_id":"642af685fc653800b47b50e0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":592388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keri Pisapia","original_name":"Keri Pisapia","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/398DkRLCFUd33twFNGATfBPyRPo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Homeless Mom/Mrs. Clark/Laura Carrot (voice)","credit_id":"642af6d7c0a30800d3b9b3e1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":562903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megan Murphy","original_name":"Megan Murphy","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Madame Blueberry (voice)","credit_id":"642af6e2c044290298cfc087","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian K.
