Following a short live-action opening portion, featured are two extended marionette segments, the first dramatizing Clement Moore's \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\", the second reverently telling the Nativity story; the two stories are staged in classic, traditional style.  From 1953 onward, for several years, The Spirit of Christmas was broadcast in the intended region multiple times per holiday season. It was also available as a 16mm film licensed to schools for showings to students. This film often is misstated to have originally been broadcast in 1950.","popularity":0.592,"poster_path":"/qLYg0edXPk8ftbOJp65XVaPxXHy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111644,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stringtime Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Spirit of Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Scourby","original_name":"Alexander Scourby","popularity":0.24,"profile_path":"/uPpBJ11bObJc7piXl2e2Lbt4OuU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Clement Moore / 'Nativity' Narrator (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"567f0703c3a3686075008daf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1553961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mabel Beaton","original_name":"Mabel Beaton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567f06ebc3a3684be300b101","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1553961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mabel Beaton","original_name":"Mabel Beaton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bfa87d5c3a368139802d204","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0392794","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":937,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qLYg0edXPk8ftbOJp65XVaPxXHy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1991,"name":"santa claus"},{"id":207089,"name":"nativity"},{"id":207317,"name":"christmas"},{"id":209220,"name":"live action and animation"},{"id":234074,"name":"marionettes"},{"id":246017,"name":"television special"},{"id":255088,"name":"christmas special"},{"id":273278,"name":"holiday special"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania broadcast region","release_date":"1953-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
