Traumatized by continuous family dramas, having experienced the disappointments of firs love, Maria decides to go up the mountain to a holiday home. There she meets a conceited architect, a shy teacher, a jurist, and a timid journalist (all of them representatives of the intelligentsia) who are domineered by the manager of the holiday home and his 'problems'. Maria's resignation changes into a rebellion against impersonal submission and sheep-like compliance with those who hold power.","popularity":0.1667,"poster_path":"/ttInqQbL1kaELJKwmRBVnRmjLf2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boyana
