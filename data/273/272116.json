Originally intended for every April, it was rescheduled to March in 2007. Though NJPW also runs the annual G1 Climax tournament, the NJC is different in that it is single-elimination, whereas the G1 is a round-robin. Like the G1 however, the winner of the tournament receives a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship; this stipulation was added in 2006. In 2014, the winner was given the right to choose whether to challenge for the IWGP Heavyweight or the IWGP Intercontinental Championship.","popularity":0.5065,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NJPW New Japan Cup 2014","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1237802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinsuke Nakamura","original_name":"Shinsuke Nakamura","popularity":0.3733,"profile_path":"/l5tY8dfwg6c3O97YRNEUQLODltz.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"538428a70e0a2624c700e4e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1277105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fale Simitaitoko","original_name":"Fale Simitaitoko","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":"/38GzOBeXN1v2nkcHPhKKNNN9sQX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bad Luck Fale","credit_id":"538428c70e0a2624c000e6d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shelton Benjamin","original_name":"Shelton Benjamin","popularity":0.2226,"profile_path":"/7SEPSQdXNLUBSTtnNFPXakX0Fmg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"538428da0e0a2624b400e5c9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minoru Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木みのる","popularity":0.2285,"profile_path":"/2KSaJNvXjCmu8Q5RQT6oBed6b7B.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"538428f60e0a2657cd006e70","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5970,"name":"wrestling"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
