Through director Carolina Rivas' sensitive lens, we discover the private world of all eight members of the family. As their dramas unfold, we catch a glimpse of their constant struggles and the small, endearing details that sustain them, including olive trees, two small donkeys and their many friendships. Constructed with a combination of verité scenes and re-enactments, this poignant and richly crafted film offers its audience a much needed opportunity to reflect on the effects of racial segregation, the meaning of borders and the absurdity of war","popularity":0.0705,"poster_path":"/9ELFCpU8UtolSHtoEGGqCXWzSQL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Primavera Kin","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2006-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Colour of Olives","video":false,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Rivas","original_name":"Carolina Rivas","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5385ebc5c3a3681ad7001262","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Rivas","original_name":"Carolina Rivas","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf41f240e0a2621fbc9964e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0829124","wikidata_id":"Q7726849","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1304,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/9ELFCpU8UtolSHtoEGGqCXWzSQL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":924},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/b37gvoUbtPzbB9fM3IcWlaUj1hA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":810},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/7arkkHqgkHLDlbHwGWYXxFPZQHs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":998}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
