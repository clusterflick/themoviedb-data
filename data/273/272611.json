Since there are no models in the canons of American literature and film for the depiction of the destruction of an entire city, the story of that migration and extended exile from home demands the invention of narrative forms appropriate to this unique catastrophe. The film tries to find a narrative in a meditation on the liquid state. In just forty sentences of narration and their accompanying images, 40 Views of Water seeks to express the sense of disorientation, journey, and sheltering we New Orleanians experienced after the levees fell.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"40 Views of Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Katz","original_name":"Morgan Katz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"5386bcd8c3a3681ad7002311","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325448,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Uyen Vu","original_name":"Uyen Vu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Girl on the bridge","credit_id":"5386bcebc3a3681aea002226","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Varisco","original_name":"Tom Varisco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5386bcfbc3a3681af000237b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325450,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Biguenet","original_name":"John Biguenet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5386bd0dc3a3681add002442","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325448,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Uyen Vu","original_name":"Uyen Vu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5386bd20c3a3681aea00222f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Varisco","original_name":"Tom Varisco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5386bd33c3a3681ad700231f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325448,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Uyen Vu","original_name":"Uyen Vu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5386bd49c3a3681af30024f9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325448,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Uyen Vu","original_name":"Uyen Vu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5386bd62c3a3681af0002387","department":"Sound","job":"Sound mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325448,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Uyen Vu","original_name":"Uyen Vu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5386bd72c3a3681ada0023ee","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325448,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Uyen Vu","original_name":"Uyen Vu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5386bd89c3a3681ad700232b","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1825638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
