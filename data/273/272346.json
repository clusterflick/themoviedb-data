Over his 41 years of service in the Israeli Air Force, Uri downed many enemy planes and he can't hide the pride he feels: 'I'm the only pilot who downed planes in all the wars. Two of them hit the cockpit.' Yet Uri claims to have never gloated: 'I was never happy afterwards. I like to show the enemy some respect. ' Battle-hardened, he admits to 'flourishing in wars.' For him, the key character components of any good soldier are an ability to adapt and an understanding of sacrifice.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Best Pilot in the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
