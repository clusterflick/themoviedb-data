Each component, from the first slice of bread to the last, is dropped dramatically from a height, before bouncing and settling into place in slow motion. Mayonnaise, then ham, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and the final slice on top. This perfect yet uncanny choreography reads like an exaggerated, perverse take on ‘food-porn’ obsessed advertising campaigns. These sequences repeat, the sound gradually incorporates saws and machinery, echos from empty environments, pianos breaking, smashes, crashes and mechanical crescendos like jet engines alongside eerie drones, bells, and hard rummaging noises. Another piece of bread lands, some rubber baby dolls fall onto it, some brown slop, a blanket, denim jeans, some businessmen in suits, and more slop. Ketchup, then a union jack, all encased in the final layer of bread that falls to the top of the pile to the sound of a tolling bell. Infinite continuation, loop.","popularity":0.1277,"poster_path":"/rOqZ1hDhdQeBtUnRZvrAnFq0Zea.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Atkins","original_name":"Ed Atkins","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yaFe7uQGwGBNJEVNtdtHdBn6oyf.jpg","credit_id":"663f7c2d36af500b7b9b2e69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rOqZ1hDhdQeBtUnRZvrAnFq0Zea.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":166676,"name":"contemporary art"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":278823,"name":"3d animation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"De visita en la Bienal de Venecia 2019: Ed Atkins,  Old Food.","key":"yZFxw_xhK1E","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-06-06T23:10:12.000Z","id":"663f7b8abe2294d80647df55"}]}}}
