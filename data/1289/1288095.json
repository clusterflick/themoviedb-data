There is no “story” or “narrative”, rather a kind of atmosphere and ambience in which a feeling for the town and its present and former inhabitants, and compassion for Gary, are generated by means more akin to music and poetry than narrative/story-telling.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qyw9jzxqoxVp1U5TrYB22GO3KdB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walkerville","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2666029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Winterholler","original_name":"Gary Winterholler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"663d81cad0674f2601dc2320","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4705162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Jost","original_name":"Jon Jost","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d819d3349fba34a79100a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qyw9jzxqoxVp1U5TrYB22GO3KdB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
