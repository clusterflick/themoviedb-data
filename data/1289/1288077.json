Raffael leaves the psychiatric hospital, curious to see if art and creativity could help him survive in the outside world. With no money and only a vague plan, he says goodbye to his family and embarks on an epic, poignant, often hilarious journey around the globe. He travels with the screw to the Dachau concentration camp, Van Gogh’s grave, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Ganges River in India. Along the way Raffael finds patrons, lovers, and friends - but his son feels abandoned. Can Rafael reinvent himself, his art, and his family?","popularity":0.4248,"poster_path":"/100iF2reDp8goE3nEUHOeMmRyxH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Missing Screw","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4704906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raffael Lomas","original_name":"Raffael Lomas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"663d6fd23349fba34a78f0aa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4704911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nitsan Bar Tal","original_name":"Nitsan Bar Tal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d7006532723af3a01fda5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4704919,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Halil Efrat","original_name":"Halil Efrat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d703bcdb342e0257e774c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4704925,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Tenzin Yougyal","original_name":"Tenzin Yougyal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d707d0f2c7c19a6c72759","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4704912,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Liki Tapuach","original_name":"Liki Tapuach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d701b42d3a002d8c733a3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4704922,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joel Kipnis","original_name":"Joel Kipnis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d70656899a8d26adbf2fd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4704911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nitsan Bar Tal","original_name":"Nitsan Bar Tal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d704fe0d47a677c30386b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31286083","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.743,"height":1058,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/100iF2reDp8goE3nEUHOeMmRyxH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":786},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hAo5GbN8lp2uF2F6AXSPNiTRFPj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":571}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5973,"name":"journey around the world"},{"id":177146,"name":"meaning of life"},{"id":223609,"name":"dysfunctional life"},{"id":257258,"name":"quest for identity"},{"id":262228,"name":"observational documentary"},{"id":310315,"name":"travel documentary"},{"id":348825,"name":"journey and escape"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Finish date","release_date":"2024-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"My Missing Screw Trailer","key":"943002976","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-05-05T17:27:15.000Z","id":"66befc50558aa8282205e7b5"}]}}}
