Atefeh Sahaaleh's death sentence was for \"crimes against chastity\". Despite Iran being a signatory to an international convention that promises not to sentence to death or execute those under 18, permission was obtained from Iran's Supreme Court by the local mullah and head of the city's administration to do exactly that. Eyewitness accounts and dramatic reconstructions, plus undercover filming in Atefah's hometown tell the powerful story of the life and tragic death of an ordinary girl.","popularity":0.4267,"poster_path":"/kFcrS8i2RVKJxW6O0B7bUa2nnAj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102273,"logo_path":"/6Xh9LWt7lAKxy2dptUgPS47CFJV.png","name":"Wild Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Execution of a Teenage Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411470,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Serter Alkaya","original_name":"Serter Alkaya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e231478a77b1bace8cb38","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1165700,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Frank Burgess","original_name":"Frank Burgess","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e23335661280d7dfb27c1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1359851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monica Garnsey","original_name":"Monica Garnsey","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/rZEfLBS0JyUvBkKq24VUbZRQY11.jpg","credit_id":"663e234363679ef9a0da9956","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4705839,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arash Sahami","original_name":"Arash Sahami","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e235e5661280d7dfb27e1","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1015910,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Hamann","original_name":"Paul Hamann","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e2161029372a7e451326d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1359851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monica Garnsey","original_name":"Monica Garnsey","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/rZEfLBS0JyUvBkKq24VUbZRQY11.jpg","credit_id":"663e214f78a77b1bace8ca30","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2107755,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Simon Ffrench","original_name":"Simon Ffrench","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e2e453042f35be3fb4c19","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":792,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kFcrS8i2RVKJxW6O0B7bUa2nnAj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11523,"name":"capital punishment"},{"id":190334,"name":"theocracy"},{"id":210329,"name":"sharia law"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC2","release_date":"2006-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
