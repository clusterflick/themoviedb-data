The film focuses on key theatre productions that challenged the dominant Afrikaner identity, using provocative imagery to reimagine the role and identity of the Afrikaner in democratic South Africa.  The plays explore unexamined areas of Afrikaner culture and reveal that there is no homogenous perspective. The key theatre productions explored are TRITS (Mis, Mirakel, Drif) (1992â€“1994), Donkerland (1996), Drie Susters, Twee (1997), Boklied (1998), Ek, Anna van Wyk (1999), Aars! (2001), Saad (2007), Ons vir Jou (2008), Sakrament (2009), Die kortsondige raklewe van Anastasia W. (2010) and Balbesit (2013).","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reflections in a broken mirror","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amber Fox-Martin","original_name":"Amber Fox-Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663ee0355eb963123908b40a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amber Fox-Martin","original_name":"Amber Fox-Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663ee04e6a4be7bc02d90430","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Theron","original_name":"Philip Theron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663ee042d2eb8e0fa0a3b54a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amber Fox-Martin","original_name":"Amber Fox-Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663ee05d7079d0078a08b896","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28087805","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
