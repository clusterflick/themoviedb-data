There are 13 videos from 2 to 12 minutes in length. The audio consists of static, hypnotic synth loops made by both (more characteristic of Shortell than Lambkin) and the video consists of the \"motion paintings\" themselves, a setup of mirrored or clear plastic surfaces with a stream of water running over it, to which are gradually added various dyes and viscous substances to create a spontaneous abstract painting of sorts.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motion Painting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
