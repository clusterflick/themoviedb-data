Unlike she was planning, she gets rejected from her prospected university’s music program. As the rejection settles in, she realizes she’s truly growing up - having to deal with the violin in the process. While working to overcome her burnout, she comes to terms with the fact that she will be leaving the place that she grew up in for the first time ever. With her mother taking notice of Elsie’s downcast attitude, and her older brother back home to visit from college, she must come to the understanding that change doesn’t always have to be a bad thing.","popularity":0.0389,"poster_path":"/gqPCEDylos1yZtBru880P8Kv9SL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":200295,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of Colorado
