There is no doubt that these two are particularly memorable for Ishii, but how should we as an audience perceive these acts? Then something occurred to me. In my work \"Guiding Star\", there is a part where I walk through an underground passage at night during a trip in Hokuriku. That place was Kanazawa. Lately I've been visiting Kanazawa every year for the Maki Asakawa live video screening, but most of the time I travel from Kansai to Kanazawa, or vice versa, by express bus. Then, the bus always passes through that underground passage. Ah, it was here. With that thought in mind, I play with the memories of that trip for a while, no longer happy or sad, but dry and dry. It might be something similar. However, in my case, unlike Ishii's narration in the story, I feel like \"it somehow continued to live.\" M.Yamazaki","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ikOItGUN9a7j2KeOUFFPaeFRWcl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Boat","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2542740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideto Ishii","original_name":"Hideto Ishii","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e4ce9d13a3341ce799204","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jnnjs3RT5JaX84WnrtnhIo9iyTY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1435,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ikOItGUN9a7j2KeOUFFPaeFRWcl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":957}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
