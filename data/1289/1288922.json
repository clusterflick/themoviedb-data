Maaim채is a song from Mari Kalkun's new album Stoonia lood, released in September 2023. It talks about the contradictory relationship between man and nature.

Climate change, overpopulation, habitat loss for wildlife, and loss of species diversity are concerns that affect and speak to all of us, regardless of our geographical location.
