Salcha Elementary School, along with the help of Tanana Valley Watershed Association, conducted a 10-year scientific project with students to study the effects the levee had on Piledriver Slough. Tori Brannan - the filmmaker's mother - is a retired principal at Salcha Elementary and was the project's centerpiece. She shares her experiences with the project, the community, and how her daughter's involvement strengthened their relationship.","popularity":2.144,"poster_path":"/6U2UX76jDUCWWsEE1Px3pf5V2Gd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story of rivers, science, community, family, and a bridge...","title":"The Story of a Slough","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4705098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Henszey","original_name":"Bob Henszey","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"663d7c97d6996c8da27e97c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4705102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christy Everett","original_name":"Christy Everett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"663d7cb5cf1b151d997e906f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tori Brannan","original_name":"Tori Brannan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"663d7cc16156fd91a1da1c5d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teslin Brannan","original_name":"Teslin Brannan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"663d7ccae0d47a677c30562b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3031806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dawson Brannan","original_name":"Dawson Brannan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d7ce186e5454682020e22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3031806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dawson Brannan","original_name":"Dawson Brannan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d7ced914d573978a41644","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3031806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dawson Brannan","original_name":"Dawson Brannan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d7d08f56a7dbb62dc10b8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Brannan","original_name":"David Brannan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d7d26d6996c8da27e990a","department":"Camera","job":"Drone Cinematographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4705111,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olexy","original_name":"Olexy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663d7d36d0674f2601dc19b8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.784,"height":962,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tT3sSEQv60hFoECi8qbZqsV1SE0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1716},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1fUyMqofHiYyzp4nUFUKLYlqrMe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1919},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j4ft0FTQvkA6URblBBNW5GIft8h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1919},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5b8OEr2MdONHZ8lxzV3lwGjV7Od.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1919},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cXDphl4DxoA6beCTxSwQFKrSYDH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1919}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":955,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6U2UX76jDUCWWsEE1Px3pf5V2Gd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":641}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1261,"name":"river"},{"id":5890,"name":"community"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":245485,"name":"rivers"},{"id":258384,"name":"relationships"},{"id":287067,"name":"science"},{"id":332286,"name":"slough"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
