He arrives late for dinner and his wife aims a blow at him. He touches her with the magic wand, but, alas, with the wrong end, producing two wives instead of making one disappear. The wives combine forces, take the magic wand away and pound the unfortunate Whiffles until he apologizes.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rigadin and the Magic Wand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Prince","original_name":"Charles Prince","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/xIJtjes51xjkr6VjEz50sbPv0Yi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rigadin","credit_id":"663f2c45cea4ab53fe47b30a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":588681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Germaine Reuver","original_name":"Germaine Reuver","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/vWXdbYN45PDuSsRuIiCwCHNpdlt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wife","credit_id":"663f2c6d20f1e4b3e0a400de","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Monca","original_name":"Georges Monca","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663f2c837dfa2e5432d5e784","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0427745","wikidata_id":"Q59140052","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1912-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rigadin et la baguette magique (1912) Pathé","key":"v-FWhtL4dC8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-05-11T04:15:54.000Z","id":"663f2cee196edc987625e1d0"}]}}}
