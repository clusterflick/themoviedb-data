We prove by construction the existence of infinitely many adversarial training classifiers on over-parameterized DNNs that obtain arbitrarily small adversarial training error (overfitting), whereas achieving good robust generalization error under certain conditions concerning the data quality, well separated, and perturbation level. This construction is optimal and thus points out the fundamental limits of DNNs under adversarial training with statistical guarantees. Part of this talk comes from our recent work.","popularity":0.0847,"poster_path":"/uCEoNwYwtTxeyJ4UmigmsOiLYFV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228630,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of Warwick","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Analysis","title":"Can overfitted deep neural networks in adversarial training generalize? – An approximation viewpoint","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fanghui Liu","original_name":"Fanghui Liu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"663e91adec544462166cc5ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Engineering Research Building","original_name":"Engineering Research Building","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"663e951165702752cf3c9550","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Room 514","original_name":"Room 514","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"663e951c1b96f4269e3c94f6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuchen Zeng","original_name":"Yuchen Zeng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"663e952fa1402e298e742372","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706595,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fanghui Liu","original_name":"Fanghui Liu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e954a0abdbc06f9516fc7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fanghui Liu","original_name":"Fanghui Liu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e920665a0a891892f711c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fanghui Liu","original_name":"Fanghui Liu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e95400cc0be18da742399","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3PmEk3OEMibFLI2O9rwFAvTHhMl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uCEoNwYwtTxeyJ4UmigmsOiLYFV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Analysis","release_date":"2024-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Can overfitted deep neural networks in adversarial training generalize? – An approximation viewpoint","key":"6mqGmNRo7Po","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-03-08T02:15:18.000Z","id":"663e919bdb680feef287c3f2"}]}}}
