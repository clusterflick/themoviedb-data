Otto copes by immersing himself in work, seeking solace in the distraction it provides, while Rebecca grapples with the pain more openly, finding it difficult to move forward. Their contrasting coping mechanisms create a divide between them as they confront familial and financial challenges. Faced with growing tensions, Rebecca and Otto must realise the importance of finding new ways to understand and support each other, or run the risk of drifting further apart.","popularity":0.0438,"poster_path":"/2lhBo7H1ToJENQV4cwF5hJ3NWPa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaman Theron","original_name":"Shaman Theron","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rebecca","credit_id":"663ee700e8e260851ab5bd84","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rama Buisson","original_name":"Rama Buisson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Otto","credit_id":"663ee716da58cf1d0fa3c2d7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4314125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ollie Madsen","original_name":"Ollie Madsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663ee72ce695294612dbd98f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4314125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ollie Madsen","original_name":"Ollie Madsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663ee737098b2a7ea125936c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511876,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Faith Cruz","original_name":"Faith Cruz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663ee76ae8e260851ab5bdf4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4706833,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Holly Stephens","original_name":"Holly Stephens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663ee758c9a4c10fa1dbdcbf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2lhBo7H1ToJENQV4cwF5hJ3NWPa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
