Excised from normal context and imbued with an impossible cosmetic sheen, these crystalline forms are conjured in colours that range from the surreally heightened to the deliberately banal. A line of toy-like objects – a train, a giraffe on wheels, a boat – trundles along on an impossibly turquoise plane. Parasitically followed by a swirling black fly, the unfolding narrative is one of production, consumption and saturation. Elsewhere, the naked human backside of the title (cropped and anonymous) is shown with a luridly-glowing orchid tucked between its buttocks. At points, the imagery takes on the semblance of a painting or diagram, both formulaic ‘analogues’ of reality, like the video itself, implying the knotty weight of a Cézanne still life.","popularity":0.1251,"poster_path":"/lvFKACE2I6qbpjXASS8li4999FD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orchids, or a hemispherical bottom","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4707992,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"helen marten","original_name":"helen marten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663fa9e2b3fd28ce22c079a3","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Marten","original_name":"Helen Marten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663fa9d163cc7a9e50591fa7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4854044","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lvFKACE2I6qbpjXASS8li4999FD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":166766,"name":"digital video"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":297442,"name":"animation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Helen Marten, Orchids, or a hemispherical bottom, 2013","key":"86501892","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2014-02-12T11:28:35.000Z","id":"663fa971dad8f6f5681ff4bf"}]}}}
