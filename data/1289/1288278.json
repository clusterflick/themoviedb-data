Maria is a 24 hour caregiver. Once every 4 weeks, Maria leaves behind her Romanian village and embarks on a journey of over 1000 kilometres in order to care for elderly people in Austria.  In the meantime, her own aging parents are left to their own device. Her husband Daniel also looks back on many years of hard labour abroad. He now takes charge of the household. Their two sons, however, envisage a completely different future. After 4 weeks Maria returns, yet she is not to stay. One day, she would like to use the money she has earned abroad to open a small bed and breakfast in order to be able to quit traveling.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/aZU04PN2rU6vxvOzWPMOOf6Fs26.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2024-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tomorrow I Leave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Maine Ma Duc - Tomorrow I Leave","type":"distributor`s catalog film title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285672,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lenja Gathmann","original_name":"Lenja Gathmann","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e2850681fb1e1f1a951f5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362624,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johannes Schmelzer-Ziringer","original_name":"Johannes Schmelzer-Ziringer","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e284342d3a002d8c7cf19","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984613,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maria Lisa Pichler","original_name":"Maria Lisa Pichler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e27e47601152fab0f9d08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tizza Covi","original_name":"Tizza Covi","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e285c264086cef10277de","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3721906,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lukas Schöffel","original_name":"Lukas Schöffel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e28210f2c7c19a6c7c39f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3721906,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lukas Schöffel","original_name":"Lukas Schöffel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e282eadd7011c3330e1ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984613,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maria Lisa Pichler","original_name":"Maria Lisa Pichler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e2839842dae1673fb369f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35587542","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aZU04PN2rU6vxvOzWPMOOf6Fs26.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Diagonale Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Duisburg Film Week","release_date":"2024-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
