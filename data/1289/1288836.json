In the sultry, scorching August heat, he ventures by bicycle into a semi-deserted Rome, populated by a few surviving students, many elderly people and foreigners who cannot afford to vacation. Andrea intends to reach a supermarket where he can buy cans of tuna fish with which to continue accumulating points that will win him the mysterious “Happiness Coupon.” But if, among magical encounters, vicissitudes and bizarre happenings, reaching happiness is always a dream, pursuing it may turn out to be a nightmare... Besides, are we sure that, as they say, happiness makes one happy?\"","popularity":0.1767,"poster_path":"/2jY36SAktWWREj8dUK6BqdZNpUy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pirata Manifatture Cinematografiche","origin_country":""},{"id":228688,"logo_path":null,"name":"Associazione Culturale Têtes de Bois","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coupon: The Film About Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milena Vukotić","original_name":"Milena Vukotić","popularity":0.7687,"profile_path":"/k4dsiarmq3s5kryz7MxSIQcrPRR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"663fbb1d6450048a4c1ff6be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4610464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pier Luigi Bersani","original_name":"Pier Luigi Bersani","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"663fbb3c340e9a9a7e365a58","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1071367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Satta","original_name":"Andrea Satta","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"663fbbf495ca8e60237e8b5b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Lombardi","original_name":"Paolo Lombardi","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":"/iThIQ6hgq2OhOu33bXCNCdMpYiy.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"663fbc0b2b51a824841ff6b4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072578,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alessandro Bonifazi","original_name":"Alessandro Bonifazi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"663fbc183ff44c8b157e8b5b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4708151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Grazia Calandrone","original_name":"Maria Grazia Calandrone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"663fbc23cecf3463cff9fe0f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agostino Ferrente","original_name":"Agostino Ferrente","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663fbb0b18ad1e75881ff68e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agostino Ferrente","original_name":"Agostino Ferrente","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663fbbe03709175e0c67511e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1071367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Satta","original_name":"Andrea Satta","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663fbbcea010a760f7fecc76","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2jY36SAktWWREj8dUK6BqdZNpUy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"41° TORINO FILM FESTIVAL 2023","release_date":"2023-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
