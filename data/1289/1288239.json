Uncontrolled emotional manifestations, isolation, hallucinations, no one wants to have anything to do with him. No one needs him: neither the state nor his relatives. To no one, except the manager of the boarding house. The Soldier's case was of particular interest to a government official who suddenly arrived at the boarding house. After all, the boy's visions are not just hallucinations, they are omens and help to find out the fate of other missing soldiers. It turns out that this civil servant has his own pain that he hides. Oddly enough, the life destinies of these different people unexpectedly intersect.","popularity":0.0976,"poster_path":"/hY7lMJCmaySJwFWtMHfvkR0VE1g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Soldier","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3126323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavlo Shpehun","original_name":"Pavlo Shpehun","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/qjp1tUHWTkYpHdUEj6V0JBi6eon.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Soldier","credit_id":"663e1033aca065f3e5cdacc7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2244633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serhii Denha","original_name":"Сергій Деньга","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/y0iIkLBUVm482iaG2eH3rRlkDWP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Official","credit_id":"663e10641a3d02a1407984d0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1500321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serhii Kalantai","original_name":"Сергій Калантай","popularity":0.2217,"profile_path":"/xNzv53GOuaVBCIJayr2GNM844MG.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Chief Doctor","credit_id":"663e10947cf2e8c882e8c4b3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812559,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrey Babik","original_name":"Andrey Babik","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e0f5e333236d859a48f20","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3186445,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Danyl Dedkov","original_name":"Danil Dedkov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e0e8918e80f9a66da9890","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4705748,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tetiana Lazareva","original_name":"Tetiana Lazareva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e0fe9264086cef1027041","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3218383,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tanya Dudnik","original_name":"Tanya Dudnik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9gtMLAbZtddwr09nsVzu8SSWP5Y.jpg","credit_id":"663e0fb287cbc6f54fda92d7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3186445,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Danyl Dedkov","original_name":"Danil Dedkov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e139542d3a002d8c7c7c9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30645113","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"61552073424052","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hY7lMJCmaySJwFWtMHfvkR0VE1g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Bulgarian Edition","release_date":"2024-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kyiv, premiere screening","release_date":"2023-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dream City Rivne International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Ukrainian Edition","release_date":"2024-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
