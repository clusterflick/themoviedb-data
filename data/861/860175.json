Michele returns to his hometown \"Rutunn'\" after many years and as an old man. Walking through the streets of his village he arrives at his old house, where memories emerge from the silence and dust: his son still young, his wife, music from another era and a terrace overlooking a limitless horizon. He sinks into the memory, he lives it as if it was all happening here and now. However, he has never been able to return to that house.","popularity":0.4304,"poster_path":"/jpVrv6BYC1hH9Fvcdf8DUP3cwo3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Image
