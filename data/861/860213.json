In the film, Galya walked around emblematic and famous settings in Budapest while wearing the traditional clothes of Romani women and holding a camera in her hands, taking pictures of people walking on the streets. In the five-minute short film, two kinds of material alternate: black-and-white stills, taken by Galya herself, and moving images in colour, made by her supporting team. In the former images we see strangers facing Galyaâ€™s camera, while in the latter, Galya herself is the protagonist as a flaneur who walks on the streets: contemplating, taking pictures and sometimes talking with people.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":158867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Romedia Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2014-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pages of My Book","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Galya Stoyanova","original_name":"Galya Stoyanova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6112e8c3a127e500459ca93e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Galya Stoyanova","original_name":"Galya Stoyanova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6112e7dcb04605005dc21380","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Galya Stoyanova","original_name":"Galya Stoyanova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6112e7ecc7a7e0002d39539b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
