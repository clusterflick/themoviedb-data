For decades illegal wildlife poaching by both subsistence and bush meat gangs has led to the government declaring this community’s homeland “depleted” of wildlife.  The chief finds help in the form of a safari operator and they work together to bring stability to the community. But all was not well. Disease, food stability, and rampant alcoholism hamper basic needs like health care and education. Even young girls, just after reaching puberty, are sold by their parents as child brides in order to feed their family for one year. Dark forces including South African land speculators, criminal poaching gangs, and her own people conspire against the chief. Even elements from the modern world work against the chief’s wishes.  Will the chief and her community see success?","popularity":0.2547,"poster_path":"/AuNDg5YxCLZ5zUAQjQ8ktBsLL2N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113637,"logo_path":"/pJ9zcB8j32rqy8FGNn9VCy0J2io.png","name":"Baked Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":158851,"logo_path":null,"name":"Firesteel Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZM","name":"Zambia"}],"release_date":"2021-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Killing the Shepherd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193666,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stephen Duringer","original_name":"Stephen Duringer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6112aab497fdec007ffc2680","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193669,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matt Hartle","original_name":"Matt Hartle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6112aae8394a87007586a024","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"TA Opre","original_name":"TA Opre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6112aaa7255dba002f5359f2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"TA Opre","original_name":"TA Opre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6112aa9c255dba002f5359e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193668,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Gordon","original_name":"Robert Gordon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6112aadc394a870046265023","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14023170","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"shepherdsofwildlifesociety","instagram_id":"shepherdsofwildlife","twitter_id":"wildshepherds"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AuNDg5YxCLZ5zUAQjQ8ktBsLL2N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":556}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
