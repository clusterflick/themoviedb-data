Instead, its legacy is memorialized through a compelling point-of-view historical Canadian documentary. From 1971 - 1977, MIDIAN FARM was a back-to-the-land social experiment created by a community of urban baby boomers from Toronto. Part of the youth counterculture movement during a period of social and political re-imagining, its utopian vision eventually collapsed. More than four decades later, filmmaker Liz Marshall unearths a transformative piece of family and Canadian history.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/qLB5U2Qc1hsK1Zy9FL8W2i48vZu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158906,"logo_path":null,"name":"LizMars Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midian Farm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":215726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liz Marshall","original_name":"Liz Marshall","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6113eeafa097dc002ccbd8ed","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":215726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liz Marshall","original_name":"Liz Marshall","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6113eebb1e6489005c61036b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6574626","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qLB5U2Qc1hsK1Zy9FL8W2i48vZu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
