Brought up in a Christian home, he put his trust in Christ as his Saviour at the age of sixteen. He began to pray for and give towards missionary work but soon realised God wanted him to go himself.\r Having trained as a missionary doctor, he was eventually accepted by the London Missionary Society for work in Africa. He left England for Cape Town in December 1840 and there began what must be one of the greatest pioneering missionary works of modern times. For over 32 years, David preached the Gospel, attended the sick and explored a vast area, seeking new routes whereby future missionaries could reach the Africans with the Gospel.\r In 1873 David died and his body was carried for 1000 miles to Zanzibar from where it was brought to England. His remains are buried in Westminster Abbey in London.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zjlt1Dpi90wp9VaJzej9fkiISII.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey of a Lifetime - the story of David Livingstone, Pioneer Missionary and Explorer","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zjlt1Dpi90wp9VaJzej9fkiISII.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":542}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
