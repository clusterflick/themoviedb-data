Unexpectedly, when it was completed, it coincided with the war between the KMT and the Communist Party in Shanghai. Later, the Kuomintang government completely withdrew from Shanghai to Taiwan, and the film crew stayed in Taiwan. The film was also premiered in Taiwan, becoming the first feature film in Taiwanese film history. The episode \"High Mountain Green\" was widely sung that year and became a classic in film music.","popularity":0.2477,"poster_path":"/7aBlt5XnhQNzlAdRjcI1YBM51SM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158917,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shanghai Vientiane Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1950-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Alishan Uprising","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Ying","original_name":"Lee Ying","popularity":0.1718,"profile_path":"/zFeRQ97JwIDxjGHNeEU6MWWK6E6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Wu Feng","credit_id":"61145338f1759c007ec4e3cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Chiao","original_name":"Roy Chiao","popularity":0.519,"profile_path":"/eSeHTbR1SQbF8sBhGjUJZeuVuw2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"611453c3770700002c04bb50","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tien Feng","original_name":"田丰","popularity":0.6094,"profile_path":"/kOCqQYGnBN6bk9jP0cbufsHdWBv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64fd64d66a222700c3b4857b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Ying","original_name":"Chang Ying","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61144d9aa097dc0044b63e13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Cheh","original_name":"張徹","popularity":0.3633,"profile_path":"/5AWIo52OoCXL8zb9pAE62azvTLX.jpg","credit_id":"6114512fcee481004585ed36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Cheh","original_name":"張徹","popularity":0.3633,"profile_path":"/5AWIo52OoCXL8zb9pAE62azvTLX.jpg","credit_id":"61145139a097dc002ccce3dd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0193709","wikidata_id":"Q48928852","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1725,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7aBlt5XnhQNzlAdRjcI1YBM51SM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1150}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
