This first Cantonese-language talkie was based on a successful 1930 stage musical  written by and starring Xue JueXian (Sit KokSin), the plot of which was in turn inspired by a 1929 silent Hollywood romance called \"The Grand Duchess And The Waiter\" which Xue admired.  The film was produced not in Shanghai, by the Tianyi studio, headed by the eldest of the Shaw Brothers, Shao Zuiweng (RunJe Shaw), and was so successful in the Cantonese-speaking parts of China that Shaw moved the Tianyi company to British-administered, Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong to make more Cantonese films in the face of the right-wing Chinese Nationalist government's ban on Cantonese language in favor of Mandarin.  A sequel to Baijin Long was made in 1937, and the film itself was remade in 1947.","popularity":0.2389,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":175337,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tianyi Movie Company","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1933-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baijin Long","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Platinum Dragon","type":"English title translation in literature"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"White Gold Dragon","type":"Another English title translation in literature"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"White Dragon","type":"English translation title for New York censors"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Bajinlong","type":"Alternative post-modern title transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268439,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sit Kok-Sin","original_name":"Sit Kok-Sin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bok GumBing","credit_id":"649f6ccdc390c5010c61bb58","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1523912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tong Suet-hing","original_name":"Tong Suet-hing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jong Yun Leong","credit_id":"649f6d458c0a4800ae236580","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4139569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nai Pon Fee","original_name":"Nai Pon Fee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bok's father","credit_id":"649f6d6681da3900ad2b06e5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4139571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neong Yuk Moy","original_name":"Neong Yuk Moy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jen Joon-Wah","credit_id":"649f6d870cb335011bcae0cf","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1414356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xiaodan Tang","original_name":"Xiaodan Tang","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/nCvAbJOdVBj54fdJ9jHmAlBbwdv.jpg","credit_id":"6115934e35c30a0045bc68b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3609466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sit Kok-Sin","original_name":"Sit Kok-Sin","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/RJlERP40DDBBQzpBLJxzYd6lCK.jpg","credit_id":"649f6e6d81da39012c6e5eeb","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4139591,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"An Wai Wong","original_name":"An Wai Wong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649f6efd0cb33500c4a53499","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3609466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sit Kok-Sin","original_name":"Sit Kok-Sin","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/RJlERP40DDBBQzpBLJxzYd6lCK.jpg","credit_id":"649f6e574a52f800c993c17f","department":"Writing","job":"Musical"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4139587,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jow See Look","original_name":"Jow See Look","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649f6ea5d5191f00ff8b086f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4139590,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shue Tin Lik","original_name":"Shue Tin Lik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649f6ee88c0a4800e477d754","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4139589,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hung Yoo Don","original_name":"Hung Yoo Don","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649f6ec74a52f80145dd8ee1","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11443430","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"},{"id":221307,"name":"chinese opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Shanghai","release_date":"1933-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Distributed by New York Chinese Film Exchange, with no English subtitles.","release_date":"1937-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
