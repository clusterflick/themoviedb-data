In one you can find a picture of the contact between old age and youth. An old man lives in a house in a far away place. Two boys play in the snow. The villa attracts them with its magnetizing mystery. The boys throw snowballs. One of them accidentally hits the window and then terrified little ones see an old man watching them. The child's fear of strangers and old people makes them run away. Only when the path among the trees is already empty, the old gentleman smiles kindly.","popularity":0.0459,"poster_path":"/q3iQf2FP09suorlGb0xkDsKJPOE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2996885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bohdan Mikuć","original_name":"Bohdan Mikuć","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/yxzUaApIbyUtn1SQuggXqX1y8TU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Old Man","credit_id":"6114151409c24c0045052a89","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3194831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Józek Grzymała","original_name":"Józek Grzymała","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Boy 1","credit_id":"61141576a097dc002ccc48e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3194833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antek Grzymała","original_name":"Antek Grzymała","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Boy 2","credit_id":"61141594cee481002e2272af","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166085,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Piotr Sobociński Jr.","original_name":"Piotr Sobociński Jr.","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":"/nuBku5u5GvsWRluLSjhONv5eh1v.jpg","credit_id":"611415bacee481002e227398","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q3iQf2FP09suorlGb0xkDsKJPOE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
