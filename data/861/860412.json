Based on a chivalric romance about three young people imprisoned by a sorceress, Handel’s version is brimming with youthful vigour, humour and tears. The miracle is that Handel, a secretive bachelor, could so vividly depict the delirious highs and savage lows to which love can reduce us all. The cast is led by soprano Francesca Chiejina, direct from the Royal Opera House, and also features William Towers and Tim Morgan in the title role, Rebecca Afonwy-Jones, Jenny Stafford and Harriet Eyley.  This new production with ETO’s period orchestra partner, the Old Street Band, is conducted by Jonathan Peter Kenny, directed by James Conway, and designed by Neil Irish with Rory Beaton and Harry Pizzey.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fjQVHZiZSexrU1ZcfFZfDdIn2CZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handel: Amadigi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fjQVHZiZSexrU1ZcfFZfDdIn2CZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
