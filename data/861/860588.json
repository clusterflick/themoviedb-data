The eternal dance of life embraces two main characters - the Girl and the Knight in various guises (a king, a jester) - the relationship between whom develops on two levels - realistic and symbolic. The visual approach based on medieval engravings, the Scandinavian tradition of wooden sculptures and ornaments as well as the colour scheme carry profound philosophical and symbolic meaning.
