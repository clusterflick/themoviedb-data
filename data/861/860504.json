In this film, Paul Tunge and photographer Egil HÃ¥skjold Larsen venture out into the public and into rooms, to explore modernist buildings in Norwegian society. This audiovisual journey is composed of three short films: Ad Astra, Bauta and Platform. In Ad Astra you will see brutalist church architecture, which is in stark contrast to the traditional church we all know. In Bauta you will soar around Oslo and observe concrete public buildings, while in Platform you will enter modern villas. Sound and image exist in a calm (but also chilling) symbiosis in this portrait of modernistic buildings.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/uTU7aKrxfpMqIMxOZU1JuvQw6Uc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2021-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mind of Modernism","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Tunge","original_name":"Paul Tunge","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/xi1GsTSaOOnL5rAKBNa4TjTL4ZC.jpg","credit_id":"6113ea1b3a9937002820f54f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1683,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uTU7aKrxfpMqIMxOZU1JuvQw6Uc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1122}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
