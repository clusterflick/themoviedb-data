They nibble some flowers and find a bee, which they follow to the hive, which they then proceed to raid.

The bees run him off, and the cubs dig in.","popularity":0.4055,"poster_path":"/nVMV5b4UkrZ7fpkZ3vt0Np6J4Ez.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney
