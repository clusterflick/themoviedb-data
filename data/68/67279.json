BattleGround is an irreverent journey that will challenge the orthodoxies of Left and Right, and highlight the humanity of all sides of the conflict. BattleGround will be a critical film for anyone who wants to understand the powerful forces that are sucking America deeper and deeper into a Middle Eastern quagmire. Is Iraq our generation's \"Bright Shining Lie,\" or is it the frontline in a global battle for national survival? Or is to some combination of both?","popularity":0.0605,"poster_path":"/xkIhbrab0Qt9va7vh8LtTB5DwvI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guerrilla News Network","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BattleGround: 21 Days on the Empire's Edge","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210460,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeff Hull","original_name":"Jeff Hull","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/hG2tT6WRAoxMMCfcF7lzsJO3RE.jpg","credit_id":"67a965906ca81546040f6eee","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0426409","wikidata_id":"Q4869957","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xkIhbrab0Qt9va7vh8LtTB5DwvI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
