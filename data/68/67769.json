Very bad. Unless the others, the “normal” people – with their career plans, their adulteries, their arrogant incompetence – have fallen into a sort of collective madness. Who knows. Because he has no choice, because he is in love with his wife and because he refuses to resign himself to the worst, Samuel Polaris decides to regain his dignity. Even if, to do this, he has to steal from his psychiatrist the watch that Kennedy was wearing the day he was assassinated.","popularity":0.6441,"poster_path":"/8vAW72fQ5vzAHf0mj3jaoBNzQgY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63893,"logo_path":null,"name":"Téléma","origin_country":""},{"id":67544,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cofimage
