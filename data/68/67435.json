However, the airport is actually the ante-room of Death, and the family member is a recently deceased American survivor of the Holocaust.

Holocaust and flee Germany.","popularity":0.2479,"poster_path":"/lIpYeWGSulJO8dRRH37NaNH2zqr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1987-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falsch","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","title":"False","type":"literal
