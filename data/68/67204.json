Soon after, small-time investigative journalist Eve Pretson crawls from the wreckage of a burnt out car nearby. She suffers a complete loss of memory - with no recollection of who she is or anything that preceded the accident. Weak and disorientated, she stops at a gas station for help, but instead witnesses the murder of a local mechanic. How are these events connected? In a desperate search for answers, Eve pieces together the scattered fragments of her life, becoming ever more fearful of all she uncovers.","popularity":1.2526,"poster_path":"/aOn0oP6cqx1ZgzT9MPF8jJeEeQw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13404,"logo_path":"/4F5RxvJgbVT0vFQHs3IYRPfJvo3.png","name":"Incendo
