The live show was recorded at the end of the Post tour on February 27, 1997, at a special fan-club only free concert at the Shepherds Bush Empire in London, England. The majority of the songs are taken from the album Post, as well as some from her first album Debut. The track \"I Go Humble\" is a B-side, and appears on the \"Isobel\" single. Many of the performances from this concert can be found on the Post Live album, released as part of the Live Box in 2003 and later made available separately. The song that appears over the end credits is \"Glóra\", a flute instrumental recorded when Björk was in The Elgar Sisters. Two track that were performed on the night are omitted from this DVD - \"It's Oh So Quiet\" and \"Big Time Sensuality\" (these were performed after the last track included here).","popularity":0.4152,"poster_path":"/mTup7ueSesw7KrWquqlSKU6xC3g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Björk: Shepherd's Bush Empire 1997","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Björk","original_name":"Björk","popularity":0.571,"profile_path":"/Ahc3TWomYakLcbqZRVBDdf3rhMR.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5411db6fc3a3680207001508","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5356723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trevor Morais","original_name":"Trevor Morais","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Drums, Percussion","credit_id":"67f4b6ec8cfccf7bafd94755","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5356724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leila Arab","original_name":"Leila Arab","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Electronics (Live Mixing)","credit_id":"67f4b70b8cfccf7bafd94762","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132447,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"coba","original_name":"coba","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Accordion","credit_id":"67f4b76addf9194387d9c665","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347938,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guy Sigsworth","original_name":"Guy Sigsworth","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Keyboards, Harpsichord","credit_id":"67f4b7841bb0472899998fb6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2332839,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ed Handley","original_name":"Ed Handley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Keyboards","credit_id":"67f4b795a5471a51ee998372","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5356725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Turner","original_name":"Andy Turner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Keyboards","credit_id":"67f4b7baddf9194387d9c68a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":84551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Barnard","original_name":"David Barnard","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570c5543c3a3684c01000885","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ukFHFnwJlmb5E55yKFgdIYuja7i.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sw1I3KyF2jYpAfabc6G63GJzGs5.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eV3zUZLfeKCt5v1AZaEau1elYFs.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Aj1UrqptpNWfKXOXXlLCv4y7yZY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mTup7ueSesw7KrWquqlSKU6xC3g.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.564,"height":887,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4LG5qCrJp6qmWgkYToWhDxmHS27.jpg","vote_average":1.222,"vote_count":3,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Björk - Human Behaviour (Live at Shepherds Bush Empire)","key":"dtnsvkWjZhw","published_at":"2011-03-06T10:09:17.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"557b1fd19251413a34000034"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bjork Army Of Me Shepherds Bush Empire Live","key":"McskhuKjzXU","published_at":"2007-08-23T10:34:40.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"557b200fc3a3682616000040"}]}}}
