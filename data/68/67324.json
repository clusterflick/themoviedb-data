The result is \"Handle With Care.\" He liked the process so much that the five of them, plus Jim Keltner, spend a week in May at Dave Stewart's house, where they write and record a song a day to produce an album. We watch the creative process: group efforts (\"Dirty World\" is a found poem) and individual ones (Dylan's lyrics for \"Congratulations'). Petty calls them \"a bunch of friends who happened to be really good at making music.\" The album, released in October, goes platinum. The rock video for \"End of the Line\" is a eulogy for Orbison (1936-1988).","popularity":0.9647,"poster_path":"/sCe69177yZx0WtFBkz99Wwii6FZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The True History Of The Traveling Wilburys","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Dylan","original_name":"Bob Dylan","popularity":0.6247,"profile_path":"/pMGkRge9jE0TRgENbUYt3N5qDPl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4761c3a368484e0c3d97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Harrison","original_name":"George Harrison","popularity":0.9156,"profile_path":"/zwUO2gnKBnSrKOB9hnhI9GdOX6e.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4761c3a368484e0c3d9b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Keltner","original_name":"Jim Keltner","popularity":0.0731,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4761c3a368484e0c3d9f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Lynne","original_name":"Jeff Lynne","popularity":0.1281,"profile_path":"/aajeKKMMN0XgKb2jL90Wu7eQsR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4761c3a368484e0c3da3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Orbison","original_name":"Roy Orbison","popularity":0.2798,"profile_path":"/15zBIv3qhHj5vXwWOFl4ZfDb2bO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4761c3a368484e0c3da7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Petty","original_name":"Tom Petty","popularity":0.4062,"profile_path":"/iYZ34EdhyaVbGyBagXyQ2v1YLrG.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4761c3a368484e0c3dab","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1129097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willy Smax","original_name":"Willy Smax","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/tWDOurOtvgES1GCu182Zf1x58GM.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4761c3a368484e0c3d93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":229120,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olivia Harrison","original_name":"Olivia Harrison","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/pONsm0kY8H8OU036UnNWsmsvuKn.jpg","credit_id":"601343fa0e597b00403aca05","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1129097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willy Smax","original_name":"Willy Smax","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/tWDOurOtvgES1GCu182Zf1x58GM.jpg","credit_id":"60134401ea84c7003bbdbb40","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":203520,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Kew","original_name":"David Kew","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6013440eccde04004129cd83","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1059838","wikidata_id":"Q116051368","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uaupouunYJc93fQNMBvhMHr3T8l.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sCe69177yZx0WtFBkz99Wwii6FZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
