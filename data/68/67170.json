Unfortunately a melomanic apis melifera (Latin for honeybee) is as avid to listen on the same radio to a mellifluous symphony and play the director theatrically, waving a match as baton, instead of fertilizing his garden flowers. Donald first just turns the switch, then hides it, but the bee dials inside, so he tries to chase it, but is scared by the sting. The battle for channel choice gets worse, and vindictive.","popularity":0.4464,"poster_path":"/iVceVx3CkMhWCGeUi9g6lHgc0HI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slide Donald Slide","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Baseballfan","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Musica e Baseball","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Nash","original_name":"Clarence Nash","popularity":0.467,"profile_path":"/x2g2hbu4RRIcn6Q5RT8gpWR1FKV.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Donald Duck","credit_id":"52fe475bc3a368484e0c277d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148182,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Thelma Witmer","original_name":"Thelma Witmer","popularity":0.0576,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe475bc3a368484e0c2779","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64868,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliver Wallace","original_name":"Oliver Wallace","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c2755","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yale Gracey","original_name":"Yale Gracey","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c2761","department":"Directing","job":"Layout"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148174,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bill Justice","original_name":"Bill Justice","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe475bc3a368484e0c276d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148176,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bob Carlson","original_name":"Bob Carlson","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c275b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148175,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Volus Jones","original_name":"Volus Jones","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c2767","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Hannah","original_name":"Jack Hannah","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/kWFFTlq7VEjbRho2pWLT2zAD05Q.jpg","credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c273d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148223,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Judge Whitaker","original_name":"Judge Whitaker","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/zvjD5NEDAJkGkKTCKbaUZH4TuR1.jpg","credit_id":"52fe475bc3a368484e0c2773","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148075,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nick George","original_name":"Nick George","popularity":0.1526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c2743","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148073,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bill Berg","original_name":"Bill Berg","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c2749","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c274f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0041884","wikidata_id":"Q3486657","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1632,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lyxs18VTJnN0OhlG3m8eMwYsKPq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2901}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.655,"height":886,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iVceVx3CkMhWCGeUi9g6lHgc0HI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iaAuekVakx1fKbxuDB2NxavtnKl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/kUsvBSeecYWRNUWN1wT7VpRvNSk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1949-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
