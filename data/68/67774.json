While Gógó is continuously getting herself into trouble, of the kind only a person with Alzheimer can, the son, the director, is struggling with financial troubles after his film Children of Nature has flopped in the cinema. As Gógó‘s disease progresses her family decides that it is best for her to move to a nursing home. Gógó and her deceased husband, who appears on the scene, are not happy with that decision. The director is dependent on others when it comes to his finances and when Gógó settles into the nursing home he decides to sell his mother’s apartment and valuable artwork but the profits of the sale help him to get by.","popularity":0.3482,"poster_path":"/8GuBoj9hKEoQ8yTWo8QbeaGR5Nf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129992,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spellbound Productions","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":10971,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmhuset Produksjoner","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":254,"logo_path":"/ijBPMFIV5nWzjVupZWIlt4Limlf.png","name":"Pandora Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":94167,"logo_path":"/y0lYIFz0Oxerx6JKCVyoI0BMeyL.png","name":"Berserk Films","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mamma Gógó","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Mama Gógó","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristbjörg Kjeld","original_name":"Kristbjörg Kjeld","popularity":0.2867,"profile_path":"/6pLWMsIbWFaicJcAYjXZnspLaf9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mamma Gógó","credit_id":"60a7b14b501cf200592fb2d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilmir Snær Guðnason","original_name":"Hilmir Snær Guðnason","popularity":0.2199,"profile_path":"/iq5hffgLNz7JEqqUIWdNCV3aegx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The director","credit_id":"60a7b18985702e00291745ef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gunnar Eyjólfsson","original_name":"Gunnar Eyjólfsson","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":"/3IQPa4auIx16f3zorcCk21v7gs6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gógó's deceased husband","credit_id":"60a7b1a47dfda6002a767a45","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":110899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margrét Vilhjálmsdóttir","original_name":"Margrét Vilhjálmsdóttir","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/cIpREE0JnW3jHwaq5Sz4TrbdYcY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The director's wife","credit_id":"60a7b1d0501cf20078c48282","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ólafía Hrönn Jónsdóttir","original_name":"Ólafía Hrönn Jónsdóttir","popularity":0.1266,"profile_path":"/AtRerfpZlUy3P80vIfpjmcmkYeH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The director's Sister 1","credit_id":"60a7b1e685702e0029174669","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1611090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inga Maria Valdimarsdóttir","original_name":"Inga Maria Valdimarsdóttir","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The director's sister 2","credit_id":"60a7b1f0fac50200418f79db","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jóhann Sigurðarson","original_name":"Jóhann Sigurðarson","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/yLpvfUkienQaNzbtfj2HUpUHrYj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Bank Manager","credit_id":"60a7b1fce16e5a003f88ac70","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1011837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bjarni Ingvarsson","original_name":"Bjarni Ingvarsson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The Farmer","credit_id":"60a7b20585702e00580a5550","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","original_name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/iBTUqqjVDSio6ROLBPfkucOpEkD.jpg","credit_id":"60a7b21a142ef1002785c125","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1634,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anders Refn","original_name":"Anders Refn","popularity":0.1119,"profile_path":"/jjjGZVnJqAIYKn61APLJtqgyJwA.jpg","credit_id":"60a7b2be4b0c6300579812c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935603,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sigvaldi J.
