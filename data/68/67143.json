This boat is a bit unusual: to rent it, you put a nickel in a slot, and the mast and sail pop up. Unfortunately, after a while, they pop back down. When Donald runs out of nickels, they are marooned. Goofy waves his shirt at a passing cruise ship, but they (and he) mistake this for a friendly greeting. A flying fish lands in the boat; while the boys fight over it, a gull grabs it. They try to bash the gull, which lands atop their heads, with predictable results. Finally, as the sharks circle, they try fishing, with Donald as the unwitting bait. He eventually lands back in the boat, where his bill lands in the coin slot and gives them a way home.","popularity":0.6039,"poster_path":"/g7m4lj89JDsdwlvvShz9AotdWRr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Sail","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":27,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Marineros en apuros","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"In Seenot","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Una gita in barca","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Sejlturen","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Disneyn riemuralli","type":"Video box title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Nash","original_name":"Clarence Nash","popularity":0.467,"profile_path":"/x2g2hbu4RRIcn6Q5RT8gpWR1FKV.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Donald Duck (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4758c3a368484e0c2197","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinto Colvig","original_name":"Pinto Colvig","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/jslBLHuV1cOKsyx763CA1RqsrQU.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Goofy (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4759c3a368484e0c219b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4758c3a368484e0c2157","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Hannah","original_name":"Jack Hannah","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/kWFFTlq7VEjbRho2pWLT2zAD05Q.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4758c3a368484e0c215d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115757,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dick Kinney","original_name":"Dick Kinney","popularity":0.1633,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4758c3a368484e0c2163","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148822,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ralph Wright","original_name":"Ralph Wright","popularity":0.3049,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4758c3a368484e0c2169","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64868,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliver Wallace","original_name":"Oliver Wallace","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4758c3a368484e0c216f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148176,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bob Carlson","original_name":"Bob Carlson","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4758c3a368484e0c2175","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224698,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Hugh Fraser","original_name":"Hugh Fraser","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4758c3a368484e0c217b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":572069,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"John F.
