But for non-professionals with jobs, families and other commitments, the journey just to get to the starting line can be even more challenging. Documenting the nine months leading up to raceday, \"The Distance: A Triathlete's Journey\" examines the enormous impact that training for the race has on the lives of three very different amateurs preparing for their first attempt at the ultimate endurance event. There's the mother of triplets who struggles to find the balance between training and family demands. The newlywed who learns his first child is due just two weeks before raceday. And the student, who tries to stay committed to his goal despite the ever-present temptations of college life.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":176,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Before you make it to the finish, you have to make it to the start.","title":"The Distance: A Triathlete's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":548620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Jesse","original_name":"Dave Jesse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4762c3a368484e0c4161","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":548621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tammy Wuebben","original_name":"Tammy Wuebben","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4762c3a368484e0c4165","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":548622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Cowdy","original_name":"Josh Cowdy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4762c3a368484e0c4169","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Distance: A Triathlete's Journey Movie Trailer","key":"IS7zBPtXxGU","published_at":"2009-03-20T01:45:46.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6bdc3a36854480068b3"}]}}}
