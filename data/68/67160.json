At first Pluto thinks it really is utopia: trees everywhere and a cat to chase. But the cabin rules are strict: no dogs indoors, and dogs must be muzzled and leashed. Mickey puts Pluto out to sleep, just out of reach of his food, and the cat comes down and taunts him. Pluto falls asleep and dreams of his \"Plutopia\" with a subservient cat begging Pluto to bite him and catering to his every need.","popularity":0.5304,"poster_path":"/6z7V27MYsaoXrzwYKcrf9zY2h0q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney
