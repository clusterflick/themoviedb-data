Everyone loves her, and some (like the drunkard neighbor, for example) are even afraid of her. But Nadya has not yet met her fate. She lives with her beloved grandmother and loves to fish: every weekend she goes overnight to the river in her Zhiguli. And then on one of these weekends, Nadya meets the “prince on a white horse.” This is Victor, a businessman from Moscow, a horse riding enthusiast. The acquaintance began romantically and continued like in a fairy tale. Soon the wedding was scheduled.","popularity":0.2805,"poster_path":"/9wx8p6mnlCtdr6OiGDtrt3SKpL3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Met Strangely","video":false,"vote_average":9.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"My Stranno Vstretilis","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Krasko","original_name":"Ольга Красько","popularity":0.2308,"profile_path":"/xT73y0lDQqWNHjxUwAfu36t9hG2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe477bc3a368484e0c9633","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yaroslav Boyko","original_name":"Ярослав Бойко","popularity":0.3929,"profile_path":"/vmGbGhgF4nY1gea5Ayd5CfnBfkf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe477bc3a368484e0c9637","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Yushkevich","original_name":"Сергей Юшкевич","popularity":0.2142,"profile_path":"/z6Xoee7HaslFhDrNcgdakC0PHCs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe477bc3a368484e0c963b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2037030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatyana Kuznetsova","original_name":"Татьяна Кузнецова","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":"/zn4RXEIvlmNkOu9y3ElqDXLI9Wm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65fe90fa197de40186183cf2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saido Kurbanov","original_name":"Сайдо Курбанов","popularity":0.0611,"profile_path":"/mVFE09ydrDbWQPOPfopOCyyCRCb.jpg","credit_id":"52fe477bc3a368484e0c962f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1602665,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aleksey Naydenov","original_name":"Aleksey Naydenov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/isUNoboWLs4Y1ynKzEWBCR17IGj.jpg","credit_id":"679e6bc0b06437a4ee263310","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3514740","wikidata_id":"Q16706937","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":849,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9wx8p6mnlCtdr6OiGDtrt3SKpL3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
