The child's mother explains that they have no money, and so she cannot buy any oranges. The dog is then packed up along with a box full of other toys to be sold, but it soon winds up in the street. The dog picks up an orange from a curb side stand, and hopes to take it home to the child. But that night, before the dog can get back to the child's home, it must face a series of strange and frightening adventures.","popularity":0.2546,"poster_path":"/ntOnxz6FNfLrE74NbYNasM3mNgz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70303,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gelma-Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1933-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mascot","video":false,"vote_average":7.027,"vote_count":37,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Devil's Ball","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Fétiche mascotte","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"A báb","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Stuffy's Errand of Mercy","type":"short version"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Władysław Starewicz","original_name":"Wladyslaw Starewicz","popularity":0.1865,"profile_path":"/dOnxDnOYDL7brv0nxspT8Zth8bu.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4770c3a368484e0c6f2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551067,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edouard Flament","original_name":"Edouard Flament","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56755aee92514179d4002a03","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938147,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Irene Starewicz","original_name":"Irene Starewicz","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":"/pMOoRA2naXlLdZqchrCO0wYtpAy.jpg","credit_id":"645028d8ee43e800e3c944f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0025477","wikidata_id":"Q19544617","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/86orLPAuiLKG558chPsLNmvt5to.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1776},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":983,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xofOrJpuuZ5HAiUV7asbkiXph8D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1748},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":839,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5UobGqdn4ETxSTIbsWSFTLpBK3L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1492},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w9Fa1AqXitxbzUUqi8MQ27cTEUu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":838,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/74Iwu799u6Em8zMvulLYxsspbDg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1490},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":852,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lKyFpHJGH6ufTOtpVxHW9hM6QWy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1515},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":953,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8odgNEozC2BPqdLLmgoq0H4Wj72.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1694}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1613,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ntOnxz6FNfLrE74NbYNasM3mNgz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1076},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1607,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/b0aUZNatDLUhfXaSWZoqyoRsLyZ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1071},{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":2397,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/zEKmwKwipaVgnRlb7COJ12sJYA0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1668},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9kWw47a8IFXQJS21DTJoVJKCKd8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":290380,"name":"puppet animation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1933-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
