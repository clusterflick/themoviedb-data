It offers to do Mickey's bidding. Mickey's first wish is for a doghouse, and the lamp starts to work. Suddenly, the saw, the planer, the paintbrush and other tools magically begin working on their own. Finally, Pluto has a magnificent doghouse. The second wish? Mickey asks the lamp to give Pluto a bath. But things go awry when Pluto accidentally breaks Mickey's radio. Now, all sorts of conflicting messages are coming out of the speaker as Mickey tries to fix it. The lamp assumes all the voices are Mickey's and obeys them. Pluto is rolled with a rolling pin, punched with boxing gloves, frozen in an aspic and is about to be cut into thin slices before all ends happily.","popularity":1.0307,"poster_path":"/c6xNa8o3PIehG2rRLN0lIqtANoU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pluto's Dream House","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":29,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La casa de los sueños de Pluto","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"La casa dei sogni di Pluto","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Plutos drömhus","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mickey Mouse (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c24a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Millar","original_name":"Lee Millar","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Pluto (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c24a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Bletcher","original_name":"Billy Bletcher","popularity":0.4537,"profile_path":"/ncapDtCeDsMJxEKFXocJTFfnpau.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Magic Lamp (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c24ab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elvia Allman","original_name":"Elvia Allman","popularity":0.2032,"profile_path":"/r8MDamNJNwi83TXXn4lt41PtmTD.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cooking Show Lady on Radio (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c24af","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64864,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Clyde Geronimi","original_name":"Clyde Geronimi","popularity":0.5443,"profile_path":"/eAeqN6fPYuzKjGRSaR2jqhSeeMq.jpg","credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c2493","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c2499","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5467,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leigh Harline","original_name":"Leigh Harline","popularity":0.2007,"profile_path":"/g72SQBnwJmOnuwO6LvVbd8RzE7A.jpg","credit_id":"52fe475ac3a368484e0c249f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0032918","wikidata_id":"Q3226807","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3oWOIf0xIhOtHHUUSt1VNfQPdff.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c6xNa8o3PIehG2rRLN0lIqtANoU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.651,"height":1537,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/z9WPuYc9DrOJN9YAGRjKOlf6iyq.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/DhP57KXdYHgchIL4QUnp3aRb3U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xh6dbuULSmnfgK26uFFAEE1iPiD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b5hFeCwsi1NTlezw8f5MOSeUDLR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9MI52A2dJXghd4YhHFr0SOP3nwY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6513,"name":"cartoon"},{"id":2135,"name":"radio"},{"id":239734,"name":"magic lamp"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1940-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
