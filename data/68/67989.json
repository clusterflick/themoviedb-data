By following the lives of leopard mothers and their cubs in East Africa the film investigates what it is about the natural history of these cats that makes them born survivors. Perhaps the most extraordinary revelation is that leopards are living undercover on farms and even in cities across Africa and Asia.","popularity":0.9899,"poster_path":"/3i5gXLWdYtKfWa1C0lj28PBNilE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144640,"logo_path":"/6kl5tMuct7u3ej5myL4c9QQVSW1.png","name":"BBC Two","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":10492,"logo_path":"/3fcHNVpW66wgG6o0cgFJlcP8cCg.png","name":"Thirteen","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Secret Leopards","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1347573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Scott","original_name":"Jonathan Scott","popularity":0.151,"profile_path":"/92GjrlBLTNRazbaLZUYHTQznkOu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"65e15a67a284eb0164d47fc5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346412,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Fletcher","original_name":"Mark Fletcher","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/AdMdRzj4kMKTLlJoVHk06tj9e1H.jpg","credit_id":"65e15a296a300b01641e07b8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":63729,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jennie Muskett","original_name":"Jennie Muskett","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/cW05GNVH0CXwsn9PWyOT1BBmsZK.jpg","credit_id":"65e15a88a806730161a8ff84","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346803,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Owen Newman","original_name":"Owen Newman","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e15ae96c449c0186f9fd93","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579622,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Warren Samuels","original_name":"Warren Samuels","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/dgo1UEC550oD1wCkNhSK5Iur7KD.jpg","credit_id":"65e15b01f85958018650858f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2169712","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3i5gXLWdYtKfWa1C0lj28PBNilE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4478,"name":"leopard"},{"id":251493,"name":"big cats"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Natural World","release_date":"2010-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
