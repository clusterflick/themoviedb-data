D-Day tells the epic story of the preparation and execution of the Allied invasion of Normandy. It tells the story of the defence of the Western Front by the forces of the German Empire, and of the complex and deadly secret war fought by the men and women of France and mainland Europe. D-Day brings to life the dramatic and astounding tales of courage and sacrifice, joy and despair, love and betrayal. The planning for the Allied invasion on June 6th 1944 took two years and cost thousands of lives. It involved a deception of breathtaking audacity. Both the preparation leading up to and the actions and events on the day itself relied on the absolute discretion of many and the genius and nerve of a few. D-Day examines the intricate jigsaw from both sides - presenting events through the eyes of the men and women who were there, telling their extraordinary stories.","popularity":1.6439,"poster_path":"/jXk7gWMqaTgA3tYxICSZMHVbt8Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"D-Day 6.6.1944","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":25,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"D-Day","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Holm","original_name":"Ian Holm","popularity":1.4643,"profile_path":"/9YbuYOqOmYwReBAj9Hh6z7DWwhH.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"570c12759251413c85000aa1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1280687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lacy Moore","original_name":"Lacy Moore","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/cuwdPXVQ5kmXn1A9kbMXqyqwTDE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kay Summersby","credit_id":"570c12c3c3a36802a3000ae8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham McTavish","original_name":"Graham McTavish","popularity":0.7942,"profile_path":"/9IjPwv7Vb4QygA1cPSX179oqjsT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Group Capt.
