He spritzes them with insecticide, but runs out and they keep feasting. He mixes a new batch. Meanwhile, Pluto stalks a bug and gets his head stick in a pumpkin. He stumbles around and bumps into Mickey and the sprayer, giving Mickey a faceful of bug juice. He awakens to a warped reality, where the bugs and plants are giant sized, and the bugs get drunk on the insecticide and chase our heroes. Mickey recovers from his nightmare, discovering the giant worm he was wrestling was the hose.","popularity":0.8931,"poster_path":"/1i00MhDbLJ4LHfBz6mX6QSSeHTU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mickey's Garden","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":42,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El jardín de Mickey","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"MIckey Mouse (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"55395f189251413f5a002749","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinto Colvig","original_name":"Pinto Colvig","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/jslBLHuV1cOKsyx763CA1RqsrQU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pluto (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"55395f28c3a3685f9b002a28","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"55395f77c3a3685cf8001f56","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143786,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ollie Johnston","original_name":"Ollie Johnston","popularity":0.2269,"profile_path":"/7LShcoYbJg7vfXV2lSjzTlGAGb.jpg","credit_id":"55395fcdc3a3684c5b003844","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wilfred Jackson","original_name":"Wilfred Jackson","popularity":0.3723,"profile_path":"/rTszyDc1jFOQQrzSYgnxEVLxd8W.jpg","credit_id":"55395efac3a36878450071d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69134,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dick Huemer","original_name":"Dick Huemer","popularity":0.9834,"profile_path":"/eJwIebTnY1xGhlQV1p0AvnpGFFQ.jpg","credit_id":"55395fa5925141275e001df6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5692,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Art Babbitt","original_name":"Art Babbitt","popularity":0.167,"profile_path":"/1BVYJHapPlRWrjo9dxjTHV5UxYc.jpg","credit_id":"55395f9092514138a9003085","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225709,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Frenchy de Trémaudan","original_name":"Frenchy de Trémaudan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559465579251416386002414","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5467,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leigh Harline","original_name":"Leigh Harline","popularity":0.2007,"profile_path":"/g72SQBnwJmOnuwO6LvVbd8RzE7A.jpg","credit_id":"571d8e76c3a3683603001423","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0026707","wikidata_id":"Q3223551","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rE8aSXTbgSF0tbOB8GAlWUfmimf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1i00MhDbLJ4LHfBz6mX6QSSeHTU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tgSVfruLWdXYL9oxdRzyhpPQ5CZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/w1yAtjnMGQGgw4MeNkM3sRdaecW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2746,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eeBFCa0tDYe2X1WD1B7Z6MQmY35.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3030,"name":"nightmare"},{"id":6513,"name":"cartoon"},{"id":166471,"name":"gardening"},{"id":208736,"name":"bugs"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
