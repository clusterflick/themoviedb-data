However, his trip never quite gets off the ground mainly because he spends most of it stuck behind a slow moving trailer. When he gets a flat tire, the mechanic inspects every part of his car except the tire. The only motel he can find is a little shack too close to a railroad track. On the road once more, he gets stuck behind said trailer again only to pass it and discover no one is driving it.","popularity":0.4154,"poster_path":"/4Jbdff3bzb89m4nQLlfPywgiZDv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Weeks Vacation","video":false,"vote_average":6.788,"vote_count":26,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Una Bella Vacanza","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Dos semanas de vacaciones","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinto Colvig","original_name":"Pinto Colvig","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/jslBLHuV1cOKsyx763CA1RqsrQU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Goofy (voice)","credit_id":"5f25febd8d1b8e00356b05c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Reed","original_name":"Alan Reed","popularity":0.4589,"profile_path":"/ilsEwVPUTQ6f9qSdRtraGhZ5BG6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator / Mechanic / Hitch-Hiker (voice)","credit_id":"5f25fedd8d1b8e00366ac246","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Kinney","original_name":"Jack Kinney","popularity":0.3626,"profile_path":"/4wFzg3PdcrB1wPnCl5sj4KuS2Mk.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4772c3a368484e0c77df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150036,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Al Bertino","original_name":"Al Bertino","popularity":0.109,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f25fe920231f200361b9a6a","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"5f25fe9dd940350036563f6f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0045271","wikidata_id":"Q3028329","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u57iKmhbMhM2Hh4pHLOPzRlRv9e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":878,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4Jbdff3bzb89m4nQLlfPywgiZDv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mPlm3Rvpy1NMztYtMWBMdTKk3qE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ztaOpPa3aEm8nfOKfPqS9sU8ffv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/r9vnINnzxkcNPyZaRH9kDMTKfoE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"Btl","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1953-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
