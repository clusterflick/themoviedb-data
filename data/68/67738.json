Kindness is noticeably absent among their quarters, as demonstrated by a dating pair of neighbors whose request to have their apartments connected was flatly denied. To make matters worse, beggars gathering at a charity event are cruelly tormented by various tenants during the Christmas season. Last but not least is the Portuguese concierge whose services are in danger of being replaced by a more cost-effective alternative, and a widow whose recent loss earns her no sympathy from the rent-demanding landlords.","popularity":0.3936,"poster_path":"/7ZzUqS6tgaC2B8XWPKbDIwhuLPX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5281,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cofimage 12","origin_country":""},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2002-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Landlords","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Mille millièmes, fantaisie immobilière","type":"long"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grégori Derangère","original_name":"Grégori Derangère","popularity":0.1743,"profile_path":"/hGil5CTnudDlDaCdvIWfGT7jsdG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Vincent","credit_id":"52fe4774c3a368484e0c7e85","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irène Jacob","original_name":"Irène Jacob","popularity":1.0465,"profile_path":"/yDpLjFtglSDlq3pvITr7O5AQfvg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"52fe4774c3a368484e0c7e89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Darroussin","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Darroussin","popularity":0.4378,"profile_path":"/bFIJ3bdn5bjx3r5Tm4VPjlaxwfr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Patrick Bertil","credit_id":"52fe4774c3a368484e0c7e8d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Chesnais","original_name":"Patrick Chesnais","popularity":0.27,"profile_path":"/g0eY9xGHUCIZBJj0QfxNnZQcH98.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gérard","credit_id":"52fe4774c3a368484e0c7e91","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Canet","original_name":"Guillaume Canet","popularity":1.448,"profile_path":"/yxerAhXValEezb1EuV9XWc9L8KC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Josselin","credit_id":"52fe4774c3a368484e0c7e95","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Delpy","original_name":"Albert Delpy","popularity":0.1923,"profile_path":"/8j9s2hCN0IEdr7QCeHoxo5cbHTf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"M.
