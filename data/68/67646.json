Perhaps he wants the isolation he might find there. His solitude destroyed by a bevy of friends, some housepainters hired by his girlfriend, and his family, our philosophical hero makes his way to a nondescript hotel room in Venice, where he spends his time playing darts in his room. When his girlfriend visits him there, he responds to this interruption of his musings by briefly using her forehead as a dartboard. Eventually he returns to his Paris apartment, and reconciles with his injured girlfriend.","popularity":0.1028,"poster_path":"/9f4uBIFPAXQqtCXNtcv1jBqBRFe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1989-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bathroom","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"På badet","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Novembre","original_name":"Tom Novembre","popularity":0.1587,"profile_path":"/YHLQQ5Z4PSsj1PoXWb7Jr6xmiO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Main Character","credit_id":"52fe4770c3a368484e0c6de3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":185422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gunilla Karlzen","original_name":"Gunilla Karlzen","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Edmondsson","credit_id":"52fe4770c3a368484e0c6de7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Lvoff","original_name":"John Lvoff","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4770c3a368484e0c6ddf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0098245","wikidata_id":"Q3212701","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9f4uBIFPAXQqtCXNtcv1jBqBRFe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
