Achille Pinglard (Jean-Luc Bideau) is a factory foreman and his wife Ginette (Michele Brousse) works in a porno theater. Together, they are driving their daughter up the wall. She vents her feelings in her private diary, which her parents often expropriate for their own use. Meanwhile, the son in the family finds himself without a room after his parents rent it out to someone else, and the grandmother is a demented alcoholic invalid.","popularity":0.1894,"poster_path":"/jIh8kH1o34g2b4gd0hpCDjt7Nfa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1986-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le bonheur a encore frappé","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Luc Bideau","original_name":"Jean-Luc Bideau","popularity":0.3166,"profile_path":"/oyHa0DPwYztBe2k6LlGY9tu4jE.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Achille Pinglard","credit_id":"52fe46bac3a368484e0a08d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Brousse","original_name":"Michèle Brousse","popularity":0.1185,"profile_path":"/k7pBakL2MGggSd7eQn15MYXyuL2.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Ginette Pinglard","credit_id":"52fe46bac3a368484e0a08d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Noël Brouté","original_name":"Jean-Noël Brouté","popularity":0.2337,"profile_path":"/yNPik9dLaMkrNmBKISLGY9BEAxM.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Adolf Pinglard","credit_id":"52fe46bac3a368484e0a08dd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":237872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Appere","original_name":"Caroline Appere","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Josette Pinglard","credit_id":"52fe46bac3a368484e0a08e1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":237870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Luc Trotignon","original_name":"Jean-Luc Trotignon","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46bac3a368484e0a08d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0090762","wikidata_id":"Q14901496","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aX2ks0yadekHr60IIgyLhL7Nc6p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4soWjUAh0tbKdEnDZssFSZZBxvn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3MijUEhR8XCaK5srChanm3BAz6O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3sPxM8rMmMj50ufR4kHvdy1bymU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3yjx1ReVnvQQGh3WjcK7XQ3BMBk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/jIh8kH1o34g2b4gd0hpCDjt7Nfa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
