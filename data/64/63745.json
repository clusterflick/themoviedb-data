The links in this chain begin with Christian and Nathalie, who are coworkers and friends. Christian discovers that his lover Francoise is having an affair, and Nathalie advises him to give his feelings some time to heal, about two years. Nathalie is angry that her lover Mark does not want to see her more often, while he is jealous of the men in her past. Meanwhile, Francoise finds out that her new lover is not that interested in her anymore, and after they split, she encounters him with someone else. As romance fluctuates like the lunar tides, the myth of one true love takes a beating.","popularity":0.2843,"poster_path":"/j3OgUIFm52GnRULRs3dtZkDmZoT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Qui trop embrasse...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Wiazemsky","original_name":"Anne Wiazemsky","popularity":0.1171,"profile_path":"/1YF6xvQQXHgED5vJKSFKTTis7Y6.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Nathalie","credit_id":"52fe46b9c3a368484e0a0605","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrzej Seweryn","original_name":"Andrzej Seweryn","popularity":0.4747,"profile_path":"/uYohJvqAai28Piqa0eEs6zAeFer.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Marc","credit_id":"52fe46b9c3a368484e0a0609","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tonie Marshall","original_name":"Tonie Marshall","popularity":0.1869,"profile_path":"/urtlFI9YSRQKytvYeFXxCo9Ep55.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Françoise","credit_id":"52fe46b9c3a368484e0a060d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":237847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Gautier","original_name":"Michel Gautier","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Christian","credit_id":"52fe46b9c3a368484e0a0611","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":586298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Wauthion","original_name":"Claire Wauthion","popularity":0.2044,"profile_path":"/hIutJDXsIOnGpuzIT5ONmcuTMGm.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"La dame à l'enfant","credit_id":"60f1960b097c490046574f0d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micheline Presle","original_name":"Micheline Presle","popularity":0.2774,"profile_path":"/l3JEGPsntAwicRgZaNelmVoYGmg.jpg","cast_id":1011,"character":"La mère de Christian","credit_id":"60f19612bccf1e004690b02e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Cloarec","original_name":"Christian Cloarec","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1012,"character":"Jean-François","credit_id":"60f1961b71ffdf00747be112","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingrid Bourgoin","original_name":"Ingrid Bourgoin","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1013,"character":"La dame en fourrure","credit_id":"60f1962871ffdf002ad47751","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":237846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Davila","original_name":"Jacques Davila","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46b9c3a368484e0a0601","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20524,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Marie Dreujou","original_name":"Jean-Marie Dreujou","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/oFyorThxgJBXRhlvxtQPN0BspFO.jpg","credit_id":"62e023a75aba32005d1d0463","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":237846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Davila","original_name":"Jacques Davila","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae098c10e0a2615690173bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Vecchiali","original_name":"Paul Vecchiali","popularity":0.1797,"profile_path":"/asmAmxUh09s7mNbFXWuAaEossPX.jpg","credit_id":"5ae099050e0a26155d01640a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35073,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Coulais","original_name":"Bruno Coulais","popularity":0.1494,"profile_path":"/dhmDPpo6GZ747T2tI7DmYnDEGA8.jpg","credit_id":"5ae098e90e0a261569017404","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":237847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Gautier","original_name":"Michel Gautier","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae098d10e0a261566013d5a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0091813","wikidata_id":"Q21009318","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j3OgUIFm52GnRULRs3dtZkDmZoT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
