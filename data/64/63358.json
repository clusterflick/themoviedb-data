In 1942 she was living under an assumed name in Munich and married to Werner Vetter, a Nazi party member who was later drafted into the Wehrmacht. Based on Hahn's acclaimed memoir, \"The Nazi Officer's Wife\" is the riveting account of how she survived the Holocaust by posing as an Aryan hausfrau. Despite the risks, she kept painstaking records including real and falsified documents and photos of labor camps. These moving artifacts along with testimony from Hahn and her daughter bring this tale of survival resilience and redemption to life.","popularity":0.7543,"poster_path":"/kkebeC5phE0a3qAOdJNApNxLkof.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How one Jewish woman survived the Holocaust","title":"The Nazi Officer's Wife","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237190,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edith Hahn Beer","original_name":"Edith Hahn Beer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe46a7c3a368484e09c6bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Ormond","original_name":"Julia Ormond","popularity":1.0403,"profile_path":"/u7Oz6nHfMSlXuT34K7Ffp4f2qgP.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Edith Hahn (voice)","credit_id":"52fe46a7c3a368484e09c6c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Sarandon","original_name":"Susan Sarandon","popularity":2.5599,"profile_path":"/oHYYL8bNakAREaLUBtMul5uMG0A.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe46a7c3a368484e09c6c7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96199,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Liz Garbus","original_name":"Liz Garbus","popularity":0.2279,"profile_path":"/8iMNA3Wqx3wbDwojoYJknXAwLk8.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46a7c3a368484e09c6cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Youngelson","original_name":"Jack Youngelson","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46a7c3a368484e09c6d3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237190,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edith Hahn Beer","original_name":"Edith Hahn Beer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42d3c94772150035612052","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0352621","wikidata_id":"Q7753324","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"mn","file_path":"/kkebeC5phE0a3qAOdJNApNxLkof.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zyfpp3i3qRHy05yz94aA5W4b1uo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
