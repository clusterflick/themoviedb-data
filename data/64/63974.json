Then their son telephones to say he will be coming over with his girlfriend and the normal pattern is changed, as he visits them rarely. While the mother is obsequious to her son when he arrives, past hurts and resentments bubble up during lunch, making it difficult for the son to tell them he is getting married. This is news enough, but the effect that announcement has on the son and his fiancée is unexpected and events later on in the day take a turn for the worse.","popularity":0.1836,"poster_path":"/1rEuyQbhueZMD3tTHDnCmJFgZX4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1986-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beau temps mais orageux en fin de journée","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xavier Deluc","original_name":"Xavier Deluc","popularity":0.1042,"profile_path":"/gzIuViUIacUQNtqTEc50ibraFtM.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Bernard","credit_id":"52fe46c4c3a368484e0a27bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tonie Marshall","original_name":"Tonie Marshall","popularity":0.1869,"profile_path":"/urtlFI9YSRQKytvYeFXxCo9Ep55.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Brigitte","credit_id":"52fe46c4c3a368484e0a27c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micheline Presle","original_name":"Micheline Presle","popularity":0.2774,"profile_path":"/l3JEGPsntAwicRgZaNelmVoYGmg.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Jacqueline","credit_id":"52fe46c4c3a368484e0a27c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Piéplu","original_name":"Claude Piéplu","popularity":0.3325,"profile_path":"/8796nDcGfUC7lJGqzjQsrhoAd0e.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Jacques","credit_id":"52fe46c4c3a368484e0a27cb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingrid Bourgoin","original_name":"Ingrid Bourgoin","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Teresa","credit_id":"58b758669251414ecd0004b9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Frot-Coutaz","original_name":"Gérard Frot-Coutaz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/vjP7tMjxCDbxRsIiqiK4tzFhQle.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46c4c3a368484e0a27bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0090706","wikidata_id":"Q2893100","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/1rEuyQbhueZMD3tTHDnCmJFgZX4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1153,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/kNZqIwhO3ZDa1WwaOwbcFVppY5i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":769}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
