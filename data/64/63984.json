With a cast made up of real-life villagers from the area where the events took place, the detailed re-enactments and careful attention to the gestures of their ancestors serve to create an intense and sometimes disturbing atmosphere of hyper-realism. Details of the crime and of the trial that followed are told from varied perspectives, including the written confession of Pierre himself, and form a rich and complex narrative that interrogates the concepts of “truth” and “history”.","popularity":0.6806,"poster_path":"/3DBitkcleNjXle93m4kKwMUBjAP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de
