Marion, 40, beautiful and famous, is the star. Gabriel, her 55-year-old husband, is less fortunate: he's the one who discovered Marion, but never managed to impose himself. That evening, throughout the performance, the couple will indulge in a savage settling of scores, while the anecdotes of the evening and the other actors provide a comical counterpoint to the monstrous confrontation.","popularity":0.3509,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Partenaires","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Garcia","original_name":"Nicole Garcia","popularity":0.5807,"profile_path":"/kZWBVMLkxGhH97DgJ0uoUlSF5Z5.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Marion Wormser","credit_id":"52fe46a0c3a368484e09af45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Marielle","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Marielle","popularity":0.4033,"profile_path":"/yrCA8WtOZUwzY5EK0kmlEpgBgid.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Gabriel Gallien","credit_id":"52fe46a0c3a368484e09af49","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Duchaussoy","original_name":"Michel Duchaussoy","popularity":0.4662,"profile_path":"/5HuD9Y3hYUKgfomk93DMRS4G4pT.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Laurent Tedesco","credit_id":"52fe46a0c3a368484e09af4d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisa Servier","original_name":"Elisa Servier","popularity":0.2152,"profile_path":"/oluStLMFiw4cE9hR19mZlJRyY6f.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Marie-Lou Pasquier","credit_id":"52fe46a0c3a368484e09af51","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Galabru","original_name":"Michel Galabru","popularity":0.3315,"profile_path":"/f6uvYIfc6cgQkn713rViFXIUCn0.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"52fe46a0c3a368484e09af55","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Clève","original_name":"Jenny Clève","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":"/kARTsNVnGqINNE6JN6WF1KmV4JI.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"","credit_id":"65e2aa6a278d8a0185bdc325","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Rignault","original_name":"Alexandre Rignault","popularity":0.2065,"profile_path":"/gzGK1SG19jNSGPfgYLsWWP4dgei.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"","credit_id":"65e2aa722e2b2c00e7b4aaca","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Montillier","original_name":"Georges Montillier","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":"/9IixhgApKdyS4EWZkXjaozzrN7C.jpg","cast_id":1011,"character":"","credit_id":"65e2aa7fc99826017b60ad7c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1152067,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean Achache","original_name":"Jean Achache","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1012,"character":"","credit_id":"65e2aa8d2ac4990186ed60a4","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude d'Anna","original_name":"Claude d'Anna","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/1ZTZbGTsVguCXjmkAcsWMPtHuEA.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46a0c3a368484e09af41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131305,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laure Bonin","original_name":"Laure Bonin","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e2aa46db72c0017cf542b8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude d'Anna","original_name":"Claude d'Anna","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/1ZTZbGTsVguCXjmkAcsWMPtHuEA.jpg","credit_id":"65e2aa509979d2017caf8d8a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0087887","wikidata_id":"Q3366093","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
