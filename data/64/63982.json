Francois (Jean Francois Stevenin, the director) and Leo (Yves Alonso) are old friends, and at one point they decide to go out and search for one of their childhood buddies, the brunt of several of their practical jokes. In true form, the men opt for playing yet another practical joke on their friend, but their plans backfire when his wife Helene (Carole Bouquet) comes into the picture instead. Her presence forces them to reconsider their shenanigans in a new light.","popularity":0.375,"poster_path":"/vLxSLZmMJA8mrsOBrwOoXCkyT48.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":591,"logo_path":"/q5I5RDwMEiqoNmfaJgd2LraEOJY.png","name":"France 3
