The documentary, directed by Lutz Becker, attempts to remain as objective as possible, serving as a neutral observer of the years 1918 through 1933 in Germany. Via newsreel footage and clips of features from the era, the film offers a kaleidoscopic view of the many elements that fueled the rise of the Socialist Nationalist Party, including post-WWI poverty. Hitler occupies a central place in the documentary.","popularity":0.6379,"poster_path":"/91btXQvMa87ons4po0pAwqybBtU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Headed Eagle: Hitler's Rise to Power 1918-1933","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Hitler","original_name":"Adolf Hitler","popularity":0.7926,"profile_path":"/n6f81IUSes1a8jTzUIF7rJ5zZnP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4698c3a368484e0995c9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Mora","original_name":"Philippe Mora","popularity":0.2185,"profile_path":"/aT8heTidkrxWn2Vl3SsGi89RsLe.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4698c3a368484e0995c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":225576,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lutz Becker","original_name":"Lutz Becker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4698c3a368484e0995bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0358451","wikidata_id":"Q123289104","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/91btXQvMa87ons4po0pAwqybBtU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hs5eqz2nxVJTw1ZJlIRKCS0nKQG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2652,"name":"nazi"},{"id":6493,"name":"republic of weimar"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
