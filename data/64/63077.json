In the middle of this highly volatile environment is the family of Walter Kuper, an energy conglomerate executive. Walter’s daughter, Cecilia, has joined the Black Storm terrorist group. Her sister Laura must choose between motherhood and the man she loves; their brother Philip has been called into fight for Germany in a hopeless war to secure the last remaining oil fields. Starring leading actors Daniel Brühl, Johanna Wokalek and Jürgen Vogel, \"The Days to Come\" asks provocative questions about the current state of things as it depicts personal and political realities in a scarily believable near–future.","popularity":0.8203,"poster_path":"/c9P2ioWN8mEDWQgdn4fnlIob6HS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11536,"logo_path":null,"name":"Badlands
