Rather than focusing on the dog fighting problem, the movie sheds light on solutions leading to \"Vicktory\" for all the underdogs in the movie - tattooed people, pitbulls, parolees and all the other people in this world that society has turned their back on through ignorance and racism. The movie also examines the life of Brandon Bond and his struggle with balancing fame, fortune and the Rock-N-Roll tattoo lifestyle with a more fulfilling life that focuses on the betterment of both animals and society as a whole. Featuring celebrities like Debbie and Danny Trejo, Michael Berryman, Pixie Acia and Donal Logue, the movie takes you on an incredible journey you will never forget!","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vicktory To The Underdog","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Victory to the Underdog","type":"typo"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":237979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Bond","original_name":"Brandon Bond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe46bcc3a368484e0a0e85","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1499944","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
