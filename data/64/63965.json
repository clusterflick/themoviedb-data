It is about fame and our culture of obsession. Actor Darren McWarren (Jason Gann) starred in soap, mini-series and film before destroying his career with a series of indiscretions. Now McWarren is out of the industry and living in a small town in Western Victoria he can do whatever he wants. When a journalist decides to write a \"Where are they now\" profile on McWarren, he finds the former star has become a modern day Errol Flynn. The local girls want to fornicate with him and their fellas want to fight him. He mightn't have found love - but it's the next best thing.","popularity":0.3505,"poster_path":"/r5wkNytf7CzO16prJ1P5774FTOh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Never meet your heroes.","title":"Rats and Cats","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Gann","original_name":"Jason Gann","popularity":0.4098,"profile_path":"/kpyPH3VWaMxID4i9nE834RX4Z8Z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Darren McWarren","credit_id":"52fe46c3c3a368484e0a2689","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Zwar","original_name":"Adam Zwar","popularity":0.1667,"profile_path":"/ohRnTfsGaRjHVa8QG0BT7E5TMMX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ben","credit_id":"563e3ec7c3a3681b6102c8bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anya Beyersdorf","original_name":"Anya Beyersdorf","popularity":0.1051,"profile_path":"/fiwX3yuno2URjZXhutgzQQCFR2R.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cindy","credit_id":"52fe46c3c3a368484e0a2691","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":182538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Denny","original_name":"Paul Denny","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bruce","credit_id":"52fe46c3c3a368484e0a2695","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tony Rogers","original_name":"Tony Rogers","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57318816c3a36803d4001acc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1194437","wikidata_id":"Q18166399","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1494,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r5wkNytf7CzO16prJ1P5774FTOh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":996}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
