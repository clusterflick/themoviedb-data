Operation Chariot, as the raid was codenamed, had a simple aim – to destroy the dry dock and thus deny the German battleship Tirpitz a safe haven on the Atlantic coast of France. There were many who thought the mission too risky, but the Chief of Combined Operations, Louis Mountbatten, pushed forward. This programme explores the story around March 26th 1942, when Commandos in Cornwall boarded their floating bomb and set off to see if the element of surprise really could overcome all the odds.","popularity":0.2617,"poster_path":"/kW8lftqT6AsaHuHvGunA6ddSpf4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18753,"logo_path":"/sFyZVc90OIHYISn7SjWA19qZUE.png","name":"North One Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Greatest Raid of All Time","video":false,"vote_average":9.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Jeremy Clarkson: Greatest Raid of All Time","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Clarkson","original_name":"Jeremy Clarkson","popularity":0.8334,"profile_path":"/8tnYaTYfbSzmGyHeEeBCoNUzCdZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"52fe46c1c3a368484e0a2095","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1016196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Beattie","original_name":"Sam Beattie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46c1c3a368484e0a20a5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1016197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micky Burn","original_name":"Micky Burn","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46c1c3a368484e0a20a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1016198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric de la Torre","original_name":"Eric de la Torre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46c1c3a368484e0a20ad","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Clarkson","original_name":"Jeremy Clarkson","popularity":0.8334,"profile_path":"/8tnYaTYfbSzmGyHeEeBCoNUzCdZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46c1c3a368484e0a20a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Pearson","original_name":"Richard Pearson","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54fdb3b19251416c320011c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0996628","wikidata_id":"Q110905097","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xQWOc2PJKGBXq5uP7LzlETIrY3y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1778}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kW8lftqT6AsaHuHvGunA6ddSpf4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
