They name the cub Masha, raise her and release her back into the wild. Three years go by, and Emily is lost deep in the forest. Cold, frightened and alone in the darkness, she falls and is knocked unconscious. When she awakens, Emily is amazed to see that a brown bear has kept her warm and dry all night by cuddling her. It's Masha â€“ and Emily is overjoyed to be reunited with the bear just when she needs a friend most. Together the two bravely set off on an adventure to find their way home. Bear With Me is a tale the whole family will find as exciting as it is heart-warming . . . and the magnificent forests of the Pacific Northwest lend this story of loyalty, friendship and adventure a magic all its own.","popularity":1.1758,"poster_path":"/hrYtSVMk7KwDMYQHhPzaoIHON6I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A friend in need is a bear indeed.","title":"Bear with Me","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Mon amie Masha","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1198529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaitlyn Burke","original_name":"Kaitlyn Burke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Emily Bradley","credit_id":"52fe46c3c3a368484e0a24b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Ontkean","original_name":"Michael Ontkean","popularity":0.5206,"profile_path":"/v7CFUrcd0G2wtDfKvLy3hTVx9Ix.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Greg Bradley","credit_id":"52fe46c3c3a368484e0a24bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Shaver","original_name":"Helen Shaver","popularity":1.0266,"profile_path":"/4RcaswFfLR8D3bQBHVlxyBR0R0H.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sara Bradley","credit_id":"52fe46c3c3a368484e0a24bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":102749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberley Warnat","original_name":"Kimberley Warnat","popularity":0.3379,"profile_path":"/cdGjZDj3Fg6KWm2xyLrT9im4xBR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Melissa Bradley","credit_id":"52fe46c3c3a368484e0a24c3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Tootoosis","original_name":"Gordon Tootoosis","popularity":0.2998,"profile_path":"/ls9gOUs7nSZyutuL5MULC1PZftN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"John Ours","credit_id":"52fe46c3c3a368484e0a24c7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Johnson","original_name":"Eric Johnson","popularity":0.7851,"profile_path":"/oSwKvCo9duqcOfUAYPLdNHyXnna.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Scott Robinson","credit_id":"52fe46c3c3a368484e0a24cb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristian Ayre","original_name":"Kristian Ayre","popularity":0.456,"profile_path":"/8xzeqFjzLMrFegDMm4vv986Kvp5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Daniel","credit_id":"52fe46c3c3a368484e0a24cf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Abrahams","original_name":"Doug Abrahams","popularity":0.4764,"profile_path":"/u4M8YZGbZdJfqTttOGNDiVRa0MP.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sgt.
