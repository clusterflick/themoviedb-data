A progressive social worker has Harley sent to Texas to live with the Nortons, an open-minded, heartful Christian family, and spend two months on their ranch. Surrounded by a town full of doddering hicks, Harley takes on ranch chores, learns to ride horses, and finds love in a local girl while the Nortons try to bring him into the fold. Eventually Harley chooses to release his pain in exchange for a return to faith, culminating in his calling for God's help to save the life of the burglar who framed him.","popularity":0.4904,"poster_path":"/dpVGQsCXvJ7zdwaGAbQRvzTRadb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182180,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kuntz Bros., Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harley","video":false,"vote_average":2.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Diamond Phillips","original_name":"Lou Diamond Phillips","popularity":1.917,"profile_path":"/yqGZwaGe8XgoxfO7zmx7weGBaXZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Harley","credit_id":"52fe4e71c3a368484e22103b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":194401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eli Cummins","original_name":"Eli Cummins","popularity":0.174,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"52fe4e71c3a368484e22103f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1204902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan DeWitt","original_name":"Jan DeWitt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Judy","credit_id":"52fe4e71c3a368484e221043","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":158764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Valentine","original_name":"Kim Valentine","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/gPo71xeJzG1goIVNsJIy9CdLw3C.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bobby","credit_id":"63f4b40c15376c007819e09e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1864298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Sheets","original_name":"Chad Sheets","popularity":0.0786,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Joey","credit_id":"6451c30987a27a01723bc051","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3677107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Kuntz","original_name":"Frank Kuntz","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Frank","credit_id":"6451c31fc044290122caf6e5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3677108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darryl Kuntz","original_name":"Darryl Kuntz","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Darryl","credit_id":"6451c330c044290143e267e9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":580875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thom Meyers","original_name":"Thom Meyers","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Leach","credit_id":"63f4b413a24c501339e3264b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2154971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Shaeffer","original_name":"Karl Shaeffer","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Chihuahua","credit_id":"6451c35ad8f44e011ae14517","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1193812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Humann","original_name":"Helena Humann","popularity":0.1554,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Ethel","credit_id":"6451c37ac04429010160d91c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":194120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harlan Jordan","original_name":"Harlan Jordan","popularity":0.2536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Vernon","credit_id":"6451c3a0105611011c0325b6","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3649713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Kassel","original_name":"Dale Kassel","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"6451c3d1c0442900e2f08112","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4041773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David W.
