Mikalojus Konstantinas Ciurlionis was born into a Lithuanian peasant family in 1875. Despite his lowly origins he soon revealed himself to be a child prodigy able to both paint and compose music of startling and often frightening intensity. Soon after he was struck down by a mysterious mental illness, which would plague him for the rest of his life. During his short lifetime, Ciurlionis produced over 300 paintings and 300 musical compositions. Supporting him throughout his short and painful life was his beloved wife, Sofija Kymantaite, a journalist and political activist.","popularity":0.387,"poster_path":"/39ItHSHBDAQfKW8nxJqQmkpLKYp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27758,"logo_path":"/je3uCVqOU6CTnbAHRuVQrz8rug4.png","name":"Artbox","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2013-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Lithuanian Love Affair","title":"Letters To Sofija","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1204408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rokas Zubovas","original_name":"Rokas Zubovas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis","credit_id":"52fe4e6cc3a368484e21fc11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1204409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marija Korenkaitė","original_name":"Marija Korenkaitė","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sofija Kymantaitė","credit_id":"52fe4e6cc3a368484e21fc15","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1378668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Artūras Aleksejevas","original_name":"Artūras Aleksejevas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/yE1jvaInoitrfk4nHQoQoRMGHAe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Fyodor Michaelovich","credit_id":"67b5ddbb2152638f5ee3dcaa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3332568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romualdas Lavrynovičius","original_name":"Rugilė Alytaitė","popularity":0.0556,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dobuzhinsky daughter","credit_id":"67b5de2260b18a5698dfe323","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3782885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rimvydas Ambrazevičius","original_name":"Rimvydas Ambrazevičius","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dying man","credit_id":"67b5de459e32f72b4d88ddb8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolaj Antonov","original_name":"Nikolaj Antonov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Captain Nikolai Rostov","credit_id":"67b5de6e3751180bfcdfe0c4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saulius Balandis","original_name":"Saulius Balandis","popularity":0.1546,"profile_path":"/q588EaSCRahUlWIKj1Xa2mSbeGG.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Prince Michal Oginski","credit_id":"67b5de9fd28e87e0e5e3cdf0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrius Bialobžeskis","original_name":"Andrius Bialobžeskis","popularity":0.2027,"profile_path":"/37ui4ClwVDqOrtAeQIjgblYTR2g.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mstislav Dobuzhinsky","credit_id":"67b5dfbbd28e87e0e5e3cec8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2218092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomas Bimbiris","original_name":"Tomas Bimbiris","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"MK Čiurlionis (aged 17)","credit_id":"67b5e07f60b18a5698dfe4a6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolandas Boravskis","original_name":"Rolandas Boravskis","popularity":0.163,"profile_path":"/jJL1paMJsb19SQdTnYp5SHqoD77.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Fr.
