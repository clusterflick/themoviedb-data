The Tigress, a gorgeous, wild, and very independent street walker, falls for a handsome grifter. When one of her lovers gets jealous, she betrays him and has to skip town. The grifter reveals he has what it takes to move in upper class circles and suggests they flee to Carlsbad, a spa in Czechoslovakia. Does he love her or is he only using her? Is the Tigress madly in love with him or does she want to satisfy her vanity and drop him once he falls for her? The ancient cat and mouse game between a man and a woman unfolds amidst sensual seduction, the scheme of robbing a rich Texan and the jilted lover arriving from Berlin, gun drawn.","popularity":0.9255,"poster_path":"/bv5P6NTfoF5JwNVvOZ7v0BGF8Wu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1766,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dieter Geissler Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1979,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinevox Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tigress","video":false,"vote_average":4.143,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Vargas","original_name":"Valentina Vargas","popularity":0.5112,"profile_path":"/kS45i62uoGlnd9HmxTaA0DjiLk2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pauline","credit_id":"52fe4e60c3a368484e21d4a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Remar","original_name":"James Remar","popularity":1.7318,"profile_path":"/ctMVpFDKKWCty60lLORf3IoJcv9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Andrei","credit_id":"52fe4e60c3a368484e21d4a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Peppard","original_name":"George Peppard","popularity":1.1539,"profile_path":"/td2SN1HGqgGsWLi4YhReMYvH2ik.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sid Slaughter","credit_id":"52fe4e60c3a368484e21d4ab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferdy Mayne","original_name":"Ferdy Mayne","popularity":0.3111,"profile_path":"/7l73nDzdFBae78sEaY4xWxEmRV4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Viennese Count","credit_id":"55d19ca5c3a3686da400145c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Belinda Mayne","original_name":"Belinda Mayne","popularity":0.1528,"profile_path":"/tgTsVHu96vG389Eqbg0YOnr0GFa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Elsy","credit_id":"55d19cd2c3a3681bff009c75","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannes Jaenicke","original_name":"Hannes Jaenicke","popularity":0.2109,"profile_path":"/v8tuXD74U4ZBf2q0PmCK5VZ5m1n.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"55d19cf592514142b4006d0f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Schoenenberger","original_name":"René Schoenenberger","popularity":0.0931,"profile_path":"/4Gbn2sHZ5vGWAREhrZeo52ksqqa.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Count Beowulf","credit_id":"55d19d0f92514142b4006d16","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arne Nannestad","original_name":"Arne Nannestad","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"5d1cb2a394d8a8000f3e6df5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lutz Stückrath","original_name":"Lutz Stückrath","popularity":0.1269,"profile_path":"/g2iDN1NzktCjJ0G821mMh6euOam.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"5d1cb2aca13533000f06a480","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiří Krytinář","original_name":"Jiří Krytinář","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":"/c0h56XPXlCvb5HSwVOC8KolX3xG.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"5d1cb2c5283ed90011188160","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Goebel","original_name":"Christian Goebel","popularity":0.2125,"profile_path":"/8JSUueojdiDfO9n0xqjaMG02HHd.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"5d1cb2dd94d8a831163bbc70","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":24099,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karin Howard","original_name":"Karin Howard","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e60c3a368484e21d49f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49044,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Loek Dikker","original_name":"Loek Dikker","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635b3a00894ed6007dea185e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22847,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karl-Ernst Sasse","original_name":"Karl-Ernst Sasse","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635b3a151b7294007bef0806","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37339,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lothar E.
