David Lee Birdsong is the smalltown quarterback hoping to escape with a college scholarship and a pro career. David's father is the overbearing taskmaster vicariously living through his son. The third side of the triangle is Coach Marshall, a hypercritical and cruel man who sees David as the key to his future success. David's lockstep commitment to his father and coach is altered when he witnesses a teammate die after a grueling practice.","popularity":2.1325,"poster_path":"/j91aX2FhqvGj8hxMOmmn6y0Iu9D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1556,"logo_path":"/31h94rG9hzjprXoYNy3L1ErUya2.png","name":"20th Century Fox
