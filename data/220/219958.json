Through Luís de Camões and Prince Henry the Navigator, through its Viking ships and dizzying bridges, the Douro is a great witness to the history and culture of Portugal. Jean Rouch and Manoel de Oliveira are walking alongside while reciting a poem written by de Oliveira himself. During their walk, they reflect upon documentary-making, the charm of the river, and what it represents to them.","popularity":0.1106,"poster_path":"/io0y0siYs6fE3QwslyGzOrQK5XY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Friendly Handshake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manoel de Oliveira","original_name":"Manoel de Oliveira","popularity":0.2257,"profile_path":"/ehZkNJjHu1mtq5Aa6OG9gtkODlc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6473ebd15cd16e00bf11b625","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Rouch","original_name":"Jean Rouch","popularity":0.2114,"profile_path":"/808sK0h9rZ5ljP2bOxyyvLmbDn7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6473ebd7a894d600a98b3f25","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Rouch","original_name":"Jean Rouch","popularity":0.2114,"profile_path":"/808sK0h9rZ5ljP2bOxyyvLmbDn7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e71c3a368484e221077","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manoel de Oliveira","original_name":"Manoel de Oliveira","popularity":0.2257,"profile_path":"/ehZkNJjHu1mtq5Aa6OG9gtkODlc.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e71c3a368484e22107d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4085954,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"François Di Dio","original_name":"François Di Dio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6473ebbca199a60116c7ad8e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manoel de Oliveira","original_name":"Manoel de Oliveira","popularity":0.2257,"profile_path":"/ehZkNJjHu1mtq5Aa6OG9gtkODlc.jpg","credit_id":"6473eb00be2d490133a49f80","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350167,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Françoise Belloux","original_name":"Françoise Belloux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6473ebab5cd16e00f9af76fd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900320,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jérôme Blumberg","original_name":"Jérôme Blumberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6473eb0cbe2d4900f9945100","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5906508","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.649,"height":771,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/5MfwaUsOXn1oSyCpe2tqPKHZVFx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/io0y0siYs6fE3QwslyGzOrQK5XY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/iim38NBCt7FIbFSpk1sV9Yr3CBh.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":640},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vKgNQkBhv26fxnddrgQLad0cQbv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
