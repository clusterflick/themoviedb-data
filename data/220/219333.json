Her best friend Andrea Wolf played the lead role, that of a woman warrior dressed in leather and mounted on a motorcycle. The engagement expressed in the formal grammar of exploitation films later became Wolf’s political praxis: She went to fight alongside the PKK in the Kurdish regions between Turkey and northern Iraq, where she was killed in 1998. Now honoured by Kurds as an “immortal revolutionary,” her portrait is carried at demonstrations.","popularity":0.1927,"poster_path":"/lUhsfT6puJmFrOzFVUc85KW40RP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2004-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"November","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4405420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Wolf","original_name":"Andrea Wolf","popularity":0.2144,"profile_path":"/6ZdK3YSqrFrcrxkRL8D9tytWsI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6568ecacea84c700c7f5feb9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1204210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hito Steyerl","original_name":"Hito Steyerl","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/dL8oPhT9JdVYfPqvGUK8CrODNgY.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e64c3a368484e21e399","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17042,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Greg Harrison","original_name":"Greg Harrison","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e707b41357c00001145eb20","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17048,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nancy Schreiber","original_name":"Nancy Schreiber","popularity":0.1268,"profile_path":"/vu2SJcVX4naMHe4zRPT4vbXRTWF.jpg","credit_id":"5e707b53cedac400194edb42","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":17047,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lew Baldwin","original_name":"Lew Baldwin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e707b60357c00001145ebbf","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":17043,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Benjamin Brand","original_name":"Benjamin Brand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e707b71cabfe40018170fef","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17042,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Greg Harrison","original_name":"Greg Harrison","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e707b7bcedac400134e9ede","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lUhsfT6puJmFrOzFVUc85KW40RP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Duisburger Filmwoche","release_date":"2004-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
