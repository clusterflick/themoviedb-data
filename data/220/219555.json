She's closed the business to fly away with an aviator (Bluto, of course). But it's hardly what she expected; he has her painting his plane, while it's flying; when she says she's rather go back to Popeye, he tries to throw her off the plane. Popeye sees this, and takes off in a plane, just in time to help her out. The boys get into a dogfight, and Bluto manages to demolish Popeye's plane.","popularity":0.3866,"poster_path":"/uPouOoNFbh96RlXakBLC8tyImWC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleischer Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Never Changes My Altitude","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Popeye (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"57c110c8c3a3684bbf003b87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gus Wicke","original_name":"Gus Wicke","popularity":0.0781,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bluto (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"57c110d3c3a36833a2002193","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Olive Oyl (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"57c110e1c3a36833eb0020f1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Fleischer","original_name":"Dave Fleischer","popularity":0.3152,"profile_path":"/wSsZ2FuFstd6Ed0D6h94TwYlVuq.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e69c3a368484e21f305","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123495,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Willard Bowsky","original_name":"Willard Bowsky","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f77f3481f748b003626e190","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":606084,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Max Fleischer","original_name":"Max Fleischer","popularity":0.14,"profile_path":"/m4i8FwtAeh3u1J01cdFsCf0G6VB.jpg","credit_id":"5f77f350d4d50900340c5b5d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928927,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sammy Timberg","original_name":"Sammy Timberg","popularity":0.1586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f77f35721621b003631532b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123495,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Willard Bowsky","original_name":"Willard Bowsky","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f77f35e6728a80038fefff1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orestes Calpini","original_name":"Orestes Calpini","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f77f3657b7b4d00386c4047","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0029037","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b7no7QcycBCCGnRbcx4AsN0ca8j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uPouOoNFbh96RlXakBLC8tyImWC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dNIkUP2FG91HoLocDKkRp0ZsDsh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
