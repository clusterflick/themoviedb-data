We see his daughters, Mary and Anne, playing in the aftermath of a January, 1936, snowstorm. Next, indoors, the girls bring in a birthday cake and sing to Archie. He has Anne read to him from a children's book, and a year later, has her read aloud to show her progress. Anne and Mary dress up Pat the family dog in a dress and scarf and hold a tea party, chattering away. Archie's high-pitched voice provides narration on and off camera.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fJk2FWtuvZ4F7mrE2a63bpOs9fH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Early Amateur Sound Film","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1204302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Archie Stewart","original_name":"Archie Stewart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e67c3a368484e21ee0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0309551","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2942,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fJk2FWtuvZ4F7mrE2a63bpOs9fH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1961}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
