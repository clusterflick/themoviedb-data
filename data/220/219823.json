They have no children. As he is preparing to go on a vacation to the seaside, he strikes up an acquaintance with Paul, a young working-class boy, and decides to bring him along. This is Paul's first glimpse of how the other half lives, with their first-class hotels and so on. When he meets some aristocratic young people at the resort, he tries to put over the fiction that he is of their class, with poor success.","popularity":0.2182,"poster_path":"/pMivTiWFazqe1ERVTe9x4ocGbj2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinépol","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":63237,"logo_path":null,"name":"O.C.F.","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1971-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
