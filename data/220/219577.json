Tom breaks out, but falls off a pier as the cans roll under him. A shark chases him out of the water; Tom drops an anchor on the shark. Meanwhile, Jerry has been hopping in his can; Tom opens it, and puts his finger in, which Jerry bites. Jerry tricks Tom into falling off the end of another pier, and right into the shark's path again. The shark manages to get Tom into a very precarious position, barely holding the jaws apart. Jerry takes pity, and dumps a shaker full of pepper into the shark, which ends up on the processing line and stuffed into a huge can. Tom is unrepentant, so Jerry tricks him with a fake shark fin.","popularity":0.3667,"poster_path":"/qPSvZ5E1F02ceP8aBI6F28tRtwq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cannery Rodent","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chuck Jones","original_name":"Chuck Jones","popularity":0.4093,"profile_path":"/6LaYJXpfX6hry3mT8QTEGCPIUdi.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e69c3a368484e21f41b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179923,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Maurice Noble","original_name":"Maurice Noble","popularity":0.298,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfb569f26dac100175b368e","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0061444","wikidata_id":"Q3701090","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ebbugtnUYlGj6QHbB5EXQDu6xI1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1668,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qPSvZ5E1F02ceP8aBI6F28tRtwq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1112},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8aRibFFnjM2LDD1ObNEqosgAEfr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
