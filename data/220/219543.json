It's winter, and the hustling crowds at best ignore her, and some are outright rude. She takes shelter and, to try to stave off the cold a bit, lights a match. It gets blown out; this happens again, then on the third try, she falls into a dream. In this dream, cherubs attend her, she gets a new doll, then a new dress. The cherubs put her on a throne. Then a storm comes, and she goes toward a candle. That candle goes out, and we see that back in the real world, so did her match and her life. An angel comes along and takes her soul.","popularity":0.1321,"poster_path":"/lHke1VmCu2s1HGk95Ajn20ohkUi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Match Girl","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":573540,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Arthur Davis","original_name":"Arthur Davis","popularity":0.1964,"profile_path":"/hNsp76FpjJFdtEeBOcnR0PSBNM7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e69c3a368484e21f229","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":785866,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cal Howard","original_name":"Cal Howard","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5db5a90e0a262e9502be9d","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1054825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sid Marcus","original_name":"Sid Marcus","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/bMPvXnD5uehHE4QH7CUOrQlxl76.jpg","credit_id":"5b5db5b4c3a36842240298d6","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1054825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sid Marcus","original_name":"Sid Marcus","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/bMPvXnD5uehHE4QH7CUOrQlxl76.jpg","credit_id":"5b5db598c3a3684221030bab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":573540,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Arthur Davis","original_name":"Arthur Davis","popularity":0.1964,"profile_path":"/hNsp76FpjJFdtEeBOcnR0PSBNM7.jpg","credit_id":"5b5db5c9c3a368422702b003","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1431668,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Mintz","original_name":"Charles Mintz","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7be8df92514156ae47c469","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455025,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joe DeNat","original_name":"Joe DeNat","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7be8eac3a36819321b6934","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222245,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Emery Hawkins","original_name":"Emery Hawkins","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7be8fd0e0a2637cb11a60c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0029151","wikidata_id":"Q1500215","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lHke1VmCu2s1HGk95Ajn20ohkUi.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1418,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8G6KR17QyXhVV9ZhbPA737NeYAC.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":945},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8WVwQEaDQ6L0Hn5PukIOpMv2LJk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
