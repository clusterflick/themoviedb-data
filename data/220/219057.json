Everything went wrong: technical problems forced him to complete  the film as a silent; viewers were baffled by the lack of a recognizable  plot; then, the ideological climate of the Soviet Union changed. He was  now being blamed for catering to bourgeois taste! Time has come to set  the record straight. Here’s lyrical cinema at its best, deliberately operatic  and yet intimate as it matches the characters’ inner life with the solemn  rhythms of nature, and depicted through breathtaking black-and-white  photography. A sensation at last year’s Pordenone fest, Pudovkin’s  long-forgotten swan song to the art of montage is resurrected by Gabriel  Thibaudeau’s emotionally charged live music performance. –PCU (USSR,  1930, 75m)","popularity":0.2632,"poster_path":"/wtQgfJsh37sIDclm0OAqutfNP4f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8970,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mezhrabpomfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1930-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Simple Case","video":false,"vote_average":5.444,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Life Is Beautiful","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Prostoy sluchay","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Рассказ о простом случае","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1423504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandr Baturin","original_name":"Aleksandr Baturin","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Langovoy","credit_id":"54d3a8959251413fc4003c65","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1423505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yevgeniya Rogulina","original_name":"Yevgeniya Rogulina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mashenka","credit_id":"54d3a89fc3a368616e0036cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1423506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariya Belousova","original_name":"Mariya Belousova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"54d3a8acc3a3686ac2003668","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1423507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrei Gorchilin","original_name":"Andrei Gorchilin","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Worker","credit_id":"54d3a8b9c3a368616e0036dc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Chekulaeva","original_name":"Анна Чекулаева","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Worker's wife","credit_id":"54d3a911c3a3686ac200367d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Novoseltsev","original_name":"Ivan Novoseltsev","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":"/cOSXrwxPtxhOYjLCnxsE6grrhgZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Vasya","credit_id":"54d3a9199251413fd3003cb5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandr Chistyakov","original_name":"Aleksandr Chistyakov","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/2gKB2gLGOABX1i1zRHfyy2cwJzZ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Uncle Sasha","credit_id":"54d3a9229251413fcd003da5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1423509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"V.
