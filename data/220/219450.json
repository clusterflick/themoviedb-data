Blue smoke forms a background; a grid of black lines is the foreground. Behind the lines, a triangle appears, then patterns of multiple triangles. Their movements reflect the music's rhythm. Behind the barrier of the black lines, the triangle moves, jumps, and takes on multiple shapes. In contrast with the blue and the black, the triangles are warm: orange, red, yellow. The black lines bend, swirl into a vortex, then disappear. The triangle pulsates and a set of many of them rises.","popularity":0.2196,"poster_path":"/a5af99csBjjG2ZP89VJtrJ5SMj5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116657,"logo_path":null,"name":"Expanding Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Escape (Synchronomy No. 4)","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Synchromy No. 4: Escape","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Escape","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67826,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johann Sebastian Bach","original_name":"Johann Sebastian Bach","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/l8QFP8Pt4IQc4iQPvYbgIyNTEXX.jpg","credit_id":"627e76fdfd140b0069d86db6","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1111407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Ellen Bute","original_name":"Mary Ellen Bute","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/D9vJ1Q994vHhDlPkgFo3ifm4Go.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e67c3a368484e21ee79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Nemeth","original_name":"Ted Nemeth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jXi8fwyjGpoZrF9TOT9ix0i6nLD.jpg","credit_id":"65afff5c71ffdf010bd4120b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1111407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Ellen Bute","original_name":"Mary Ellen Bute","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/D9vJ1Q994vHhDlPkgFo3ifm4Go.jpg","credit_id":"65afff7a158c8500ac1d5089","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Nemeth","original_name":"Ted Nemeth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jXi8fwyjGpoZrF9TOT9ix0i6nLD.jpg","credit_id":"66e480a6f467c2ad62f9a24e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0028835","wikidata_id":"Q68926584","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/a5af99csBjjG2ZP89VJtrJ5SMj5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":213891,"name":"abstract"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":290719,"name":"visual music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"XK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Anibar Film festival","release_date":"2013-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
