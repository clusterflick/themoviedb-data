In his 1964 short Electronics in the World of Tomorrow, Kurenniemi presents a slideshow of the most aseptic signs of technological imagination: diagrams, chips, machines, cold surfaces. But footage of human warmth also comes up - mostly in black and white, as if to give humans the status of a memory.  Originally silent, the film was in this version endowed with a electronic music piece by Kurenneimi himself: a cold, aggressive soundtrack that could be said to present technology as a potentially menacing affair, although this is a reading that the director would certainly refute.","popularity":0.1422,"poster_path":"/iRb8fiQzz26yM94LHD7KchGAZ35.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Electronics in the World of Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342731,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erkki Kurenniemi","original_name":"Erkki Kurenniemi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c83e8fc3a36862600044b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342731,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erkki Kurenniemi","original_name":"Erkki Kurenniemi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd2455422931a003f6d01e1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3075002","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iRb8fiQzz26yM94LHD7KchGAZ35.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/swSOANxyJwtQgOVxn9JmDnc2OHP.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254287,"name":"semiconductor"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":315755,"name":"electric circuits"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"'Electronics In The World Of Tomorrow' (1964) by Erkki Kurenniemi","key":"KjpPJugj6SY","published_at":"2011-03-19T11:01:51.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"54654d8d0e0a26293b002b7d"}]}}}
