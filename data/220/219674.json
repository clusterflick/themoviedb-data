Instead, he buys a plane ticket to Italy, gets robbed upon arrival and winds up in Bologna in the care of his new friend Lele (Lele Gabellone), the self-proclaimed King of Bologna, who lives with a scraggly punkabbestia, Ballo (Gianlucca Bazzoli), and the insatiable prostitute frequenter, Il Pisa (Giuseppe Sanfelice). In Bologna, Lele teaches Chrlie the subtle strategies that the King knows so well, namely hitting on Italian women, throwing all-night parties and inciting general anarchy. Charlie takes to it like a pro and in the process meets the dangerously beautiful Valentina (Alessandra Mastronardi) and all-American Jessica (Eva Amurri).","popularity":0.8726,"poster_path":"/40XPDUyq8jO2xGTJvFlaFCppSBw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2013-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"bologna italy student road movie","title":"Eurotrapped","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Euro Trapped","type":"Comedy"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"AmeriQua","type":"Comedy"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1204430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert F.
