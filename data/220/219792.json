At the time, it was radical example of symbolist abstraction. Its success inspired a film version, Enhver [Everyman], directed by Vilhelm Glückstadt for Filmfabrikken Danmark. The film, however, was set in a modern-day environment. It depict the moral choice confronting its protagonist at struggle because two attendant spirits, one good and one bad. The protagonist is tempted by dark figure of evil and succumbs, rejecting God and leading a life of iniquity, but he is then haunted by guilty visions until he finally dies, asking God for forgiveness at the last moment.","popularity":0.1149,"poster_path":"/6Xr9VNnOHb2xVduuSdhR5qRXW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everyman","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Everyman","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Anyone","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Det gamle spil om enhver","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter S.
