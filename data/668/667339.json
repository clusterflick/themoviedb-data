The film begins today, twenty years later, when Natasha returns for the first time to her unknown home. Natasha's time in Baikal Port is mainly structured through her everyday encounters with the people who live there. In different situations, she meets them and gets into conversations about employment and living conditions that are still marked by the effects of the Perestroika. While Natasha gains these intimate insights into different ways of living, she reflects on her own position and tries to make a connection with this place, which is a part of her identity. The cinematic drawing of intimate portraits of people living in Baikal Port as well as Natasha’s play- acting as a returning, identity-seeking figure is accompanied by an ever-present recording camera.","popularity":0.0498,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Standing in Front of Many Houses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Gde ostalsya domovoy","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2522092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekaterina Reinbold","original_name":"Ekaterina Reinbold","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2ec4b9c56d2d00134e31db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2522092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekaterina Reinbold","original_name":"Ekaterina Reinbold","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f99f4d69f5dfb00352673f5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Max Ophüls Prize Film Festival","release_date":"2020-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2020-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ГДЕ ОСТАЛСЯ ДОМОВОЙ / STANDING IN FRONT OF MANY HOUSES","key":"381776566","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-12-28T14:01:08.000Z","id":"5f99f473992fe600392c57e6"}]}}}
