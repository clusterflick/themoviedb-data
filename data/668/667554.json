Set in the small desert town of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, the film takes place in the shadow of a nearby Spaceport and the commercial exploration of space. Through the lives of the people in town and a filmmaker from the future, the film explores progress, echoes of history, and how we each navigate a sense of loss, within ourselves and within a changing world.","popularity":0.7335,"poster_path":"/mT3TQu5wBZHTQibaJYMwCePAHHO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
