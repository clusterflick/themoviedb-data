Now 90-year-old, Paul Nizon grants insights into his life and work in a self-ironic, direct manner. The intimate portrait of a great literary outsider emerges, for whom the risk of life and the risk of writing merge into one and the same work of art.","popularity":0.2563,"poster_path":"/wTvKxKrdyVigz7L29OyOvnXYRB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10358,"logo_path":"/pvgiWovEFHYoOO49V7arAhitWTM.png","name":"Ventura Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":20960,"logo_path":"/9mO8Z3dcW6ISVMeCv7TbXtWXdGl.png","name":"RSI","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":12431,"logo_path":"/3m45frhaRCLsCKuMtuj7ZwfGwBB.png","name":"SRG SSR","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2020-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paul Nizon: Der Nagel im Kopf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","title":"Paul Nizon: Le clou dans la tête","type":"French title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2521123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Nizon","original_name":"Paul Nizon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e2d6a1498f1f10014fb36b8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68659,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andres Pfäffli","original_name":"Andres Pfäffli","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/e2U37ISWBs6FdeH8jc0uysjxiJu.jpg","credit_id":"61f94fb7bb1057001daeccfe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2114251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mehdi Sahebi","original_name":"Mehdi Sahebi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/k5jD8HSlVaXldE1Qgh3R3VfTIUq.jpg","credit_id":"5e2d6a764ca676001748ee08","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172478,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Scherer","original_name":"Peter Scherer","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":"/wzVB4ydOeEOoOXBgDOPFaUBmRuf.jpg","credit_id":"5e2d6a9fc56d2d00184cda10","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Kühn","original_name":"Christoph Kühn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2d6a2d98f1f1000ffb4a33","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68658,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elda Guidinetti","original_name":"Elda Guidinetti","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2d6a4ac56d2d001a4c823e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1033122,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Silvana Bezzola Rigolini","original_name":"Silvana Bezzola Rigolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2d6a5a1685da0019e7755d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Kühn","original_name":"Christoph Kühn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2d6a254ca676001247c3dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67019,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stéphane Kuthy","original_name":"Stéphane Kuthy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2d6a674ca676001a47f5f0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451826,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Kieffer","original_name":"Jacques Kieffer","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2d6a834ca676001447dd68","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451826,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Kieffer","original_name":"Jacques Kieffer","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2d6a9098f1f1000ffb4c1d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2521126,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gina Keller","original_name":"Gina Keller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2d6b92c56d2d00134ca293","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11559374","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wTvKxKrdyVigz7L29OyOvnXYRB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":90,"name":"paris, france"},{"id":1223,"name":"switzerland"},{"id":13028,"name":"writer"},{"id":170356,"name":"outsider"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"55.
