He may not have broken dramatic new ground in the same way as his musical colleagues Liszt and Wagner, who invented new genres. Instead, his innovations took place at the mircro-level – within music’s inner palm. In this respect Brahms was far ahead of his time – and this fact explains what half a century later Arnold Schoenberg regards him as “progressive” and was referring to him for his own compositional theory.","popularity":0.2593,"poster_path":"/A4NLrjHqquQj11MiHuTYItnBbiZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brahms - Symphonies No. 3 and 4 / Semyon Bychkov, WDR Sinfonieorchester Koln","video":true,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1633621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Semyon Bychkov","original_name":"Semyon Bychkov","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5e2cf4fb1fb94f001a376cfe","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A4NLrjHqquQj11MiHuTYItnBbiZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1217,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jBfVYRqdGtcEeW4IPaHMt0ynbTy.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":857}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":190202,"name":"brahms"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SYMPHONIES Nos. 3 | Johannes Brahms | WDR Sinfonieorchester Köln: Semyon Bychkov | ARTHAUS MUSIK","key":"351574537","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-08-02T08:25:23.000Z","id":"5e2cf5894ca676001a4771c1"}]}}}
