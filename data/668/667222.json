But who knows the real Hitchcock? During his last public appearance, \"Hitch\" paid tribute to the wife, mother, co-writer, editor and partner of a lifetime that was Alma Reville Hitchcock. The two Hitchcock were inseparable, engineering the unquestionable masterpieces together. Their genuine collaboration never stopped from the day they met until the end of their lives. It's in light of this fusional relationship that this film will revisit and shed fresh light on the legend.","popularity":0.6306,"poster_path":"/l5czvw08MyGutniC0mnAGLID1Sa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91242,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nilaya Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitchcock Confidential","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Alma Reville - Na Sombra de Hitchcock","type":"RTP"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred Hitchcock","original_name":"Alfred Hitchcock","popularity":1.3971,"profile_path":"/108fiNM6poRieMg7RIqLJRxdAwG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e516fcbf48b3400176e9a1d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3681,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alma Reville","original_name":"Alma Reville","popularity":0.256,"profile_path":"/OymC0wspclYbyiL2lagCO6T7pW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e51700435811d0017561175","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cary Grant","original_name":"Cary Grant","popularity":1.1701,"profile_path":"/7wVWukDgz9lr4qbNqnRwdMMVgBs.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e51727df48b3400176ea40f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa Lepoivre","original_name":"Elsa Lepoivre","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/xL5VWHQRXICEwuH31ruusu27xV2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5f540204b0460500359fcc51","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2073366,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patricia Boutinard Rouelle","original_name":"Patricia Boutinard Rouelle","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2e3221c56d2d00184d89c4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":439550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Herbiet","original_name":"Laurent Herbiet","popularity":0.1566,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2e3094a589020010658f1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1801915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick McGilligan","original_name":"Patrick McGilligan","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f54044b904f6d0037399510","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2233760,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Laure-Alice Hervé","original_name":"Laure-Alice Hervé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f54044546f35400351a3737","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162533,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sarah Turoche","original_name":"Sarah Turoche","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f540437b3316b0035f0e605","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10483816","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p7DLPBxBbB56koQvjCT7kGUBoU9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b5rU0dj7vQqmwHwmqbQ7r3j9kpk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1649,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l5czvw08MyGutniC0mnAGLID1Sa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1100},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4HQBeTdri0ZHagncjgqgZRPTwYg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":534},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tFyiUUpZ1aUOdFFehOyWjdjBfXp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d2Gqhod4g0YzSjF6WdGNJ5XXc7E.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
