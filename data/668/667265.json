A plastic angel in the window heralds the coming of the ʻLightʼ to a young woman: Barrie herself, who is both character and filmmaker. Since we see Barrieʼs vision through her eyes, we find ourselves, like Barrie, in the role of the Virgin at the moment of New Dispensation is announced and begun. Here, however, the result of the Dispensation is not a son conceived non-sexually by a male god, but a woman conceived by a female creator. While Christ is Godʼs spirit made flesh, Barrieʼs film image of herself is flesh made spirit: she transforms herself into a being of light.” -Scott MacDonald","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Annunciation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2521884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Barrie","original_name":"Diana Barrie","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2e741ec56d2d00134dd750","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
