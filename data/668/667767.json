The Mosque: A Community's Struggle is an intimate portrait of the resilient Muslim community of Ste-Foy, Québec, as they struggle to survive and shift the narrative of what it means to be a Muslim, one year after the devastating attack that took the lives of six of their members. As the world moves on, this small mosque and its community fights Islamophobia, harassment and hate speech. How will the community heal and how will they stop the rhetoric that threatens to precipitate further violence?","popularity":0.1148,"poster_path":"/ePFntbFucIku4vbBGDnDcbHMFZv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Loaded Pictures","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mosque","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"The Mosque: A Community's Struggle","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariel Nasr","original_name":"Ariel Nasr","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3080e96743fa00111dd70c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariel Nasr","original_name":"Ariel Nasr","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e30808c326c1900161d758f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2523492,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Étienne Gagnon","original_name":"Étienne Gagnon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e30807598f1f10014fe36d7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariel Nasr","original_name":"Ariel Nasr","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e308058eda4b70013f11e6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2523493,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kamila Nasr","original_name":"Kamila Nasr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3080b26743fa00171e0b41","department":"Sound","job":"Music Score Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667019,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sergeo Kirby","original_name":"Sergeo Kirby","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3080ddc56d2d00154fecd0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11579314","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"La.Mosquee.film","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2430,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ePFntbFucIku4vbBGDnDcbHMFZv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1620},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/g2szO8EZdnRHHcV3KElP9dy6wXU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3356,"name":"quebec"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":13015,"name":"terrorism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Canal D","release_date":"2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
