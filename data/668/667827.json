And these are Stefan Ager, Andreas Gumpenberger and Fabian Lentsch, fortunately. Because they have to abseil a good 50 meters to the summit from the protected Zeppelin gondola. The three freeriders find new ways not only for the approach, but also for the eagerly awaited descent.","popularity":0.0418,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":128392,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lensecape Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2019-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zeppelinskiing.
