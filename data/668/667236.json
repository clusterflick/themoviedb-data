Brought up in Barcelona, the painter, graphic artist and sculptor was drawn to Paris and, under the influence of the surrealists, developed his unique style and poetic imagery that unite Catalan folk art and fantastic elements. Robin Lough followed the 85-year-old Miró to theatre rehearsals and went to see him in his studio on Majorca. There he met with an amazingly creative and disciplined artist, whose visionary pictures paved the way for abstract expressionism.","popularity":0.2459,"poster_path":"/kgMKTh3NHKGqOEk9HHbQEF5RWTq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art Lives Series: Joan Miro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roland Penrose","original_name":"Roland Penrose","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2e45b24ca676001248c227","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Lough","original_name":"Robin Lough","popularity":0.145,"profile_path":"/iBysfAHsKK07zn0QoK2CcL9q8vo.jpg","credit_id":"5e2e45eb4ca676001248c25d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kgMKTh3NHKGqOEk9HHbQEF5RWTq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":437,"name":"painter"},{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"},{"id":6024,"name":"sculpture"},{"id":255600,"name":"ceramics"},{"id":281057,"name":"spanish"},{"id":286622,"name":"catalan"},{"id":338922,"name":"joan miró"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
