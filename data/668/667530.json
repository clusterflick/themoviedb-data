Satan instructs Ballet Master Death to assemble an orchestra of human passions (Fear, Panic, Suspicion, Hatred, Heroism, Murder etc.) to provide the music for a corps de ballet of Nations to perform the dance macabre of war.  What follows is an often-humorous assembly of the orchestra, filmed in the atmospheric cavernous tunnels beneath Bristol Temple Meads.  Following this assembly, we see the core Nations perform their dance, joined by a larger cohort of Nations for the final act, Revenge. The film is interspersed with danced sections performed by a Chorus, evocative of the choric elements of classical Greek tragedy.","popularity":0.5293,"poster_path":"/98oAKt9oot9xVjpKv4cNsemRtkw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128356,"logo_path":null,"name":"impermanence","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Billy Zane narrates this 50-minute arthouse film in which war is imagined as a diabolical dance choreographed by Satan and Ballet Master Death.","title":"The Ballet of the Nations","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Zane","original_name":"Billy Zane","popularity":1.7172,"profile_path":"/wr4fuwLzQvW1G0MS7cmQ3ObFjvL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5e2f84c198f1f10018fd5ae8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Clements","original_name":"Peter Clements","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/5ObdoWXwy3NWoumg0URlfqLGNZj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ballet Master Death","credit_id":"63f4923cfbe36f0081957b46","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1278557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonya Cullingford","original_name":"Sonya Cullingford","popularity":0.0749,"profile_path":"/mAh2P0M7ON9t7WzlVf4EYoUzDR7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Satan","credit_id":"63f49249a6725400865f0456","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2522732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joshua Bentovim","original_name":"Joshua Bentovim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2f84adc56d2d00154eb4c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2522731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roseanna Anderson","original_name":"Roseanna Anderson","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2f849a326c1900161c63c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13305380","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/98oAKt9oot9xVjpKv4cNsemRtkw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
