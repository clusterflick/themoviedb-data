Far from Paris, in the South of France, his obstinacy as man and artist made him a pioneer of a new way of seeing. Returning always to the same sujets – the Mont Sainte-Victoire, bathing figures, or still lifes – he abandoned central perspective, distorted body-shapes and broke all the traditional rules of landscape painting. Aided by experts, and descendants of the artist, Matthew Collings gives a thorough introduction to Cézanne’s life and work, exploring the lifelong artistic quest of the man whom Picasso called “my only master”.","popularity":0.1086,"poster_path":"/v3Zb64V1iLW2UWXtG30jkspd3Me.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art Lives Series: Paul Cezanne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1079442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janice Sutherland","original_name":"Janice Sutherland","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2e02b71685da0017e8f6b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1247819,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthew Collings","original_name":"Matthew Collings","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2e02938ee49c00185ec9a9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v3Zb64V1iLW2UWXtG30jkspd3Me.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"10","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
