An old pair, Antanina and her husband Viktar, sit knee by knee in their small village hut, decorated with home-made cloths. He drinks badly and wonders “what does one live in this world for?” It is very sad and gloomy in winter, but when the spring comes, the nature revives, and so do the people and the animals. Life goes on. But why does the old woman sigh so heavily? A very colorful and realistic image of old-time people microcosm. Sometimes amusing, sometimes tragic. There is swearing, quarrelling, disagreement; and at the same time harmonious coexistence of people and nature, man and woman.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kill the Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2597035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksander Nalivaiko","original_name":"Aleksander Nalivaiko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e90f877befb090012bc0654","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2173138,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yaroslav Kamensky","original_name":"Yaroslav Kamensky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e90f8c63679a100183715e5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2265202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Kutsila","original_name":"Andrei Kutsila","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bbaJkoIWWagwtMV08YtKQjpVHzI.jpg","credit_id":"5e90f7f9befb090012bc0594","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
