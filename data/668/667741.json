The exterior of the house is never seen, and the family's anxiety, as is often the case, plays out within the confines of four walls. Filmed with a dreamy, surreal quality, 'The People in the House' dwells within the tension between harmony and chaos.\" - Liz Czach, Toronto Film Festival Catalogue, Canada, 1995","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/f7yZDi4r4jKAMRmiJ44bftDpIKI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The People in the House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1704409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Bourque","original_name":"Louise Bourque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/swhC9xEcY3VixSVz4R5D0uRFrsp.jpg","credit_id":"5e30674b326c1900141d9167","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0110806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f7yZDi4r4jKAMRmiJ44bftDpIKI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
