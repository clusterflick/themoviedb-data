Caroline has always pushed herself beyond the boundaries that patriarchal society had set for her. In the 1980s, her grandson Stéphane leads a similar struggle: as a gay boy in an upper middle-class Swiss family, he seeks to escape the role of the conformist, masculine heterosexual. And as a 13-year-old, he begins recording himself and his surroundings with a video camera. From his extensive biographical image archive, as an adult director Stéphane Riethauser has gained a touching double portrait of himself and his flamboyant grandmother.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madame","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
