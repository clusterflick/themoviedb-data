The Wiggles - Anthony, Simon, Lachy and Tsehay are joined by the ‘Fruit Salad TV’ Wiggles - Evie, John, Caterina and Kelly in this all-new musical special that celebrates the everyday heroes in our community. Featuring over 20 brand new songs, Super Wiggles showcases the newest members of Wiggle Town in catchy new tunes including \"Hey Tsehay!\", \"I'm Evie, I Wear Ballet Shoes!\" and \"I'm John, I'm Strong!\". Plus, we meet new friends such as the wonderful Super Granny, Super Ballet Man, Chengwu (who demonstrates his amazing dance skills) and the multi-talented Paloma the Mermaid. Super Wiggles remind us all that not all heroes wear capes and that superheroes are everywhere, from teachers, to the lollipop person, to even the garbage truck driver.
