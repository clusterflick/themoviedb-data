Both lovers have children, and they cherish the hope that they will soon be able to take the kids to live with them. But those are only words. Alina's infidelity pushes Fenik towards reconsideration, but will it last? The film is about the manifestation of human feelings in souls ravaged by alcohol. It hints at our common responsibility for the future. One wants to think that children will be healthily immune to this syndrome and will become better than their parents. That is how it is supposed to be.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gxFiJ4phCMl0BXVd5o62eFgTzpJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2016-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gregorian Syndrome.
