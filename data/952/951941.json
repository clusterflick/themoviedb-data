The film was an early experiment by Drew and his Associates to capture real life happening in front of the cameras. They had not yet developed the new equipment that would allow portable sync-sound filming, so they improvised. Drew, who was still a correspondent for LIFE Magazine at the time, was trying to make films that would promote LIFE stories on television. This idea was how Drew had convinced Time-Life to bankroll his fledgling film unit. Although the football story never became a LIFE magazine cover story, it served as a kind of dry-run for a film about another football game covered by Drew and his Associates four years later. That film, “Mooney vs. Fowle,” led by filmmaker James Lipscomb, became an award-winning, groundbreaking documentary.","popularity":0.0824,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Football","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Drew","original_name":"Robert Drew","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62379e94df29450019e0ed6f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Drew","original_name":"Robert Drew","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623c6a38a7e363005db80af7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.
