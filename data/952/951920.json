They went seeking the Eldorado that fascist propaganda had promised them. Their dream was shattered after just a few years. The war and the fall of the regime led to the loss of the colonies, forcing them to return to Borgo having lost everything. This epic tale is revealed in the words, the written memoirs and the hundreds of photos of a few witnesses. The story unfolds in an intimacy that reveals a long silence. A colonial adventure seen from the inside.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oltremare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3473598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Loredana Bianconi","original_name":"Loredana Bianconi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623792d21c635b001b97a8f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6864028","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
