He contacted Arhoolie Records founder Chris Strachwitz, who jumped at the chance to join him and share his enthusiasm for regional musical traditions. Wawzyn made three films dealing with blues, gospel, and hillbilly music. The negatives to those films were lost. This film recreates the journey from the best elements still available and includes much previously unreleased footage.","popularity":0.2501,"poster_path":"/pFZONoPgtrzjCKeYWs7O7toxIKy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Down Home Music - A Journey Through the Heartland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3430968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse Fuller","original_name":"Jesse Fuller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nwvQT5KldCW5mCgC9Blyw8dPPqR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"623680bf283ed9001b8e02d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lightnin' Hopkins","original_name":"Lightnin' Hopkins","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/A72x68WgYHPecKsv2CvTpLDaoie.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"623680cc34e152007344f8ea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3472126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lowell Fulson","original_name":"Lowell Fulson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"623680d8df29450019dd1a58","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3472127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Red Sovine","original_name":"Red Sovine","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"623680e8209f18001b5d019a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3472129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"King Louis H.
