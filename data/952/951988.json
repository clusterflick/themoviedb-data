Whether it is Naled sprayed on Miami residents for the War on Zika, or the neurotoxin Agent Orange sprayed over the Vietcong in the War on Vietnam, or the release of GMO mosquitoes over Brazilians with pyriproxyfen added to their drinking water in the War on Dengue, what are the results for nature and humanity?  Sprayed brings the viewer to the Vietnamese detoxification and rehabilitation centers to meet Agent Orange survivors, parents of babies born with microcephaly that triggered the global response to Zika, and to sprayed Florida residents.  Perspectives of doctors, scientists, and politicians are balanced with voices of ordinary citizens and victims to explore their concerns about the potential impact on future generations.","popularity":0.0729,"poster_path":"/bSuCpg9LkchpHcuOKX0ALU7Sw5M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What Can Go Wrong, Will.","title":"Sprayed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1933650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isazaly Mohd Isa","original_name":"Isazaly Mohd Isa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/uw80aAkYQ2MXLMTaO9swpdVAcsS.jpg","credit_id":"6237c6ac54a8ac0046dffee7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Pires","original_name":"Rafael Pires","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6237c78434e152001cd04642","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Pires","original_name":"Rafael Pires","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6237c5fd2efe4e00456bfdf3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1933650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isazaly Mohd Isa","original_name":"Isazaly Mohd Isa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/uw80aAkYQ2MXLMTaO9swpdVAcsS.jpg","credit_id":"6237c5bee3fa2f001b5cb28e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3473890,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig Leon","original_name":"Craig Leon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6237c26489f749001c41338f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3473920,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander Leon","original_name":"Alexander Leon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6237c689f3b49a007dd2b0ae","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7250206","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bSuCpg9LkchpHcuOKX0ALU7Sw5M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SPRAYED - a documentary by Craig Leon (Trailer)","key":"229444422","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-08-13T06:59:47.000Z","id":"6237c4ab0752880072fc09f7"}]}}}
