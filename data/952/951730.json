The daughter Ania and her mother have opposing worldviews. Their intense conversation takes place on the eve of Easter. Ania tries to follow own moral compass and defends herself from the mother's religious pressure. However, mother obsessively forces Anna to go to the church on a day of Christ rise. Moreover, mother hears the voice of only her own faith, but doesn't hear the voice of her daughter. It seems, some word - and they will lose one another forever... Likely, just the ordinary human love between them can return the mutual understanding of the daughter with her mother.","popularity":0.1221,"poster_path":"/xBcJPjLhl06Oq0GF5j76p55QNG0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2016-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Easter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3472824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svitlana Grigorenko","original_name":"Svitlana Grigorenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62373740df29450046080ccb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3472824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svitlana Grigorenko","original_name":"Svitlana Grigorenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6237374981c7be00760ddc73","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serhii Bukovskyi","original_name":"Сергій Буковський","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/4XfQBMFsLR7lBMof8rkPf3RzOQX.jpg","credit_id":"623737708ac3d0001bbaf535","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3472824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svitlana Grigorenko","original_name":"Svitlana Grigorenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623737550752880072f8ef23","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3472824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svitlana Grigorenko","original_name":"Svitlana Grigorenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6237375e075288001c5da93a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3472826,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Svitlana Zaloga","original_name":"Svitlana Zaloga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6237378534e15200462259b0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18933754","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/xBcJPjLhl06Oq0GF5j76p55QNG0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA International Documentary Human Rights Film Festival (informal date)","release_date":"2016-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DOCU/UKRAINE COMPETITION 2016: На Великдень","key":"LU6A1gOVfPY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-03-21T23:23:15.000Z","id":"62373704209f180072d5dc8a"}]}}}
