The two main means of testing materials are outdoor exposure racks and accelerated laboratory chambers. The xenon lamps used in sunlight weathering machines are said to have the power of two or three suns.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3D1iWVpWYHvDQQ8KcbvCKPejIFm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Power of Two or Three Suns","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yto Barrada","original_name":"Yto Barrada","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62360639209f18001b5b1a27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3D1iWVpWYHvDQQ8KcbvCKPejIFm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
