Said falls in with a group of old men looking for their bombed-out village; he offers to guide them, and takes as his wife Halaleh, the clan's lone woman, a widow with a young son. Reeboir attaches himself to a dozen pre-teen boys weighed down by contraband they carry across the border; they're mules, always on the move. Said and Reeboir try to teach as their potential students keep walking. Danger is close; armed soldiers patrol the skies, the roads, and the border. Is there a role for a teacher? Is there hope?","popularity":0.8319,"poster_path":"/ApLKw8jjGTp7M4FbivX3mHXJ6da.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54378,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fabrica","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":13518,"logo_path":"/4k4pfsETuAGPlmJ3yLkiTmOi9v1.png","name":"Makhmalbaf
