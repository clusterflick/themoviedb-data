Bockerer and his wife Binerl have survived the war, though his butcher's shop was destroyed by bombs. Karl Bockerer opens up a new establishment in the center of the city.  Post-war Vienna is divided into four zones in which the Allies run things and ensure that law and order prevails. This is the story of two lovers: Gustl, just returned form a POW camp, and the Russian interpreter Elena. Bockerer becomes the patron of their love. Elena's father was executed by Stalin, and the only way she can escape a similar fate is to marry an Austrian. Bockerer \"buys\" a husband for Elena and, full of tricks as ever, he succeeds in pulling the wool over the Russian occupier's eyes.","popularity":0.3236,"poster_path":"/2cI9w0q9PKwaNfTfIeRUYCyXlkE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1833,"logo_path":"/6Ot5X5xRv0PvZ9cUUD5ZymSruLi.png","name":"Epo-Film","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":1541,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terra Film Group","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1996-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Bockerer II - Österreich ist frei","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Merkatz","original_name":"Karl Merkatz","popularity":0.1357,"profile_path":"/jjptw1vcpqVYaDqgkgtZapQ7w3v.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Karl Bockerer","credit_id":"52fe4599c3a368484e0643e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Vasicek","original_name":"Caroline Vasicek","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/iQXUNNOzfcZYasGMt1rOwfKYoe2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elena Kolotschewa","credit_id":"52fe4599c3a368484e0643e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Wussow","original_name":"Alexander Wussow","popularity":0.0951,"profile_path":"/A5a1puYv9tuUBToowjLEK5D0Rq0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gustl Bühringer","credit_id":"52fe4599c3a368484e0643e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ida Krottendorf","original_name":"Ida Krottendorf","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/wd4vmDPaY6HdfKueG2hyyRYFvKC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sabine (Binerl) Bockerer","credit_id":"52fe4599c3a368484e0643ed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Petters","original_name":"Heinz Petters","popularity":0.2051,"profile_path":"/bfxkQknfjGupb3X7lDJsa5Z9Vrx.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"Franz Hatzinger","credit_id":"61b3a57b223e200042a4c0ca","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Schottenberg","original_name":"Michael Schottenberg","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/rhigMoVMTGg6ovEpSEEBSRZvPfN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gstettner","credit_id":"52fe4599c3a368484e0643f1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Marecek","original_name":"Heinz Marecek","popularity":0.1957,"profile_path":"/lhQrB1b6ruM5CjT5NLaoxnWFOP3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sg.
