Delahoussaye) returns to Miami to reopen his grandfather's defunct catering company. This arouses the interest of the local sheriff (Mark McLachlan), who holds Fuad's family reputation in ill favor. Fuad is soon, however, asked to cater the sheriff's wedding by his mother-in-law, Mrs. Lamply (Melissa Morgan), and fiancee, Tiffani (Toni Winne). After finding his grandfather's statue of Ishtar, an Egyptian goddess, in a utility closet, he becomes possessed by her evil spirit. He then goes on to create the 'blood feast' his grandfather failed to do, by killing young women in the area and making them into party food for the wedding.","popularity":0.6211,"poster_path":"/fIQP3OKFAMQUcDPehB1BTihIwgU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":32,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Blood Feast 2: Buffet of Blood","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John McConnell","original_name":"John McConnell","popularity":0.2263,"profile_path":"/gAHxNx9PhT2xVqct6ac61tKFabT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Detective Dave Loomis","credit_id":"52fe457ec3a368484e05e933","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark McLachlan","original_name":"Mark McLachlan","popularity":0.1486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Detective Mike Myers","credit_id":"52fe457ec3a368484e05e937","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":99931,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Melissa Morgan","original_name":"Melissa Morgan","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Lampley","credit_id":"52fe457ec3a368484e05e93b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Wynne","original_name":"Toni Wynne","popularity":0.2069,"profile_path":"/q6v54Q6AZXukRX0PHh0O1p758ER.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tiffani Lampley","credit_id":"52fe457ec3a368484e05e93f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":99933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.P.
