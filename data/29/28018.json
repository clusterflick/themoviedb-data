The two contrarians laugh, confide and argue, in public and in private, as they journey through three cities. And the film captures it all. The result is a magnetic conflict, a character-driven narrative that sparkles cinematically with a perfect match of arresting personalities and intellectual rivalry. COLLISION is directed by prolific independent filmmaker Darren Doane (Van Morrison: Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl, The Battle For L.A., Godmoney).","popularity":0.4784,"poster_path":"/3IxTKqBTMDb4lmVbFEqt4m5jHWn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4738,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crux Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is Christianity Good For The World?","title":"Collision","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Wilson","original_name":"Douglas Wilson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4573c3a368484e05bd0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Hitchens","original_name":"Christopher Hitchens","popularity":0.1508,"profile_path":"/ntK4rpy6Y0I6bicILVC6ZkIa7d5.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4573c3a368484e05bd13","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":99391,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Josh Karchmer","original_name":"Josh Karchmer","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4573c3a368484e05bcdb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":99392,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aaron Rench","original_name":"Aaron Rench","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4573c3a368484e05bce1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":99396,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Aaron Flynn","original_name":"Aaron Flynn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4573c3a368484e05bcf9","department":"Crew","job":"Second Unit"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":99399,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Billy Maddox II","original_name":"Billy Maddox II","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4573c3a368484e05bd0b","department":"Crew","job":"Post Production Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":99393,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nathan D.
