On the night of February 20th, 2003...  America’s deadliest rock concert began in West Warwick, Rhode Island, when the band Great White ignited pyrotechnics inside a run-down roadhouse called the station.  The resulting conflagration killed 100 persons and grievously injured many others.  It could fairly be said that music and rock culture drew one hundred innocent people to their deaths in the Station Fire.  The Guest List explores how that same music and culture became sources of healing and comfort, at least for some, in the years thereafter.","popularity":0.4156,"poster_path":"/aoZrVG9lDYPlEWPdZG0r6AYEdST.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The untold story of America's deadliest rock concert.","title":"The Guest List","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dee Snider","original_name":"Dee Snider","popularity":0.3803,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6396733c7304b500b860757c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1842534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Dokken","original_name":"Don Dokken","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/282Btv7xJT4owQ02aOueGzmWhfj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63967360a1a9ba007df8daef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3826757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Biechele","original_name":"Daniel Biechele","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6396736e2cefc20084b522ab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":950346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lita Ford","original_name":"Lita Ford","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/truEQDacz0DzU9u0mtam3kpiJDG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6396737d8a88b200a7648277","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114595,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David S.
