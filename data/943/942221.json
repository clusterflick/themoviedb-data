But on their way home from work, they run over a kitten. A high school girl and her friend start digging a cat's grave in an empty lot. Meanwhile, in the park, a group of young lovers are worried about the disappearance of a cat with the strange name of \"common sense and common sense of the street\". A midsummer day called today lies between yesterday and tomorrow. The story is an omnibus of three stories about people who are a little bit different from each other. The stylish black-and-white imagery, like a, peek into the world of fables, is strangely matched by the droll dialogue. The smooth development from one episode to the next, and the urban sense of the three pairs of characters, two of whom seem unlikely to exist, shine through.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/itdfamffB1GrOpbFJTRA92Qc5aK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Dead Days","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroshi Yoshimatsu","original_name":"Hiroshi Yoshimatsu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"621531a30cd4460069300c1a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuko Fukudome","original_name":"Yuko Fukudome","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"621531aa4dc34a0042b7e6c9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chisa Nishida","original_name":"Chisa Nishida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"621531b10b5fd6001b2c301e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sachie Yasuda","original_name":"Sachie Yasuda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"621531b71a3248004457c572","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masato Kouatsu","original_name":"Masato Kouatsu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"621531c1813831006e13ec35","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshimi Arai","original_name":"Yoshimi Arai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"621531ca0e4fc80044110998","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noboru Ojiro","original_name":"Noboru Ojiro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621531818138310042d9c7d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noboru Ojiro","original_name":"Noboru Ojiro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6215318bd3d38700427ceedf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noboru Ojiro","original_name":"Noboru Ojiro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6215318f383df20042478835","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noboru Ojiro","original_name":"Noboru Ojiro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6215319644a4240046d3d8ec","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439049,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Tomokatsu Yamamoto","original_name":"Tomokatsu Yamamoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621531e21a3248004457c640","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439050,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shinji Yamashita","original_name":"Shinji Yamashita","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621532010bb076006b75590c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439052,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hiroyuki Takayama","original_name":"Hiroyuki Takayama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621532094284ea0068bf5733","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3458896,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Kenji Yasuda","original_name":"Kenji Yasuda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228bbf71bf26600667d2448","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3557840,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Takeru Sato","original_name":"Takeru Sato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62883ce7d43f010052d8fe9d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/itdfamffB1GrOpbFJTRA92Qc5aK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
