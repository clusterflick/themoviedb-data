Войне и смерти вопреки","overview":"This is an unthinkable story about mercy. About Elizabeth Glinka and her followers. About the humanitarian mission of the charity organization “Doctor Lisa's Fair Help\" in the Donbas. About the readiness to rush to the rescue at any time of the day or night, to any point of the earth. Despite the war, despite the closed borders. This is a movie about the fact that there are no other people's children. That every child's life is priceless. About how important it is to help, protect, protect everyone who needs, here and now.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live!
