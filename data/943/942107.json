Three Filipino warriors fought against the oppression of the Spanish regime in the late 19th century. They come from different backgrounds- a man from a line of chieftains conquered centuries ago; a woman with the conquerorâ€™s blood in her veins rejected by her family of privilege; and a young man from a land across the sea fighting for his new home. Now the three find themselves in a new time. A time where the Philippines is a free nation. A time when the Philippines is as enslaved as ever. Their eyes have seen oppression. They still see it and they act in the only way they can. They fight.","popularity":0.0486,"poster_path":"/8blqprI2ugMAvmsJW9C7PyFrkxV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2015-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lakas ng Lahi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnold Arre","original_name":"Arnold Arre","popularity":0.1596,"profile_path":"/gX3c4PomXvJYaKPLWoPcehW1GmO.jpg","credit_id":"6214c4ef0cd44600442511e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438512,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cynthia Arre","original_name":"Cynthia Arre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6214c5700cd44600692eec7e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnold Arre","original_name":"Arnold Arre","popularity":0.1596,"profile_path":"/gX3c4PomXvJYaKPLWoPcehW1GmO.jpg","credit_id":"6214c536d3d38700427bbd06","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438511,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emil Flores","original_name":"Emil Flores","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6214c5509f5dfb00414c327a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438514,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neva Kares Talladen","original_name":"Neva Kares Talladen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6214c6564284ea0068be2bf2","department":"Writing","job":"Other"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8blqprI2ugMAvmsJW9C7PyFrkxV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
