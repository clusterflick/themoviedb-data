This is the voiceover over Kazuko's crying figure in the meadow. The voice is that of Haruko, Kazuko's best friend who is in a sanatorium. When Kazuko went to visit her, she was told to \"imagine\" her wrapped in a flower. On her way home, when she is followed in the forest by her classmate Yamada-Kun, Kazuko sees herself wrapped in a flower this time, while climbing a tree branch. With these strange thoughts in her mind, Kazuko arrives in a strange town. She smokes in an incinerator with her new friends and falls in love with the place. One day, on a bicycle trip, she discovers that the sanatorium she had missed is no longer there. There is only a vacant lot. Kazuko crouched there and wept.  It was the seventh day after Haruko's death.  The transience of memory and the sadness of forgetting. A fantasy of flowers and greenery, with a touch of fantasy that visualises the sadness of fading memories.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oAWprVifYg9ZppMGu4eVNpilJeL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"煙之花　花之煙","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ishiyama Miyuki","original_name":"Ishiyama Miyuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6217737b3a9937006cc679ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inoue Katsumi","original_name":"Inoue Katsumi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"621773808d2f8d006a6b1f72","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hori Kyoko","original_name":"Hori Kyoko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"621773967fcab30042c804ac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kitayama Mikiko","original_name":"Kitayama Mikiko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6217739c3d4d96004103d3cf","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359279,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenji Yoshinaga","original_name":"Kenji Yoshinaga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62177361d14443006532a53e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshiyuki Shariki","original_name":"Yoshiyuki Shariki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62177357a6d931001b5674bf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441758,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hideto Konishi","original_name":"Hideto Konishi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62177371cb8028004298d820","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshiyuki Shariki","original_name":"Yoshiyuki Shariki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621773503d4d96001a2ee82f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshiyuki Shariki","original_name":"Yoshiyuki Shariki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217732c5be00e004209963d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshiyuki Shariki","original_name":"Yoshiyuki Shariki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621773498d2f8d001bf7fb56","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oAWprVifYg9ZppMGu4eVNpilJeL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
