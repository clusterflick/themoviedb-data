Here, they recognize behavior once thought to be beyond eccentric, yet today somehow normalized - perhaps sprouting from a modern culture of self-centered ideology? We witness in this character the downfall of self-idolatry; the frequent cause and occasional side effect of pathological narcissism; self-hatred. The struggle between loving oneself more than anything, while simultaneously desiring perfection, threatens to upend the film's eerie dreamworld. However, a brief brush with self-awareness only serves to solidify the character's self-obsession. An existential crisis half-realized - drowned in the shallow waters of Narcissus' well.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/fehvXsVq3mZIBhdByA5cuCfBVNA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Encore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Smith","original_name":"Cameron Smith","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"621471611a3248006abbc28f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3437372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lang","original_name":"Robert Lang","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621471880929f60069af0c4a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3437372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lang","original_name":"Robert Lang","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6214722fb84cdd00434c5107","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3437372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lang","original_name":"Robert Lang","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621471a8c9044c0068ac3800","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437381,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Lang","original_name":"Robert Lang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621471cb0b5fd6001b2a9e42","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3437372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lang","original_name":"Robert Lang","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6214717496670e001be9dfdb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8093226","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2102,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fehvXsVq3mZIBhdByA5cuCfBVNA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
