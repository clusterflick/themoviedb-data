It’s Belfast - early 70’s… BOOM! Something’s in the air and it’s not a bomb, it’s a revolution. Glam Rock is drowning out the noise of armoured cars. As British soldiers patrol the streets, kids are glued to Top Of The Pops, entranced by Marc Bolan, the androgynous, satin-clad, glitter-god.  In a high-rise flat lives a recently bereaved father and his ten-year-old son PJ, who is desperate to get his hands on the new T. Rex album Electric Warrior. The problem is he’s skint and his Da is on the dole. PJ comes up with a cunning plan to get the dough, involving a sock, a prosthetic leg and a pawnbroker.  Ruthless is a humorous, heartwarming story of how a prosthetic leg and a T. Rex album become the conduit for overcoming grief.","popularity":0.3571,"poster_path":"/h3DH3T0HNkDF6cR91GDKH0bPRN9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Northern Star Pictures","origin_country":"XI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2021-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruthless","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Harden","original_name":"Jonathan Harden","popularity":0.2669,"profile_path":"/otQwnW5jAiAINclxzkp3JS05Hqu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6216c2183a9937006cc492b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie McCafferty","original_name":"Frankie McCafferty","popularity":0.3742,"profile_path":"/qO12dRPtuXXX40Eab3QrliAsnz8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6216c222d14443006530d2c6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Lowey","original_name":"Jay Lowey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6216c22ca885870042128644","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew McGuigan","original_name":"Matthew McGuigan","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6216c25f88bbe6004273fdad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1789458,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leo McGuigan","original_name":"Leo McGuigan","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/rCUseyEtqiBxHj6YgimsTJ73JaM.jpg","credit_id":"6216c287abdafc006c7920bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1789407,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adam O'Dwyer","original_name":"Adam O'Dwyer","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/yB5eIfKUI4xxSrGIqsawzva2Khp.jpg","credit_id":"6216c2c78d2f8d001bf64cbf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1768438,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul McGuigan","original_name":"Paul McGuigan","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/d8KhBMNaeCYnJk2xc0khAknlNpY.jpg","credit_id":"6216c299a6d9310043cae3d1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441062,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kate Perry","original_name":"Kate Perry","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6216c26e7fcab3001c0e1171","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2681348,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aidan Gault","original_name":"Aidan Gault","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65766914a84a472de6ebac7b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15303584","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h3DH3T0HNkDF6cR91GDKH0bPRN9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Galway Film Fleadh","release_date":"2021-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
