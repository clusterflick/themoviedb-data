He was then 26 years old. Two decades later, the enfant terrible of hardcore (now also popular in the techno sphere) and the ravers of the Breton point form an inseparable family. Christophe Lévêque, the hedonistic owner of the castle, continues to welcome them every year. To retrace the history of Manu Le Malin, we gathered in Keriolet those who have been with him during these two decades. A family reunion in \"Snow White's castle on acid\", to tell the story of this strange night bird that only the light of day can stop.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/iPye97U8uIQVsweJ4awthR6CSQU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sous le donjon de Manu le Malin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6596552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":779,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iPye97U8uIQVsweJ4awthR6CSQU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":544}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
