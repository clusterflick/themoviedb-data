Revealing the ongoing dangers for women reporters, and the extraordinary risks they take, this brave film provides an in-depth look into Zan TV, Kabul’s female-led news agency. A professional journalist herself, Ahmed documents both the harrowing and inspiring work of young, female journalists over the course of the two-year lead up to the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. Following parallel news stories as they unfold – two sets of national elections as well as ongoing U.S.-Taliban peace talks – the film reveals the daily hurdles Afghan female reporters and media staff face, underscoring the existential current events that threaten both Zan TV as a media outlet and the livelihoods of the women at its heart.","popularity":0.758,"poster_path":"/jcPxo1t3v9ei2IzX4dpGfGXX4Lc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In
