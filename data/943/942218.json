One of them eventually reaches the nucleus inside and begins to divide. The rapidly expanding nucleus soon takes on the shape of a baby. Today, the electronic society is expanding at a furious pace. It is the energy that is essential for the development of human society, but what will happen to the relationship between the two when they continue their rapid expansion? Plastic cards and IC chips are used symbolically to create realistic and detailed human beings. This is a grotesquely powerful image of the Metamorphosis, created with great imagination and formative power. A clay animation with a dry message condensed into four minutes.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/uuwlwiWs0PN9p91rDDEGrQmzj0u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biomimetic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nori Shimonishi","original_name":"Nori Shimonishi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6215304b813831001c65cba8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nori Shimonishi","original_name":"Nori Shimonishi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6215305044a424006c6f630d","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nori Shimonishi","original_name":"Nori Shimonishi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621530461a3248006abd594a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nori Shimonishi","original_name":"Nori Shimonishi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621530564284ea0068bf50f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uuwlwiWs0PN9p91rDDEGrQmzj0u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
