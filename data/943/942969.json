Carrying a video camera, the protagonist visits his old friends to find out what happened to OGATA. It seems as if his purpose is to go around declaring that he is looking for OGATA (who everyone wants to see). His friends are disgusted and tell him to \"grow up\". Eventually, the protagonist finds out that OGATA is in Kyushu and goes to see him with his camera. Seeing him for the first time in a long time, OGATA begins to talk about the reasons for his disappearance and his current life. This is a story of self-discovery through the act of searching for a friend. The film is as close to a documentary as possible, but it skillfully approaches the psychological structure of the protagonist, a moratorium man.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rsmDFENDEXuyRJsjvfAjWI7p6pc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"OGATAを捜す'92","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ota Shinichi","original_name":"Ota Shinichi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62177470ce5d8200410e213b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Higashi Kazufumi","original_name":"Higashi Kazufumi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6217747b8d2f8d006a6b2103","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iwakiri Shoji","original_name":"Iwakiri Shoji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"621774853d4d96001a2ee978","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ogata Katsutoshi","original_name":"Ogata Katsutoshi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6217748b0e597b001b9a76f8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ota Shinichi","original_name":"Ota Shinichi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62177442cb8028001baab8e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ota Shinichi","original_name":"Ota Shinichi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217744dafa1b000456294dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ota Shinichi","original_name":"Ota Shinichi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217745254f6eb001b76ab6d","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ota Shinichi","original_name":"Ota Shinichi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62177499a27502006d720e62","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iwakiri Shoji","original_name":"Iwakiri Shoji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621774a1a27502001b66d4e3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441771,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kai Tomio","original_name":"Kai Tomio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621774ab0e597b00691cc072","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rsmDFENDEXuyRJsjvfAjWI7p6pc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
