This man talks to his dead Father.  Conversations with my dead Father is an episode in the life of someone who lost their father but wants to continue the conversations. It's a film about remembering memories, some bitter, some sweet, it's about fights, diets, it's about missing the ones you love, it's about not letting go, it's about everyday chats. It's about life.","popularity":0.127,"poster_path":"/kpShwCjBGz0yomG5MFYG0LkRREU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170460,"logo_path":null,"name":"ORion Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conversations With My Dead Father","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ciaran Bermingham","original_name":"Ciaran Bermingham","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/mBjlJdldAuQDoHUhJmt8SibgyA4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6216bfa1a88587001be9e063","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1981705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sinead O'Riordan","original_name":"Sinead O'Riordan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6216bfafcb80280065f7d4ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Murphy","original_name":"Gary Murphy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6216bfbda88587006ccf9b38","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762250,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maurice O'Carroll","original_name":"Maurice O'Carroll","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6216c05bce5d82001b3c49b8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ciaran Bermingham","original_name":"Ciaran Bermingham","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/mBjlJdldAuQDoHUhJmt8SibgyA4.jpg","credit_id":"6216c08267e0f7001ba53e6d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1981705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sinead O'Riordan","original_name":"Sinead O'Riordan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6216c0910e597b00691af76a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762250,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maurice O'Carroll","original_name":"Maurice O'Carroll","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6216c06da14e1000633ac101","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441054,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Joe Mahon","original_name":"Joe Mahon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6216c0453a9937006cc48b4b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15323598","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kpShwCjBGz0yomG5MFYG0LkRREU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Cork International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
