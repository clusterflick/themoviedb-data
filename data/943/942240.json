All he had to do was go to a poet's house and listen to his poems. On the day of the job, the poet, Kihara, reads out a strange poem that starts with \"The world is one\" and ends with \"Because we are 10 years old\". Yazawa did as Kihara asked, reciting the poem and answering his questions. Yazawa reads the poem at Kihara's request and asks him a question: \"Please give me a title. Kihara's ability to take something that would normally be \"boring\" and turn it into a surrealistic laugh is brilliant.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/4T3yPMwPvw1dzg7s1eHdxj1pg9Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nonsensical Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masahiko Nakawa","original_name":"Masahiko Nakawa","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"621536860e4fc80044111b36","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noriko Kikuchi","original_name":"Noriko Kikuchi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6215368c63d713004412c188","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3432633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kihara Minoru","original_name":"Kihara Minoru","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"621536931a3248001c4d6f8b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3432713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yazawa Tadashi","original_name":"Yazawa Tadashi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6215369cdfe31d00423952af","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1735410,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Masahito Kagawa","original_name":"香川まさひと","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6215366d9f5dfb001b32fcb3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1735410,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Masahito Kagawa","original_name":"香川まさひと","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621536680cd4460044264603","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1735410,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Masahito Kagawa","original_name":"香川まさひと","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621536631a3248006abd6dc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1735410,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Masahito Kagawa","original_name":"香川まさひと","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62153674813831006e13fce3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439115,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yasumi Inoue","original_name":"Yasumi Inoue","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6215367f0b5fd600690ef378","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4T3yPMwPvw1dzg7s1eHdxj1pg9Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
