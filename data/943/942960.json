The protagonist is a friend of the director Kudo. His parents divorced when he was a child and he has grown up in an environment that is too miserable to be described in one word: gloomy. The film exposes all the privacy of his family. His father abandoned him and his mother and evaporated. A mother who brought her lover into the house. What were they thinking at the time when I felt so alone? To find out, he goes to his father's home, where he has remarried and has a child, and to his mother, who works hard to send him money. The camera follows the process closely and captures the naked truth on film. The director Kudo and the protagonist, in collusion to break the taboo, are on the edge of their seats in front of and behind the camera. The energy that surges through them is a truth that can only be expressed through the documentary method.","popularity":0.058,"poster_path":"/xLHYdbd5TG4h46CgGOYvRDh8dsV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"家族ケチャップ","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2212288,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Isamu Fujii","original_name":"藤井勇","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62176ff37fcab30042c7ff69","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441728,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Nakahara Kiyoko","original_name":"Nakahara Kiyoko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62176ffc88bbe6006be7eb5c","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441733,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ogawa Koji","original_name":"Ogawa Koji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217703b3a99370042e5229a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshihiro Kudo","original_name":"Yoshihiro Kudo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217702354f6eb001b76a6c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441727,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chuda Ryuzo","original_name":"Chuda Ryuzo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62176fe7a6d9310043ccbba6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshihiro Kudo","original_name":"Yoshihiro Kudo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62177030a27502006d7208db","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xLHYdbd5TG4h46CgGOYvRDh8dsV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
