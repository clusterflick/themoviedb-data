This psychologically complex yet subtle story brings us into post-recession rural Ireland. A community has turned its back on who they believe is a perpetrator rather than a victim. Steven has done time for the incident, and can’t find a way to reconcile himself to his new life. He turns to his dead girlfriend’s mother for solace, and a strange relationship unfolds.","popularity":0.1996,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":170462,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Rose Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Passion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2625340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Blake","original_name":"Frank Blake","popularity":0.2207,"profile_path":"/vapsLZpKx7Y2gPt3XQNRswJZfc5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6216c52aa2d2e9007075d75d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Wehrly","original_name":"Olga Wehrly","popularity":0.1335,"profile_path":"/i29Pbmu1EHnkvNDf5CButBTI5sG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6216c53579a1c30043f5156c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":995518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Bennett","original_name":"Andrew Bennett","popularity":0.1501,"profile_path":"/wf0VuQCjD1RU3OtBt111afthIRo.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6602cd73197de401861caeb8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1521216,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Luke Jacobs","original_name":"Luke Jacobs","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6216c61fa14e10001c030ee5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2625340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Blake","original_name":"Frank Blake","popularity":0.2207,"profile_path":"/vapsLZpKx7Y2gPt3XQNRswJZfc5.jpg","credit_id":"6216c873a88587004212a0d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Mullarkey","original_name":"Mia Mullarkey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6216c582a27502006d7048a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Mullarkey","original_name":"Mia Mullarkey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6216c64d0e597b001b98b54e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3235061,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roisin Geraghty","original_name":"Roisin Geraghty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6216c5a5a2750200426e753b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15113522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Galway Film Fleadh","release_date":"2021-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Passion Trailer","key":"549347826","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-05-14T16:12:45.000Z","id":"6216c96ece5d820069220f20"}]}}}
