It takes place at Jounenji Temple in Kyoto, Japan. The son of the priest spends his day in a daze, doing nothing. The only one who comes to see him is an older man who likes to drink. The season passes quietly as the two drink together... Spring with its greenery, summer with its festival music, autumn with its moonlight, winter with its snow. The film is a visual poem that depicts the passage of time, incorporating seasonal scenes. The depth of the picture created by the precise framing, the fixed camera that captures the subtle changes in the wind and light, and the sound recording that even captures the rustling of the leaves, all combine to create a \"drama\" that can only be described as cinematic.","popularity":0.056,"poster_path":"/sQ2EMkvOaykoq5EW8yZQCcMS3hb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"蝸牛庵の夜","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yokota Masako","original_name":"Yokota Masako","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62177535a88587004214a0b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ohara Kazuhito","original_name":"Ohara Kazuhito","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6217753b0e597b001b9a77d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yokota Kanesho","original_name":"Yokota Kanesho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6217754b3d4d96004103d600","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ogitani Yasunobu","original_name":"Ogitani Yasunobu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"62177553d14443006532a79e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takemi Yokota","original_name":"Takemi Yokota","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621774fbce5d8200410e21f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takemi Yokota","original_name":"Takemi Yokota","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621774ff7fcab3001c0fa949","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takemi Yokota","original_name":"Takemi Yokota","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621775058d2f8d006a6b221b","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takemi Yokota","original_name":"Takemi Yokota","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217750ba275020042704b28","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441773,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Seikosomi Hirofumi","original_name":"Seikosomi Hirofumi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62177514d14443006532a772","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sQ2EMkvOaykoq5EW8yZQCcMS3hb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
