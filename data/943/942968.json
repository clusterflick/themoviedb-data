The story takes place in the house where the old man lives. When the old man gets out of the bath and goes down the spiral staircase, a young man in a bathrobe suddenly appears, ranting loudly about something. Surprised, the old man goes after him and finds the young man in the cellar struggling with another man. The man's head falls and rolls. From then on, a dizzying world of images unfolds in rapid succession, the space becomes cosmic, and various objects begin to float.  As the artist himself says, \"I created this work as a single image\", and it is perhaps best to let the flow of images unfold in front of you, rather than trying to read some kind of narrative. The dolls are grotesquely detailed, the sets like works of art. The props and objects have a natural texture. It is a work of such a high standard that anyone who hears that it took three years to make will nod their head in agreement.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xxpe03FjRrKO89iHJCgyIuPHqYQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PARALYSIS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Tokuyama","original_name":"Takashi Tokuyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621773edd144430043f47b71","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Tokuyama","original_name":"Takashi Tokuyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621773e27fcab30042c8055a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Tokuyama","original_name":"Takashi Tokuyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621773b8a6d931001b56755c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Tokuyama","original_name":"Takashi Tokuyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621773e75be00e004209977a","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Motoko","original_name":"Motoko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621773d8cb8028004298d90b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Motoko","original_name":"Motoko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621773c2a6d931006b27f476","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Motoko","original_name":"Motoko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621773d18d2f8d006a6b1fb9","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Motoko","original_name":"Motoko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621773cca6d931001b567564","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xxpe03FjRrKO89iHJCgyIuPHqYQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
