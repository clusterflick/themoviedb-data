In finding that associate eviscerated on a riverbank, Frank begins investigating the murder. When his informants Charlie, Sam, and Jonathan have nothing to offer, Frank finds that he himself has become the new target of his associates' assassins. After being jumped in an alley and injected with a virus, Frank's body begins to transform. The closer Frank comes to the truth...the less there is left of Franks's physical being.
