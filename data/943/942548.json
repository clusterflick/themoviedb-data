Reared in an atmosphere of strictness and seclusion, Dolores is possessed with a desire to see the world, and after meeting Lawrence Grant, a politician's son, her curiosity is aroused even more and she escapes from the convent. Found on the road by Kale's friends, Dolores lives in his home for a time, but later, Lawrence takes her under his wing with the intention of marrying her. Although she loves Lawrence, Dolores misses Kale's parties and returns to him, whereupon Kale threatens to publicize her activities unless Lawrence's father agrees to his demands. Lawrence takes a repentant Dolores away from one of Kale's riotous parties, but after Kale is found dead, Lawrence is arrested for murder.","popularity":0.2106,"poster_path":"/kOrMqvB98PDXoqvPaPGjK7VhVbA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miss Innocence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2388275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Caprice","original_name":"June Caprice","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/86le24kmVzD6IJGvovQxo4oV9fz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dolores May","credit_id":"6216466a0b5fd6001b2f36c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1282412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Shotwell","original_name":"Marie Shotwell","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/elyNLAoMoKBN685juSnMZbeF5Bm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Fay Gonard","credit_id":"6216467e1a3248001c504e25","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Walker","original_name":"Bob Walker","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":"/a7QWDqRgmbdCkm2BVhmjFGqrUL8.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Henry Grant / Lawrence Grant","credit_id":"621646909ba86a0067c4379c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Beamish","original_name":"Frank Beamish","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Kale Loomis","credit_id":"621646a1dfe31d006e3ff8c1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1458168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carleton Macy","original_name":"Carleton Macy","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"James Boyle","credit_id":"621646b13f48330044782f7c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Garrison","original_name":"Elizabeth Garrison","popularity":0.0473,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Grant","credit_id":"621646c39ba86a0067c4384f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2853084,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas F.
