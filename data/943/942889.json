From its stationary position, the camera records the slow entrance and exit of several figures exploring the rocky shore flashlights in hand. The rhythmic pacing of their explorations reveal a considered yet organic choreography of bodies slowly moving in and out of frame in the liminal space where land meets water, where day meets night, where earth meets stars. EVENTIDE, like much of Lockhartâ€™s work, invites contemplation, asks us to consider what we see and hear. The film has a solemn, almost dreamlike quality, one heightened by the night sky, the silhouettes searching in the dark, and the overwhelmingness of nature.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/dtv0OsIBjNFkYANYURARhwySJHa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EVENTIDE","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sharon Lockhart","original_name":"Sharon Lockhart","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/4Mjd7zbpBzuV7JPgCCu10Bf9pqM.jpg","credit_id":"62170abfd14443001bed6146","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2846036,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Simon Gulergun","original_name":"Simon Gulergun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632d12123e09f3007f13f8ab","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21651854","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2083,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dtv0OsIBjNFkYANYURARhwySJHa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1389},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/euftTxoH2PIqlFXm8oQIu1oCyTR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
