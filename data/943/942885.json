The exhibition consists of the titular multi-channel video projected and displayed on sculptural, kinetic screens alongside new drawings of scenes from the world of the CAPS. One screen, broadcasting what could be an A.I.-generated children’s video, is topped by helicoptering ropes that slap the gallery walls. Inspired by the compilation structure and synesthetic drive of Disney’s Fantasia (1940), Guided Tour of a Spill centers less on overt narrative and more on the visceral and sensorial pleasure of music, dance, athletics and humor.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/8OK8HDzcSTnHZyifNmBXLMQtydj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guided Tour of a Spill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2440143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meriem Bennani","original_name":"Meriem Bennani","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/c6WoSlRITrcXPBNKSKAR51CfEHB.jpg","credit_id":"621706d20e597b00691c133a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1069,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8OK8HDzcSTnHZyifNmBXLMQtydj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":716}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
