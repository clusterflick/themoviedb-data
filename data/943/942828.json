Just like those silly boys who are desperate for love, Hai Bo clumsily but persistently pursues love with the help of his friends. He stood on the roof and made a loud confession, and his friends saw that the Christmas tree invited Xiaoqing to dance. Youth is beautiful but fleeting. When they finally come together, they gradually find that the romance of the past is slowly disappearing, and the cold reality makes each other appreciate the hardships and bitterness of life. Hai Bo recalled the dream wolf and impulse in his youth again and again and unconsciously split into a self who ran rampant in the underworld and dared to think and act, and a self who succumbed to reality and made compromises. Under Xiaoqing's cold gaze, the two Haibo started to fight for the long-awaited good life.","popularity":0.0925,"poster_path":"/2ZpynS7MuXiWc8NiBQc4O0lMjKT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2012-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christmas On The Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"There's a Christmas Tree on the Hill","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2311789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huang Haibo","original_name":"Huang Haibo","popularity":0.2082,"profile_path":"/b68pYw73bbe3MV3TTCCcTuvLV8i.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Haibo","credit_id":"6216d4205be00e006b37206f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tan Zhuo","original_name":"Tan Zhuo","popularity":0.4652,"profile_path":"/ojPyZhpVvxc0QmG8ABgb4HePAa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Xiaoqing","credit_id":"6216d432a2d2e9001d35522e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2476661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guo Yongzhen","original_name":"Guo Yongzhen","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":"/kJWEwCkwgGNCYDxSoq39RRfwGXk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6216d4458d2f8d00429c61cb","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Meng","original_name":"Zhang Meng","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/c69lcDcNk3X4aPJraYRvHoUAq4k.jpg","credit_id":"6216d93ca2d2e9001d356aa6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1005936,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeremy Zhou","original_name":"Jeremy Zhou","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/iCYq5SQYPe9kBUdknvG8uwYvUgp.jpg","credit_id":"6259c9a2c92c5d1968a0d6b0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Meng","original_name":"Zhang Meng","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/c69lcDcNk3X4aPJraYRvHoUAq4k.jpg","credit_id":"6672f9c14234e2d0e53467e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2ZpynS7MuXiWc8NiBQc4O0lMjKT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d4oXDZd02ZjW2Y6enem5BYqWX89.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
