These three gaijin fakirs ignore the rules and common sense of the world and put on a crazy performance. They are the young people of the end of the century who live in the mood of \"the world is going to be all right, it's only a paradise now\". They walk to the Kinkakuji Temple, the place of the last banquet, with the unmistakable presence of Japanese young people behind their cheap make-up. Taking photos with junior high school students on a school trip and avoiding real gaijin, their hymn to youth comes to an end... A funny and ultimately sad \"true story of stupid people\".","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yTt7gKyIr5IvqkwAVlVohfxn0FZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White, Black, Indian","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3417330,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tetsuo Ogawa","original_name":"Tetsuo Ogawa","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"621534020bb076001b02236c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fusako Kojima","original_name":"Fusako Kojima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6215340a0e4fc8006bbf24c0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyohei Ogawa","original_name":"Kyohei Ogawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6215340f4dc34a0069a74d2e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3417330,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tetsuo Ogawa","original_name":"Tetsuo Ogawa","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621533f5dfe31d004239473e","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hirohiko Tado","original_name":"Hirohiko Tado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62153369383df2001bcdc14c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3417330,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tetsuo Ogawa","original_name":"Tetsuo Ogawa","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621533fc0e4fc80044111110","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hirohiko Tado","original_name":"Hirohiko Tado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6215336e323eba006c612511","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hirohiko Tado","original_name":"Hirohiko Tado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621533610cd44600693010f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hirohiko Tado","original_name":"Hirohiko Tado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621534184284ea0040dd42b4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yTt7gKyIr5IvqkwAVlVohfxn0FZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
