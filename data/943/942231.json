Three stories about the limits human beings will go to in the simple attempt to be happy. Clotilde lives in number 24. She is an elderly lady and the sole responsible of her son, Javier, who is schizophrenic. But they have found an equilibrium to survive their misery. An equilibrium that may be broken at any time. Number 7 is home to Janet, a pregnant prostitute. She lives with Leslie, her junkie colleague. They know they have no future. But they have a plan. They need to go to Miami. The father of Janet's unborn child has the money they need. And they have decided to take the respect they are owed. Above the girls lives Fredy. He is in love with Álvaro, who has AIDS. Together they have established a shelter where people infected with HIV can find company. But Álvaro is dimming. Fredy won't accept it, but Alvaro has little time left. Three stories to continue sharing the same Condominium. ¿Where do YOU live?","popularity":0.1804,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2007-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Condominio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Élide Brero","original_name":"Élide Brero","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/yOLOjRtTMTGDhpos5cYq0aY3vTg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Clotilde","credit_id":"621530b54284ea0040dd356c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Ísola","original_name":"Alberto Ísola","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/daJqh7gcx0PpRXkApn2RmWQ1D9g.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Javier","credit_id":"621530d90cd44600693009cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lita Baluarte","original_name":"Lita Baluarte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jeannette","credit_id":"621530f0323eba004507c053","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1372546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimena Lindo","original_name":"Jimena Lindo","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/jZkUgISlzWnv0bcre1wUrHAXpWH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Leslie","credit_id":"621531230cd446001cc0cbc3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Galliani","original_name":"Sergio Galliani","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/vQpnoB6hxbibxT067m5qX4iNhog.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Winston","credit_id":"621531523f4833004474f988","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":145792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriela Velásquez","original_name":"Gabriela Velásquez","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/nNinvMshIhPtXwM23Wv3S3XLJAl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Madre De Álvaro","credit_id":"62153173323eba004507c1d4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aldo Miyashiro","original_name":"Aldo Miyashiro","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/9MpE4jW8YX0KRgFcjlF5ziGURjt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"La China","credit_id":"6215318f0cd446001cc0cd01","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1456143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Carlín","original_name":"Carlos Carlín","popularity":0.2798,"profile_path":"/uRPeNEIcDtyjBY00u0oDAW645PV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Fredy","credit_id":"621531b11a3248006abd5ec5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Carmona","original_name":"Jorge Carmona","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"TV Cameraman","credit_id":"621531c5323eba006c611f58","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Carmona","original_name":"Jorge Carmona","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621532081a3248001c4d5f9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lita Baluarte","original_name":"Lita Baluarte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6215321b0e4fc8001dcf7028","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457601,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gastón Vizcarra","original_name":"Gastón Vizcarra","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6215327a0bb076006b755aca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0997049","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
