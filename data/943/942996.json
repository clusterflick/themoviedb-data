The autumnal peace of the Kursanec forest is suddenly shattered by the noise of a hunting party. The leader of the hunters is Miklós Zrínyi, one of the most powerful men in the country. Neither he nor the members of the merry party can imagine how the day will end. The film presents a tragic event in Hungarian history, which is still not fully understood and which will later affect the fate of the whole country. Hunting accident or assassination? There are many theories and explanations, rumours and anecdotes about the events of this autumn day. Is it plausible that the life of a renowned general, an excellent hunter and a respected poet should come to such a fatal end? Who was he whose terrible fate was facilitated even by such potentates as Louis XIV, the Sun King?","popularity":0.2491,"poster_path":"/sIZkviGKh4b7LPTq8gi0mJhlDya.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film-Art Kft.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2018-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wildboar Hunting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":76469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamás Puskás","original_name":"Tamás Puskás","popularity":0.1668,"profile_path":"/50FkeKx2T1WYi5W63bBByzofRBQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrátor","credit_id":"62177696a88587006cd14820","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lajos Kovács","original_name":"Lajos Kovács","popularity":0.1233,"profile_path":"/7ka13V9zW3xO9wEtvLvuPPTl38Y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"idős Bethlen","credit_id":"621776dd5be00e0042099bbf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1896308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"József Kerekes","original_name":"József Kerekes","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/yKQEXz2yUT5vfQON6nr4HUuicke.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Porcia","credit_id":"62177702a27502006d72111a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antal Cserna","original_name":"Antal Cserna","popularity":0.2573,"profile_path":"/s9QXhWuRCP6bxrS0BXl9JuLL4DC.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Vitnyédi","credit_id":"62ca0f2d64de3500550993a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gábor Baronits","original_name":"Gábor Baronits","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Bethlen","credit_id":"62ca0f3cfd4a96004cec7114","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3109280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Konrád Quintus","original_name":"Konrád Quintus","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Zrínyi Péter","credit_id":"62ca0f56e8d028004f18cacb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3392267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Adányi","original_name":"Alex Adányi","popularity":0.1491,"profile_path":"/tDi80gpfa9t4MLW9ipxR2dDZ09c.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"I.
