Ten days took King John from ruler of an empire to sudden death, and left the kingdom in ruins. John is famous for the creation of Magna Carta, which inspired our modern democracy. Ben follows in the footsteps of the King's epic last journey, from the treacherous marshes of East Anglia, through Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire, to his final resting place in Worcester. He is joined by medieval historian professor Stephen Church. Together they examine the truth behind the legend that has lived on for 800 years. Did the crown jewels really end up in the mud of the Wash? Was the King poisoned? Does he deserve his reputation as our most disastrous monarch? Thanks to unique documents, we can tell this epic tale in the King's own words.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/iaiaYEg0XiRoRVjkptCf0C351ER.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Journey of the Magna Carta King","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2230699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Robinson","original_name":"Ben Robinson","popularity":0.1248,"profile_path":"/acFFKeZQIQZm91N3MrtQaGa8TC8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Presenter (as Dr Ben Robinson)","credit_id":"66b139f9875a4bb0e7eb7935","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stash Kirkbride","original_name":"Stash Kirkbride","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"King John (voice)","credit_id":"66b13a18df9eec0d360ce29a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389497,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diana Hare","original_name":"Diana Hare","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b13a2c2f0adeac28911768","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3269883,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Giles","original_name":"Martin Giles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b13a4432b847e21821ffa9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868921,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mark Killingback","original_name":"Mark Killingback","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b13a4ffe0db2c1ff2f451c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868922,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Wernham","original_name":"David Wernham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b13a58da6207565d9e5051","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868923,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mhairi Fraser","original_name":"Mhairi Fraser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b13a612829314e9225ee36","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4442478","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iaiaYEg0XiRoRVjkptCf0C351ER.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
