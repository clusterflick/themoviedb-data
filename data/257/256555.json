Christian Dietrich Grabbes lived a very short life in the first half of the 19th century and is primarily known for his satire, skepticism, basurd theater and the fact that he presaged the Postmodern movement in literature. Hannibal and Don Juan and Faust are two of his better-known works. In this docudrama, his Comedy, Satire, Irony and Deeper Meaning is featured partly because it gives a drubbing to the icons of German thought that had a stranglehold on the creative process. One memorable moment in this three-and-a-half-hour story is when the alcoholic writer is caught in the throes of delirium and comes around to see his own mother as a figure of death. The irony is that an Iranian director could capture the spirit and age of a German writer so well","popularity":0.1682,"poster_path":"/5fNCPnbnqlvDtsKYFStvkp97FEo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1775,"logo_path":"/ilL857W1zhtnudzvdlxrjIqLAvs.png","name":"Radio Bremen","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":204,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grabbe's Last Summer","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Grabbe's Last Summer","type":"English"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriele Fischer","original_name":"Gabriele Fischer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sophie Möller","credit_id":"53073f48c3a368538000057c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfried Grimpe","original_name":"Wilfried Grimpe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Christian Dietrich Grabbe","credit_id":"53073f69c3a368158200009d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eberhard Fechner","original_name":"Eberhard Fechner","popularity":0.213,"profile_path":"/gWePCblx1P8NRfG53B5IyY9sLKY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Piderit","credit_id":"533b25619251413bb400007b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1865517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonja Karzau","original_name":"Sonja Karzau","popularity":0.0413,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dorothea Grabbe","credit_id":"5e542753f48b340015738b4b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gunther Malzacher","original_name":"Gunther Malzacher","popularity":0.0727,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Althaus","credit_id":"5e54277635811d00195ab617","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1555451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Rabe","original_name":"Heinz Rabe","popularity":0.0573,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Stedtfeld","credit_id":"5e5427ca35811d0015598ffa","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Radszun","original_name":"Alexander Radszun","popularity":0.1936,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Maler Bergius","credit_id":"5e5427e2a93d2500174dbf7b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renate Schroeter","original_name":"Renate Schroeter","popularity":0.1976,"profile_path":"/vOleZaujgw0W44CvYXWVpT111LW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Luise Grabbe","credit_id":"5e5427fda76ac50016a75020","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1317456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrich von Bock","original_name":"Ulrich von Bock","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Moritz Petri","credit_id":"5e54281435811d00195ab80e","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sohrab Shahid Saless","original_name":"Sohrab Shahid Saless","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/1q6TU6p7f4pGxXul1Nbu2jGjBgJ.jpg","credit_id":"53073461925141529900070f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1519038,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Valentin","original_name":"Thomas Valentin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5427fca93d25001a4d400e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1129956","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5fNCPnbnqlvDtsKYFStvkp97FEo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":842,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fbi2DgS5jBhmqBRfv9aDfIG3IcR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":572},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1646,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xe6r5QKMxGr9Bgv9BzB8EPfWVMM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1106}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
