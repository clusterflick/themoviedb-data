Hexagonal refractions and spectral rays puncture alluded-to landscapes - rivers, skies, prairies, trees, mountains. Graphic (yet spatially free-floating) imagery slices intently wrought rhythms of light and dark color fields, producing afterimages. The film concludes with bright, almost-discernible window shapes, hinting at an opening to a different realm.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/y0mbVPrdyye8h8QGvmuhcFh6Eej.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Crossing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timoleon Wilkins","original_name":"Timoleon Wilkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5302ea319251412195459828","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7472962","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":1521,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y0mbVPrdyye8h8QGvmuhcFh6Eej.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1003}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
