The famous portrait of Bach portrays a grumpy 62-year-old man in a wig and formal coat, yet his greatest works were composed 20 years earlier in an almost unrivalled blaze of creativity.  We reveal a complex and passionate artist; a warm and convivial family man at the same time a rebellious spirit struggling with the hierarchies of state and church who wrote timeless music that is today known world-wide. Gardiner undertakes a 'Bach Tour' of Germany, and sifts the relatively few clues we have - some newly-found.  Most of all, he uses the music to reveal the real Bach.","popularity":0.3686,"poster_path":"/A11DZ1ZizRsZ4fqhcdRNxpG45p3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bach: A Passionate Life","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338572,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Eliot Gardiner","original_name":"John Eliot Gardiner","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/pIHSar5WD1PlfynCuAn8PHuNvA2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56afbd8b92514101fc0008e1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1008238,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Jeffcock","original_name":"David Jeffcock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5305633392514134880da3a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1008238,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Jeffcock","original_name":"David Jeffcock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5305633e925141348b0d37bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cesca Eaton","original_name":"Cesca Eaton","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5305634d92514134a20cdec5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294722,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cesca Eaton","original_name":"Cesca Eaton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5305636a925141348b0d3cdc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1137221,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fiona Morris","original_name":"Fiona Morris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5305637f925141348b0d3cf8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4888862","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":2601,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A11DZ1ZizRsZ4fqhcdRNxpG45p3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1741}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":191718,"name":"baroque"},{"id":229292,"name":"choral music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
