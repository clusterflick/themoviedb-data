A window onto Quebec in the late 1960s, this protest film explores these characters’ daily lives, their trials and aspirations. Where Are You? is an innovative and militant work, buoyed by hard-hitting film language that includes subtitles and intertitles, quotations, offscreen voices and songs and references to advertising.","popularity":0.1541,"poster_path":"/5oRNuBjDU1SrkNUUIGWehDj0n08.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1970-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where Are You?","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2361548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Claude Bernard","original_name":"Jean-Claude Bernard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Christian Truck driver and bass player","credit_id":"5f90df77d9f4a60038d9d328","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2824909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane Bernatchez","original_name":"Diane Bernatchez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Brunette girl in the field","credit_id":"5f90df8c55c1f4003924cae0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2824910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Dor","original_name":"Georges Dor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Georges","credit_id":"5f90df9955c1f4003620dd7e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2824911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Jourdan","original_name":"Danielle Jourdan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Danielle","credit_id":"5f90dfa455c1f4003924cc74","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1900390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mouffe","original_name":"Mouffe","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/78IiAA5oDzzaRNdWY53lCl7MeOr.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mouffe","credit_id":"5f90dfb2383df20034b0c87f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2824912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjolaine Tugeon","original_name":"Marjolaine Tugeon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Blonde girl in the field","credit_id":"5f90dfbe55c1f4003924cd3b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1605480,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stéphane Venne","original_name":"Stéphane Venne","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/acuAsrmzaedDE32DJRn8pqrkpOc.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Stéphane Venne","credit_id":"5f90dfcad9f4a60038d9d3fa","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Groulx","original_name":"Gilles Groulx","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/5TuaKsLodWcCgl4HTgnFZPUggyG.jpg","credit_id":"53280d5b9251411a11001d35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Groulx","original_name":"Gilles Groulx","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/5TuaKsLodWcCgl4HTgnFZPUggyG.jpg","credit_id":"53280d679251411a1b001d67","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1594953,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy L.
