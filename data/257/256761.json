The tunnels terminated in what was one of the greatest architectural achievements of its time, Pennsylvania Station. Penn Station covered nearly eight acres, extended two city blocks, and housed one of the largest public spaces in the world. But just 53 years after the stationâ€™s opening, the monumental building that was supposed to last forever, to herald and represent the American Empire, was slated to be destroyed.","popularity":1.9153,"poster_path":"/afHIEEZUhrHChnzyLkgWfc3KmvX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rise & Fall of Penn Station","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"American Experience: The Rise and Fall of Penn Station","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Murphy","original_name":"Michael Murphy","popularity":0.444,"profile_path":"/3quWjoqh8vKoSXE9Ll3AC7pgsRh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"57252594c3a36836a900088c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1929134,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Molly Jacobs","original_name":"Molly Jacobs","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6220274c902012006d465b6d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Randall MacLowry","original_name":"Randall MacLowry","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5725253fc3a368305a00171d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Randall MacLowry","original_name":"Randall MacLowry","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57252547c3a3685ac10010b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1814377,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Jenkins","original_name":"John Jenkins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a18e29a9251410336022bcb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1929123,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rob Jaret","original_name":"Rob Jaret","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a18e4190e0a264cd0022a38","department":"Sound","job":"Orchestrator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1657196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Rivera","original_name":"Danny Rivera","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a18e5330e0a264cbc02395e","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Services"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1929122,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lisa Suslowicz","original_name":"Lisa Suslowicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a18e3e00e0a264cca022b6f","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1929121,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Sebring","original_name":"Richard Sebring","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a18e3cec3a3680b96022b40","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541756,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"P.
