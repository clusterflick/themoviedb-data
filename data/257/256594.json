He inherits an old house from his grandfather far from the city and must travel there accompanied by Américo (Carlos Frasca), a clerk somewhat depressed by his old age. The driver and owner of the truck in which they travel is Beto (Jorge Esmoris), a carrier with a somewhat murky past. The place where they are going was visited by the English naturalist Charles Darwin in 1833, where he collected fundamental information to later develop the theory of evolution.","popularity":0.1997,"poster_path":"/nZcaslR2T0mqt2lMcdFqvZEsyTH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transparent
