Much of the ideas for the piece emerged during post-production. The Euonymus mid fall \"natural\" leaves are startling, their colors are so saturated as to appear unreal, their purity so uniform as to appear manufactured. It has long been a fascination of mine to activate shared qualities living in parallel universes; always, that which is present in the make up of the digital cinema image and that of the physical world it is representing.  Assumptions we make about the real world, the way it is recorded, or more appropriately translated, are cultural constructs. The inevitable biblical conotations of the Burning Bush refers to man made poetic as well as insttutional constructs. - VG","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":"/mgeN8LUSp75cXLgBI7xbZNMB5HT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burning Bush","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Grenier","original_name":"Vincent Grenier","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/9Pbwc4bS0m40fU5HdQU04Iw5tmB.jpg","credit_id":"6329a9346af9dd00821a18e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2543184","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mgeN8LUSp75cXLgBI7xbZNMB5HT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
