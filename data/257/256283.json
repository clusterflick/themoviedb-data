Some of these portraits are now regarded as classics of the genre - Samuel Beckett, Queen Elizabeth II, The Beatles, Bertrand Russell, Mick Jagger and Margaret Thatcher.  For the first time, she spoke candidly about her career and revealed how her very personal approach to the taking of portraits is informed by a deep sense of loss and abandonment. This private portrait is enhanced by a series of insightful interviews with Janeâ€™s peers, family, colleagues, friends, and of course some of her subjects.","popularity":0.1721,"poster_path":"/obJpzIaYYFWyVrEeonwD8Ih7R5v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hot Property Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jane Bown photographer","title":"Looking for Light: Jane Bown","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rankin","original_name":"Rankin","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":"/2ULpv2fYNVvoQuiAxUnvZlBEBJP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"561f82c7c3a3680e19002fa5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":108293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobby Clark","original_name":"Nobby Clark","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"561f82d5c3a3680e1d00327f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1522751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don McCullin","original_name":"Don McCullin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/uTqE9fZM2KfJRFjiLq4araODvw1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"561f82e8c3a3680e16002c41","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Bown","original_name":"Jane Bown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"561f831fc3a3680e2000326d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Dodd","original_name":"Luke Dodd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5358dab30e0a260682008496","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Whyte","original_name":"Michael Whyte","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5358dac30e0a26068400831d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Whyte","original_name":"Michael Whyte","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561f825dc3a3680e240032a8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Whyte","original_name":"Michael Whyte","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561f826cc3a3680e1400312d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1038732,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janine Marmot","original_name":"Janine Marmot","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea8f598e870200863fe705","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Whyte","original_name":"Michael Whyte","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea8fb51f3e600089ddb8fd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Dodd","original_name":"Luke Dodd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea8fbf1f3e6000c0318fb6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3103564","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1124,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/obJpzIaYYFWyVrEeonwD8Ih7R5v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":812}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LOOKING FOR LIGHT: JANE BOWN | Official UK Trailer - in selected cinemas 25th APRIL","key":"jgH6OlZsihM","published_at":"2014-04-04T16:39:17.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"5358da490e0a2606820083db"}]}}}
