(Five years earlier Jim's engagement to Marjorie Dare was broken when her mother was killed and his father disappeared.) Through certain circumstance Marjorie also becomes Leighton's guest, and Jim moves out into the woods. There he meets Smiles, a little girl in the care of strange old Ben Tangleface. Leighton wishes to wed Marjorie for her money and is trying forcefully to persuade her to accept him when Jim comes to the rescue. But Ben, his memory stirred by the sight of Leighton, kills him. Explanations reveal Smiles to be Dorothy's sister and Ben, Jim's father. He was wounded while defending Marjorie's mother, whom Leighton killed.","popularity":0.545,"poster_path":"/hePfcxIjSJTHmCdCXhzG2KtUW5o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145112,"logo_path":null,"name":"Logan Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Clouded Name","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norma Shearer","original_name":"Norma Shearer","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/3sVqygC3vCn75JT5yP5Ar7uhfnz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marjorie Dare","credit_id":"5307d472c3a36841fc000b03","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladden James","original_name":"Gladden James","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":"/uW1fpWXpEo2mLneq95yO004xQNs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jim Allen","credit_id":"5307d47dc3a368421b000ba9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Logan","original_name":"Yvonne Logan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Smiles","credit_id":"5307d486c3a368421b000baf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Neill","original_name":"Richard Neill","popularity":0.3204,"profile_path":"/jolpsR5bhdTugkNpnBQYgt0q9Vh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Stewart Leighton","credit_id":"60579a126f6a99006b27aa45","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Miller","original_name":"Charles Miller","popularity":0.0815,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sam Slocum","credit_id":"56a247f8925141370b00b04b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Eckhart","original_name":"Frederick Eckhart","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ben Tangleface","credit_id":"5307d4d1c3a368420b000c66","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Langford","original_name":"Martha Langford","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Davenport","credit_id":"60579affeec4f3006b987a41","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Bradley","original_name":"Marion Bradley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Davenport's Maid","credit_id":"60579b082ac499002accd5b6","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1919676,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tom Bret","original_name":"Tom Bret","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60579b194557a0006818f41c","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019232,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean Logan","original_name":"Jean Logan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60579b26ab1bc7003da77df4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1919676,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tom Bret","original_name":"Tom Bret","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60579b2deec4f3003e88d6df","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Austin O.
