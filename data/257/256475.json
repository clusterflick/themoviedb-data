Slash is arrested, Lizard King is assaulted by a skatepark ledge, and Furby’s board is stolen. They then turn vigilante as they stalk the mean streets of Los Angeles with Moose and Neen Williams, on the prowl for handrails, gaps and dangerous spots of that nature. The Deathwish Video is an epic and controversial film that is frank and original in its treatment of urban skateboarding and the average citizen’s helplessness in dealing with it. Various artists wrote the musical score. And watch for a young Jon Dickson in his film debut as one of the pros.","popularity":0.2125,"poster_path":"/mkk37Cx3by947TcDkzbJILMCPA6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Deathwish Video","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Ellington","original_name":"Erik Ellington","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/oXdeGY6nx5ZQWSeqx7cC2I1I70G.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"530633f4c3a3685a71283493","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Greco","original_name":"Jim Greco","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/wqgqPqaQmrMsQJMm1Xh1HHIRh7l.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"531e04cbc3a3685c510083f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Plumb","original_name":"Mike Plumb","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":"/mHPieZkHri4LVamPG8P3t4Uihoq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"531e04dac3a3685c510083f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1989574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramiro Salcedo","original_name":"Ramiro Salcedo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jwzHumJklzF5febv7cNrG5kPY35.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"61e0d857bf0f630068f0e933","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neen Williams","original_name":"Neen Williams","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/3CZtQC7WqyPsYFnqZgmTRz3hTVp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"531e04f9c3a368726d000e0e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antwuan Dixon","original_name":"Antwuan Dixon","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/6XgMumuJ7cjqh7CIC1FhUMP8pTO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"531e0506c3a3685baa000e28","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Luis De Los Reyes","original_name":"Michael Luis De Los Reyes","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/8mnwyWw8XjwREcsw5f5nLg8sHdC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"531e0518c3a3685c3d0083f6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Hansen","original_name":"Brian Hansen","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/q5HfIiTjFoyXrdPsWMJ6hBbKEc9.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"531e0532c3a3685c37008831","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Dickson","original_name":"Jon Dickson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gLEafTSihGJdc6qNuupXNzPMxuP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"531e054dc3a368363f000c72","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1756379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baker Boys","original_name":"Baker Boys","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a08d7e92514126030090de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Greco","original_name":"Jim Greco","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/wqgqPqaQmrMsQJMm1Xh1HHIRh7l.jpg","credit_id":"58a08d57925141260000864a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Ellington","original_name":"Erik Ellington","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/oXdeGY6nx5ZQWSeqx7cC2I1I70G.jpg","credit_id":"58a08d46c3a36802fd008cda","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4571366","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mkk37Cx3by947TcDkzbJILMCPA6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Deathwish Video Coming Soon!","key":"NX1B_x04D_w","published_at":"2011-07-12T12:47:25.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec72cc3a368544800be14"}]}}}
