But unlike last time, he has no money, no machine, no nothing. Does he even stand a chance? On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced one of the most calamitous nuclear disasters in history. But in two national elections following the accident, the pro-nuclear Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) achieved landslide victories, gaining control of the two parliaments. Why? 'Campaign 2' by Kazuhiro Soda observes a small local election right after the disaster and gives insight into this difficult question, presenting a microcosm of Japan's political-psychological landscape.","popularity":0.106,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12457,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laboratory X","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Campaign 2","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Senkyo 2","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1295642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuhiko Yamauchi","original_name":"Kazuhiko Yamauchi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"530929d9c3a368420b002efd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuhiro Soda","original_name":"想田和弘","popularity":0.1433,"profile_path":"/8FP554mg7tp1UbcTx055Ux3nwrG.jpg","credit_id":"530929b6c3a368421b002d5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2279571,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kiyoko Kashiwagi","original_name":"Kiyoko Kashiwagi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb73f490e0a266b90ef3a7a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuhiro Soda","original_name":"想田和弘","popularity":0.1433,"profile_path":"/8FP554mg7tp1UbcTx055Ux3nwrG.jpg","credit_id":"5ca5d9da0e0a261b9ab5b88e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuhiro Soda","original_name":"想田和弘","popularity":0.1433,"profile_path":"/8FP554mg7tp1UbcTx055Ux3nwrG.jpg","credit_id":"5ca5d9e00e0a261b89b5bf7b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuhiro Soda","original_name":"想田和弘","popularity":0.1433,"profile_path":"/8FP554mg7tp1UbcTx055Ux3nwrG.jpg","credit_id":"5ca5d9e8c3a36866b0af57f4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2912922","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
