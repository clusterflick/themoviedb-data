Somewhat less concerned with myths of the old west than its predecessor, BLUE SUN WESTERN, this film paints a portrait of a mystic and beautiful landscape - itself a living character of the pre-historic west. In this locale the sun's light is both emitted from, and reflected by blue-black depths: coral-like rock formations provide the backdrop for a shadow-play of vibrations extending beyond the lake's ancient basin. Outside of time, these ripples echo through neon boulevards of present day, an 1800s-era cemetery, and back again - always in the formidable presence of the pyramid. On the soundtrack, a ghostly chorus rises and gives way to a ballad for a cowboy bandit - an extension of shared romantic hope.  \"The most successful metaphoric envisionment of the desert that I've seen in many years.\" - Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lake of the Spirits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timoleon Wilkins","original_name":"Timoleon Wilkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5302e867925141219b4897f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7504772","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
