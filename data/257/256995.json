There he contends with his new co-workers, a ragtag group of tennis pro misfits; his boss Sherry, a strong-willed, single mother; and her son Jake, a goth teenager and secret tennis hopeful.  Slowly Owen begins to win over his colleagues, mend his broken friendships and help Jake fix his serve … and develops a romantic connection with Sherry, despite her insistence that she doesn't date tennis pros.  Just when things seem to be looking up, Owen’s former boss and court nemesis challenges the Derby City club to a showdown in the annual Combo Cup tennis tournament.  As he leads his team of oddball amateurs, Owen learns the most valuable lesson of all … On the court or off, everyone deserves a second chance!\"","popularity":2.0833,"poster_path":"/vFnFg8uFS5blheh2MtnKxiHmb4B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the game of love you gotta have balls.","title":"2nd Serve","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Hopkins","original_name":"Josh Hopkins","popularity":0.5139,"profile_path":"/gPcG3xAnuUP9pMxGWkhb5nQqOPQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Owen Match","credit_id":"530bc53ec3a36875f9000404","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Monaghan","original_name":"Cameron Monaghan","popularity":2.8369,"profile_path":"/gegD6j2xaDCTFByssg8PDbuUbjR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Carlos","credit_id":"530bc434c3a368760600039b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Magnussen","original_name":"Billy Magnussen","popularity":1.5388,"profile_path":"/ahN5ORcyyY6dbJCgHsKvf6cbX3O.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lingo","credit_id":"58d33e1dc3a368125f009936","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Sussman","original_name":"Kevin Sussman","popularity":0.816,"profile_path":"/tLqrE9uz6GKoeoDC7LU7cE6oF2Q.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Scott Belcher / O.C.D.","credit_id":"530bc50dc3a36876060003af","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Díaz","original_name":"Guillermo Díaz","popularity":1.1107,"profile_path":"/oso3tpCcf6wbjeHk2bpeKMV52zP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Carlos","credit_id":"530bc4f7c3a368763500039d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dash Mihok","original_name":"Dash Mihok","popularity":0.8893,"profile_path":"/jnruNUJv57nNtO66SR3oJ5tQuM5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Charles","credit_id":"530bc51bc3a36875ff0003db","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam McMurray","original_name":"Sam McMurray","popularity":0.9615,"profile_path":"/pbZSG0hprUcRkUF3q4NUUzvQX3E.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Coach Bussey","credit_id":"530bc54fc3a36876060003b7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexie Gilmore","original_name":"Alexie Gilmore","popularity":0.4789,"profile_path":"/1Ev9eTuu8bL6t8xzfqchZm4wSfI.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Sherry","credit_id":"62d26131158c85029e9ab3e8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":226962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonny Burnette","original_name":"Sonny Burnette","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":"/kK1XDB06ymyVSe39Q4wrIdWoqob.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Judge Simms","credit_id":"62d2614ae48860004d5c15af","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2205405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyndy Allen","original_name":"Cyndy Allen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Bree","credit_id":"62d26164d399e6004e71c27c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1905016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leah Roberts","original_name":"Leah Roberts","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/tHcpJwHRW5cV5xzBUsSOEneCR8x.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Dina","credit_id":"62d26176e488600050279c71","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2194714,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chrissy Joy","original_name":"Chrissy Joy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/4K18BuKHDLSFDd4dxH46W4cjA1N.jpg","cast_id":26,"character":"Emily","credit_id":"62d2618653f833005473bc29","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Kirkman","original_name":"Tim Kirkman","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":"/qLEV1f5A6gtfsbsqJEVscTxivKt.jpg","credit_id":"530f7e87c3a368744e001303","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297132,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Markert","original_name":"James Markert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530f7e99c3a36874910012ba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297133,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jay Thames","original_name":"Jay Thames","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/n2w5I8KJEPxHxLY6oAdvz4PfKur.jpg","credit_id":"530f7eaac3a368747500137e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086892,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael A.
