B. Priestley, first performed in 1945 (in Russia) and 1946 (in the UK). It is considered to be one of Priestley's best known works for the stage and one of the classics of mid-20th century English theatre. The play's success and reputation has been boosted in recent years by a successful revival by English director Stephen Daldry for the National Theatre in 1992. This is a re-edited version of the 1982 BBC TV adaptation, originally serialised in three parts.","popularity":0.8589,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Inspector Calls","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel Davenport","original_name":"Nigel Davenport","popularity":0.321,"profile_path":"/v7ebqfzimSOjRc1vFGgTCSP1P6a.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Arthur Birling","credit_id":"5302d47b925141218c498eb9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Hepton","original_name":"Bernard Hepton","popularity":0.3953,"profile_path":"/ud9XqroQkWEdR58W5bK0aRZhGqR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Inspector Goole","credit_id":"5302d4999251412198484c5c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Tyzack","original_name":"Margaret Tyzack","popularity":0.3732,"profile_path":"/n7S4qtgp0DA9gtkzEXB7r5tt6jH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sybil Birling","credit_id":"5302d4b9925141218f4851fe","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":178565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Berger","original_name":"Sarah Berger","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sheila Birling","credit_id":"5302d4dc925141219247e091","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Sibley","original_name":"David Sibley","popularity":0.2797,"profile_path":"/97j1onIMZMZtUaqFgbWf9W1WpCg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Eric Birling","credit_id":"5302d4fb9251412195432d6a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Ward","original_name":"Simon Ward","popularity":0.5522,"profile_path":"/dxcsfsuez7z4zDVJLtYLaMW0yp8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gerald Croft","credit_id":"5302d51992514121a7453475","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1051556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Leppard","original_name":"Jean Leppard","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":"/v48qEd8kEhQL52F6QMbZvO17lq0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Edna","credit_id":"5302d534925141219b46809c","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1226610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Simpson","original_name":"Michael Simpson","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5302d37892514121984840a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0416376","wikidata_id":"Q4750077","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dK0xHA5GFuyLBg25ctifF1PAm0k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC One","release_date":"1984-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
