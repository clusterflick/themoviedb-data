During a previous tour viewers could overthrow them both with one shot, but this time that these birds will soar on shotguns. Each with its splendor, with its poison. Joan Manuel Serrat keeps intact the moral, tough, committed contempt of difficult times, but always wrapped in the aura of a joy of living, in favor of simple pleasures, the melancholy of those trams transported to the beaches on Sunday to overcome people and returned to the city only defeated by the sun, with salty lips and burned skin. And among so many words of love Serrat, the hoarse cries of Sabina, both fused, and although the two crossing their songs, one with guitar and the heart will scratch another liver.","popularity":0.5666,"poster_path":"/vms67i27eBLC8MVwVkrfOctBIXG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4375,"logo_path":"/eo8fJbkpiz9Wdsl1qDSEX4GXeZH.png","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2012-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Serrat & Sabina: dos pájaros contraatacan","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Dos Pajaros Contraatacan","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joaquín Sabina","original_name":"Joaquín Sabina","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/8CT1H6RSEQpRUpUI6RAREvh3Ua3.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"53020e9c925141218f2c9b18","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Manuel Serrat","original_name":"Joan Manuel Serrat","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":"/kdsB7uZfRdENJXXVTScbVfuuBcz.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5776c8d99251415dc8000a79","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Miralles","original_name":"Ricardo Miralles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Piano y Arreglos","credit_id":"53021401c3a3680a372ce776","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pancho Varona","original_name":"Pancho Varona","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/pFcpZMr8JdxLuWOV9zZiUtmKzu6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Guitarra y Voz","credit_id":"53021414c3a3680a283084a8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio García de Diego","original_name":"Antonio García de Diego","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/jU1VOA9x7Cx1CiIHPwr71Ms9Wkd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Guitarra y Voz","credit_id":"53021426c3a3680a3f2eb0ab","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Palau","original_name":"David Palau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Guitarra","credit_id":"53021438c3a3680a1130f9d6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Barceló","original_name":"Pedro Barceló","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gps5YVXsbzfzdlmRHulDHsIIDMS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bateria","credit_id":"53021447c3a3685ce7045242","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Víctor Merlo","original_name":"Víctor Merlo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bajo","credit_id":"53021454c3a3685ce70453a5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Miguel Pérez Sagaste","original_name":"José Miguel Pérez Sagaste","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Saxo","credit_id":"53021464c3a3680a213037b8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marra Barros","original_name":"Marra Barros","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Coros","credit_id":"53021481c3a3680a21303818","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorena Calero","original_name":"Lorena Calero","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Coros","credit_id":"5302148fc3a3680a092b7dae","order":10}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1142,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vms67i27eBLC8MVwVkrfOctBIXG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":6415,"name":"stage show"},{"id":10610,"name":"live"},{"id":155710,"name":"rock musical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
