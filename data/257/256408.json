They fall in love, but can't elope because Piyal is of a lower class. Nanda's parents instead push her into a marriage with Jinadasa, who is of the same class as them. With economic downturn in Sri Lanka, both families lose their status and Jinadasa leaves to try to make a better life for himself; he never achieves his goal and dies penniless. Piyal and Nanda can now finally come together. They have changed however, and the earlier idylic nature of their relationship is not recaptured.","popularity":0.2458,"poster_path":"/4DcE1EJBFvCmlM6ea6iQ2YdqPxo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71219,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinelanka","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","name":"Sri Lanka"}],"release_date":"1963-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Sinhalese","iso_639_1":"si","name":"සිංහල"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Changes in the Village","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","title":"Gamperaliya","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Punya Hiendeniya","original_name":"Punya Hiendeniya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Nanda","credit_id":"5306667bc3a368704800022d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1295033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Jayasena","original_name":"Henry Jayasena","popularity":0.1121,"profile_path":"/gRnAa9GdM0sSo51WWMIfMhi5q1c.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pryal Weliweli","credit_id":"53066696c3a368704e00021d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wickrema Bogoda","original_name":"Wickrema Bogoda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/exWgmo1DdN2pNUGnNOJRZnjffij.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tissa","credit_id":"530666a7c3a368707000022b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trelicia Gunawardena","original_name":"Trelicia Gunawardena","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Anula","credit_id":"530666bbc3a3687070000235","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1295038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gamini Fonseka","original_name":"Gamini Fonseka","popularity":0.1902,"profile_path":"/2H514spPaNRBqKm2KqwN3u9RFm9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jinadasa","credit_id":"530666cec3a368707000023a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1203649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malini Fonseka","original_name":"Malini Fonseka","popularity":0.1721,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5684f309c3a3685f8900641b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lester James Peries","original_name":"Lester James Peries","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5305972e925141349e122c48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295043,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Reggie Siriwardena","original_name":"Reggie Siriwardena","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530666f0c3a3687048000236","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2361289,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martin Wickremasinghe","original_name":"Martin Wickremasinghe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2a8633be4b3612f6a7e490","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2361290,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"W.D.
