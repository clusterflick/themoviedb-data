Complications threaten when Hans's roommate Max falls in love with her, but the situation is resolved: the three remain friends, and decide to form a music hall act. They want to ascend, but how? A way out beckons when a theatrical agent named Nevin enters Else’s life. He is played by Hubert von Meyerinck as a slick and oily villain, who oozes refinement; his experience behind bars is waved away with a silk scarf. He is cunning to the point of perfidiousness, but is not completely unsympathetic. He also embodies a new type - the scrounger.","popularity":0.3949,"poster_path":"/9cn9oS8or1f5xxKVh6FSnJuoFBG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gerhard Lamprecht
