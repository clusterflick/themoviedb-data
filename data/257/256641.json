Sita is never actually seen in the film, but her virtual presence is compellingly evoked in the moods of the forest and the elements. The film retells the epic from a womens' liberationist perspective, and is about the tragedy of power and the sacrifices that adherence to dharma demands, including abandoning a chaste wife.","popularity":0.4348,"poster_path":"/1dImu1Slz9RwAY98gWuAKzxtoNR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76002,"logo_path":null,"name":"General Pictures","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1978-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""},{"english_name":"Sanskrit","iso_639_1":"sa","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kanchana Sita","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Golden Sita","type":"International Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Golden Substitute","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Kanchana Sita","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramdas","original_name":"Ramdas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rama","credit_id":"537f05920e0a2624bd0042d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keshav Panicker","original_name":"Keshav Panicker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Valmiki","credit_id":"537f05bb0e0a2624c30041ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1881445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ravindram Nair","original_name":"Ravindram Nair","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"59ab412c925141072f01c080","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1881446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chinnapuliah","original_name":"Chinnapuliah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"59ab4130925141077e01be21","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1881447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Venkateswarlu","original_name":"Venkateswarlu","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"59ab4139925141079d01b155","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1107237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kondavalasa Lakshmana Rao","original_name":"Kondavalasa Lakshmana Rao","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"59ab4143925141077e01be3a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158782,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shaji N.
