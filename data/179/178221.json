His passion to bring the church closer to the common people sets him on a collision course with his new superior, Father Nostler. When Mohr organizes a church choir that includes outcasts from the local tavern and performs in German instead of Latin, Nostler threatens him with disciplinary action. Their relationship further deteriorates when Maria a regular tavern patron, surprisingly joins the performance of the all-male church choir. As Mohr's initial successes start to crumble and his efforts backfire on him, he loses all hope and faces a trial of faith. The night before Christmas, Mohr has to decide if he will accept defeat and leave Oberndorf or embrace the true significance of the Holy Night.","popularity":0.5685,"poster_path":"/wNtV2kyJz1YTmmaQuQHFbeEXVOz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5226,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mirror Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2013-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The powerful true story behind the most popular Christmas carol of all time","title":"Silent Night","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Stille Nacht - Eine wahre Weihnachtsgeschichte","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1497804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carsten Clemens","original_name":"Carsten Clemens","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/z5J0MXR9uGBLl76IUZnW1JZWJVv.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Joseph Mohr","credit_id":"55d2383d92514117fb000253","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus von Lingen","original_name":"Markus von Lingen","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":"/oVKd7JyYOoOgrqbZ3LLfhzrAA6.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Franz Gruber","credit_id":"55d23851c3a36834200002ed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1124361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janina Elkin","original_name":"Janina Elkin","popularity":0.239,"profile_path":"/AsCE5yoVm5ZCADZnkTLQvPiprkE.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"55d23868925141180000029a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1103837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander E.
