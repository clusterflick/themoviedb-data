Sidiki struggles to cope with his disability and to earn a decent living, but he still manages to teach workshops for disabled kids, busk on the street, rehearse with his musical group, bicycle with his hands, and prepare for a baby naming ceremony, where he plays djembe drums, sings, and dances on his hands.","popularity":0.1899,"poster_path":"/dC5GSoQ1nQ037yR7Q8ldKjBzqq5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Don't Need Feet to Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidiki Conde","original_name":"Sidiki Conde","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4d95c3a36847f8268e69","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1038504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Govenar","original_name":"Alan Govenar","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d95c3a36847f8268e65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2734552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dC5GSoQ1nQ037yR7Q8ldKjBzqq5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":10583,"name":"performance art"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":162735,"name":"disability"},{"id":195593,"name":"physical disability"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
