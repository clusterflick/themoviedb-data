In the cloud world where the angels live, there is a 'Rascal' department where Chief Angel Manuel makes 'Rascal Angels' of children who behave like brats on earth. The children who become 'Rascal Angels' must be good for 24 hours on earth and are not allowed to violate the Angel Book. If they do make a mistake, they are punished in a very special way.
