The wall looks to be about 20 feet above sea level and extend at least 100 feet into the water. A large wave rolls picturesquely along the wall toward the shore. Smaller waves follow. Then the scene changes to river water flowing. We see both shores: in the foreground a log and tree branch are visible; on the far shore, there appears to be a low wall with trees beyond it. The camera is stationary in both shots.","popularity":0.1674,"poster_path":"/w4Jnoc3GMLBayGzDxnuybRFraq9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54189,"logo_path":null,"name":"Birt Acres","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":44944,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robert W.
