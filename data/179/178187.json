Or maybe not...as Steven, a handsome young theater history professor discovers when he sets out to write a stage thriller - a plain, old generic thriller - only to discover that his characters prefer a character study - and want it to be a movie, not a play. At least Steven can create the man of his dreams, right? But that character - Vertigo - named after Steven's sixth grade teacher Mr. Vertigo (Steven always dates men named Vertigo) - isn't really cooperating. Will Steven ever finish his play? Will Vertigo behave (or rather, misbehave) as Steven wishes? And what about the friends on whom Steven is basing his other characters - will they still be his friends when it's all over?","popularity":0.0475,"poster_path":"/eaNEGalWaQoyzTV3oJ53FRgxskq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Generic Thriller","video":false,"vote_average":1.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":994327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Sublett","original_name":"Scott Sublett","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a95e93fc3a36811a30077dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0910555","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eaNEGalWaQoyzTV3oJ53FRgxskq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Generic Thriller - Trailer","key":"5xfL5E7Z7as","published_at":"2009-08-10T23:56:57.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec706c3a368544800a3da"}]}}}
