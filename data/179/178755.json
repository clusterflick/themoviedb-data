A cortege of Arabs, about 20 persons in the party, walk past; the dignitaries are in front, attended by men with horns and drums. Coming in the other direction are local Swiss, who pay little attention, and a group of native-garbed Africans. The dozen or so well-dressed denizens of Geneva who are sitting on the steps of the Divan take it all in.","popularity":0.2873,"poster_path":"/fQQlJRfjwbEBEDqaKA3ko492BOR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumière","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1896-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arab Cortege, Geneva","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Arab menet","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Lumière","original_name":"Louis Lumière","popularity":0.2875,"profile_path":"/1Hh4lEqRWOrB4kybXJF6JdCchy.jpg","credit_id":"609434f40d9f5a0057882685","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1867,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Auguste Lumière","original_name":"Auguste Lumière","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60943500a6d93100580a54f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1161489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Promio","original_name":"Alexandre Promio","popularity":0.1925,"profile_path":"/rkbZfozqP6QfhnXaIvam40jMHQA.jpg","credit_id":"6094351e0372640029e37b54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0256607","wikidata_id":"Q115664951","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fQQlJRfjwbEBEDqaKA3ko492BOR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1896-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
