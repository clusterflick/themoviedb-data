They encounter a number of artists, musicians, publishers and other characters populating the post-Yugoslav indie cultural scene. As the journey continues through increasingly improbable surroundings, the protagonists begin to question themselves and the reality they find themselves in. Watching border controls turn into improvised snapshot sessions, admiring mutant iron-curtain Disney toys, buying souvenir grenade shell handicrafts and discovering sniper art in blown-out apartments, they find that truth may indeed be stranger than fiction.","popularity":0.1161,"poster_path":"/zcxChOsWivsSyGytgDzKcqScqfl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nail
