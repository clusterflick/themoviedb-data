His work is full of anger and rage. Societies intolerance has left its mark on Roger. He has, himself, been a victim of bashing, as have several friends. Because of experiences in his later teens, he has become obsessed with the violence rained down upon gay men and the lack of concern society has shown. This obsession boils out in his art that is full of violence and rage. Such canvases fill his loft: the exception being a single romantic painting.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/ibUKiLSLQSPB9mWNPlhzmHU3rah.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fall, Hot Rain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norbert Orlewicz","original_name":"Norbert Orlewicz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6371b79721621b00b49f5125","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2572575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Hunt","original_name":"Matthew Hunt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e74eccea055ef00122aa011","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2572576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Revesz","original_name":"Adam Revesz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e74ecdfb7d35200117691c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wlwwSGh44HNnEhm8CatFVpMs5OV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ibUKiLSLQSPB9mWNPlhzmHU3rah.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
