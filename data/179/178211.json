The disruption captured the world's attention. When the airlines resumed their normal routes and headlines started to fade, the farmers under the volcano were fighting for their livestock and livelihood as they still are today.  The film ‘ASH' follows three farming families living under the volcano to see the effect of the ash on their lives and livelihood. It is a character-driven creative documentary about the aftermath under the volcano.","popularity":0.1159,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ash","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":59991,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Herbert Sveinbjörnsson","original_name":"Herbert Sveinbjörnsson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d91c3a36847f826811b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":59991,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Herbert Sveinbjörnsson","original_name":"Herbert Sveinbjörnsson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d91c3a36847f826810f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3928855,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gunnar Sigurðsson","original_name":"Gunnar Sigurðsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f16612a24c5000800bd22d","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3928851,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hildur Margrétardóttir","original_name":"Hildur Margrétardóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f165aa4a4bfc00b2f95c49","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3928857,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jenny Westergard","original_name":"Jenny Westergard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f1663aa67254008202fb1c","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582637,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tore Tomter","original_name":"Tore Tomter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f16644524978007cb7e16b","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3928859,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Todd","original_name":"Michael Todd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f16662a67254007de89e6c","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3248362,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gábor Buczkó","original_name":"Gábor Buczkó","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f16691a24c5000a13c9b23","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3681605,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heather Millard","original_name":"Heather Millard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f165dacaaca200892e2607","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3928858,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jóhanna Jóhannsdóttir","original_name":"Jóhanna Jóhannsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f16652a24c5000d4e371be","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1161456,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Huldar Freyr Arnarson","original_name":"Huldar Freyr Arnarson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f1668652497800964211da","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3928851,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hildur Margrétardóttir","original_name":"Hildur Margrétardóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f1657ca6725400a3a2aaef","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":59991,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Herbert Sveinbjörnsson","original_name":"Herbert Sveinbjörnsson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f165a24a4bfc008ece23ec","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sveinn M.
