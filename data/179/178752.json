Standing alongside a tree-lined farmhouse, two children who are about ten and four years old toss grain to a flock of about 50 domesticated ducks. A woman watches them briefly and then moves on. The older girl has her grain in a bucket, the younger one's grain is in her apron. The children stay in one spot, as does the camera; it's the ducks that move around. Chickens are in the background; only one braves the ducks' territory.","popularity":0.182,"poster_path":"/jHXiJB2ZKzzGctAAsaZVsQRpQHi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumière","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1896-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Lumière Film Catalogue no. 14","title":"Poultry-Yard","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Baromfiudvar","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Lumière","original_name":"Louis Lumière","popularity":0.2875,"profile_path":"/1Hh4lEqRWOrB4kybXJF6JdCchy.jpg","credit_id":"5e350aad98f1f1001803837a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1867,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Auguste Lumière","original_name":"Auguste Lumière","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e350abeac8e6b0015c3394b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Lumière","original_name":"Louis Lumière","popularity":0.2875,"profile_path":"/1Hh4lEqRWOrB4kybXJF6JdCchy.jpg","credit_id":"5faea6257ecd28003eba5ad3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0257008","wikidata_id":"Q112628928","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1364,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jHXiJB2ZKzzGctAAsaZVsQRpQHi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":909},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lsVhafoI0zfZgzT9PkLAm39nuIo.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":945,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tqUuGevxKAJmAo4wKNpLssvxYy3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":218050,"name":"poultry"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1896-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
