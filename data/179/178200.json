Α cinematic pastiche made of testaments on the Greek underground scene of the 60s and 70s, the psychedelic influence in the visual arts and the avant-garde fusion of beat and surrealism in poetry. It is a film about a group of Greek artists and publishers that remained sometimes unseen and sometimes underground, and their personal statement in their effort to change the world with the power of art.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/5WeK7kvF3vsDXkjvSxCDSrYMhad.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voices from the Greek Underground","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giannis Haritidis","original_name":"Γιάννης Χαριτίδης","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d91c3a36847f82680d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5WeK7kvF3vsDXkjvSxCDSrYMhad.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":561}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
