Bright spot lights dot the night, sometimes shining on her window. She sharpens pencils and writes on a page in a copy book. The pencil point often breaks under her fingers' force.

Is she writing to her husband? \"Sweetheart, come.\"","popularity":0.3127,"poster_path":"/uDHXwFNiojhO5CRN5EfkP5N9i43.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pipeline Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Absentia","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":25,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1180551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlene Kaminsky","original_name":"Marlene Kaminsky","popularity":0.2286,"profile_path":"/gwCHXxsfVXF5PL7cjJDkjkcgK4i.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"52fe4d97c3a36847f826944b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3188632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathinka Pasveer","original_name":"Kathinka Pasveer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Female voice","credit_id":"610d5f15dcf87500303ea985","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206804,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karlheinz Stockhausen","original_name":"Karlheinz Stockhausen","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/pUCmDaVAzjSfkapFAFT7AwEMSqr.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Male voice","credit_id":"610d5f25931ea10046b2f969","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Quay","original_name":"Timothy Quay","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/8hGRmypiLEoj4fYGa55kcq01z5s.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d97c3a36847f8269441","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Quay","original_name":"Stephen Quay","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":"/9Z8YMbCDR1xzNwfXdq2IQyUjnHy.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d97c3a36847f8269447","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206804,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karlheinz Stockhausen","original_name":"Karlheinz Stockhausen","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/pUCmDaVAzjSfkapFAFT7AwEMSqr.jpg","credit_id":"610d5ee87719d7004579eb18","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206804,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karlheinz Stockhausen","original_name":"Karlheinz Stockhausen","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/pUCmDaVAzjSfkapFAFT7AwEMSqr.jpg","credit_id":"610d5f50ee43e8005e46b389","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50113,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Stockhausen","original_name":"Simon Stockhausen","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610d5f5e4cbe120081915fa3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3188637,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pinky Ghundale","original_name":"Pinky Ghundale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610d5f8e4cbe12004b443094","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2687979,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Ian Nicholas","original_name":"Ian Nicholas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610d5faadcf87500303eaa93","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2583435,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Seidel","original_name":"Christian Seidel","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610d5ff97719d70072c9d51a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0266643","wikidata_id":"Q11163075","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d8yQ2OFQn8z6BXjto3uNULVqOaD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uDHXwFNiojhO5CRN5EfkP5N9i43.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4nHETajMIAz6gVqSdwlMWvCZg7k.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oTQWbS267ICHei8BVGS43uAlWwU.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jVN4w4IjUCyGx1WbHAvFMPZrFSK.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
