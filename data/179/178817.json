Their romance spans the time period from his days of glory with Babe Ruth and the New York Yankees to his unsuccessful battle with an incurable disease. As the story begins, the talented but shy Gehrig is already a popular Yankee slugger when he meets the outgoing Eleanor. Their romance begins hesitantly, but blossoms as they exchange letters while Gehrig is on the road with the team. However, Gehrig's possessive mother becomes a formidable obstacle, first to their marriage and later to their happiness. But their love for one another proves triumphant. In the midst of their happiness, when Gehrig is at the peak of his career, he learns that he is suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The courage and dignity exhibited by the Gehrigs during this crisis make this a powerful, memorable film.","popularity":2.7733,"poster_path":"/uG9jAnxGhB4tat5AkvZXrUGLIEW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1502,"logo_path":"/ywjcvHUiKxv7cYsestkONF8LieH.png","name":"NBC","origin_country":"US"},{"id":19683,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charles Fries Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":41564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stonehenge Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Love Affair: The Eleanor and Lou Gehrig Story","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blythe Danner","original_name":"Blythe Danner","popularity":0.6053,"profile_path":"/xIN3nX76b4qN8B32wdoqx053N68.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Eleanor Gehrig","credit_id":"52fe4d9cc3a36847f826a691","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Herrmann","original_name":"Edward Herrmann","popularity":1.0067,"profile_path":"/sO9IoAlw3CLJZT6UF35cZBcTYRV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lou Gehrig","credit_id":"52fe4d9cc3a36847f826a695","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald S.
