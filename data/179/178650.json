On this live set, Gino chooses songs from eight of his nine previous albums, in addition to one tune from a subsequent release; therefore, he wisely covers his whole career. Live In Montreal CD music Included are his three Top 40 hits: \"Living Inside Myself,\" \"People Gotta Move\" and \"I Just Wanna Stop.\" Gino and his three piece band bring new life to three tunes that were on the lackluster Big Dreamers Never Sleep, especially the acoustic arrangement of \"Something Tells Me.\" Guitarist Mike Miller is a great, while Enzo Todesco is a monster drummer, who goes wild on the drum-intensive opener - \"Brother To Brother.\" Although some songs are a little overdone, this is a very good live showcase of Gino's performing and songwriting talents.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gino Vannelli Live in Montréal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
