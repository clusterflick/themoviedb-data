The completed Technicolor film was destroyed by the director in fear that it would be used as propaganda against the ousted monarchy. Following Mahmoud Sabit, the man who found the original 8mm reels and who is himself a relation of the late king of Egypt, this documentary focuses on the reconstruction of the film's story, its array of real life players, and the political circumstances surrounding the shoot. This uncanny marriage of fiction and reality reveals that the original film not only managed to unwittingly predict the fate of the King, but also foresaw the next 60 years of relations between Egypt and the West.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":37147,"logo_path":"/qsTp5jprmkanKioff9iIrI68vO6.png","name":"Middle West Films","origin_country":"EG"},{"id":37148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sarakene","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Search of Oil and Sand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380916,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rasha El Gammal","original_name":"Rasha El Gammal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5456418a0e0a2648d20075d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Dib","original_name":"Philippe Dib","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54564176c3a368607500026d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":73667,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Golia","original_name":"David Golia","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54564235c3a368147c00718f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3030258,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wael Omar","original_name":"Wael Omar","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/9spOYi3Rg5yDbwmFtZVvJkcPgfz.jpg","credit_id":"63b8219224b33300931bc3b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2417934","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
