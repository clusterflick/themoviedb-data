One would-be sale has them carrying the machine up a large flight of steps, only to find out that a young lady wants them to post a letter for her. The boys later get into an argument knocking off each other's hats, which eventually involves scores of others. A police van eventually carts all those involved away except Stan and Ollie, who afterwards try to find their own headgear amongst the hundreds of others lying on the street.","popularity":0.5553,"poster_path":"/ePlAXf9erXUsvjOf4zNjpzTlTQs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hats Off","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stan Laurel","original_name":"Stan Laurel","popularity":0.5677,"profile_path":"/eT15ERUT5T3CVyf2a9JD1VAzC6q.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Stan","credit_id":"589ace5ec3a3683aaa0043bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Hardy","original_name":"Oliver Hardy","popularity":1.0454,"profile_path":"/qRMGQo5oWwcLpwgXSoArXK5riwe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ollie","credit_id":"589ace6c925141238d003c10","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Garvin","original_name":"Anita Garvin","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":"/gOPMlk1i6yhCSZxpqVwIAaW4IS7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Customer at top of stairs","credit_id":"589ace86925141238d003c20","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Coburn","original_name":"Dorothy Coburn","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/bSLqRYqeSvZz103VEgU3j8ggBTa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vision","credit_id":"589ace989251412384004583","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Finlayson","original_name":"James Finlayson","popularity":0.3658,"profile_path":"/mKzmqNW32JgFYICiQfEFK5m8b8s.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Proprietor, Kwickway Washing Machine Co.","credit_id":"589aceb0925141238400458d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chet Brandenburg","original_name":"Chet Brandenburg","popularity":0.1579,"profile_path":"/eqfca5056LyAPwYwRGdUow9cH3o.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Pedestrian","credit_id":"589acecb9251412387004128","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Lufkin","original_name":"Sam Lufkin","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Pedestrian","credit_id":"589aced5925141238a003fd0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ham Kinsey","original_name":"Ham Kinsey","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/sQxDJcLmPRRNF4lQzp8KRGBIsQI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pedestrian","credit_id":"589acee2c3a3683aa6003e77","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131383,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"H.M.
