But Shashikanta Sengupta, an eccentric lawyer, stubbornly refuses to leave his motherland. Widower Shashikanta has two children, Minoti and Bidyut. Anuprava Devi is an affectionate old aunt who lives with the family. The family has a house in Narail, a small provincial town on the bank of the Chitra river. Some Muslim neighbors eye Shashaikanta's house. But the family refuse to migrate. Shashikanta's children Minoti and Bidyut are friends with the neighboring Muslim children- Badal, Salma and Nazma. Minoti and Badal become more than friends. The children grow up.","popularity":0.3691,"poster_path":"/nhcCRxRVWoGND46jSAqFBnbH30x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95610,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kino-Eye Films","origin_country":"BD"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","name":"Bangladesh"}],"release_date":"1998-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Quiet Flows the River Chitra","title":"Chitra Nodir Pare","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","title":"Chitra Nodir Pare","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Momtajuddin Ahmed","original_name":"Momtajuddin Ahmed","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Lawyer Shashikanto Sengupta","credit_id":"589a0ab09251410d8c0008ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1752837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Afsana Mimi","original_name":"Afsana Mimi","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/63pxYGGSS59A51GHnkY5bn8t4r5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Minoti","credit_id":"589a0ac2c3a36801ec000875","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":994346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tauquir Ahmed","original_name":"Tauquir Ahmed","popularity":0.2451,"profile_path":"/fBT5QkDNkzGN9Cppgt1L5qvU6QL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Badal","credit_id":"589a0ad5c3a36801da0008a3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1752839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rawshan Zamil","original_name":"Rawshan Zamil","popularity":2.6277,"profile_path":"/6LzLAQ3aKWQCqEqNO7gBUxCzjyU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Anuprova Devi","credit_id":"589a0ae3c3a36801e7000898","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":994368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nazmul Huda Bachchu","original_name":"Nazmul Huda Bachchu","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nimai Babu","credit_id":"589a0aed9251410d8e0008c8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amirul Haque Chowdhury","original_name":"Amirul Haque Chowdhury","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Shamsuddin Lawyer","credit_id":"589a0b01c3a36801dd0007d0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramendu Majumdar","original_name":"Ramendu Majumdar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Comrade Jotin","credit_id":"589a0b14c3a36801f1000857","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Syed Akhtar Ali","original_name":"Syed Akhtar Ali","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bijoy barber","credit_id":"589a0b349251410d93000999","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752843,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Uttam Guho","original_name":"Uttam Guho","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Madman","credit_id":"589a0b3dc3a36801f70008ca","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahsanul Haq Minu","original_name":"Ahsanul Haq Minu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Shafique","credit_id":"589a0b499251410d9a00091b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"S.M.
