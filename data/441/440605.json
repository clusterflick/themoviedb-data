Currently retired, he takes care of his extravagant and almost hundred-year-old illiterate mother. He writes poems and hopes to see them published one day. The other, a declared womanizer, workaholic, and leftist, was imprisoned during the dictatorship, runs a small grocery shop, and controls the life of his young second wife. Both were born in the Uruguayan hinterland during the Second World War, and share the same name as well as the fact that neither has wished to change it. The film is a tragicomic portrait of a country whose cultural diversity, its peculiar history and the character of its inhabitants allow the existence of exceptional and remarkable persons that depict a live picture of Uruguay, with its plurality and contradictions, its small and large history, without departing a single moment from irony or reflection.","popularity":0.1495,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2007-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Hitlers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812610,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Márquez","original_name":"Daniel Márquez","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fc5591fd140b004642c459","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812610,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Márquez","original_name":"Daniel Márquez","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fc55f717792c002d74e276","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2326642,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Diego Varela","original_name":"Diego Varela","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6102229c0a517c0027aec68d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2326642,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Diego Varela","original_name":"Diego Varela","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610222a622931a005c4b025b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922208,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hugo Jasa","original_name":"Hugo Jasa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610222c50cd32a002fd5ada0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176982,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hernán Baigorria","original_name":"Hernán Baigorria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610222d422931a007223c892","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":486330,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pedro Luque","original_name":"Pedro Luque","popularity":0.2464,"profile_path":"/wGTUWK6NfxfdImLAdQySB5AimD9.jpg","credit_id":"610222e20cd32a007f22a8bc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":486330,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pedro Luque","original_name":"Pedro Luque","popularity":0.2464,"profile_path":"/wGTUWK6NfxfdImLAdQySB5AimD9.jpg","credit_id":"610222eca84a47005f1f9080","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3170368,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlos \"Kico\" Márquez","original_name":"Carlos \"Kico\" Márquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610222fbdb72c0005d8c231a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1753917,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ana Tipa","original_name":"Ana Tipa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589bfbe5c3a3684cf0002f0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1676353,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mario Jacob","original_name":"Mario Jacob","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":"/qJYnxArrqoG42t2ioFQfww0M9Wq.jpg","credit_id":"589bfbfc925141260600307a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1753917,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ana Tipa","original_name":"Ana Tipa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589bfc5ec3a3684cda00340b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m5npap1neu0kLbJBmW0aTBSFJf2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
