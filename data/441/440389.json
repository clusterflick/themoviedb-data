Based on a poem by Zofia Bohdanowiczowa.","popularity":0.0982,"poster_path":"/ib4HXNIlb40xXwkU7pCaLIdLPLb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Evening","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1688651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofia Bohdanowicz","original_name":"Sofia Bohdanowicz","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/z7SXORpBTrGfSiD5ZCaI5HlhgOw.jpg","credit_id":"589a9548c3a3683aa3002691","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679079,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aaron Mirkin","original_name":"Aaron Mirkin","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de3ee783faba000190d92f5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5987208","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2083,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ib4HXNIlb40xXwkU7pCaLIdLPLb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1389},{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":1314,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/flcmNdSLntKhLolLRQRluj8Z7wk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Museum of the Moving Image: First Look","release_date":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
