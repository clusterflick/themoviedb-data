He stole their smiles - sly, playful, tender, affectionate - and melted them into golden bells! The Miracle dungeon was filled with a quiet, clear ringing sound, fresh and transparent, like a forest spring. He enjoyed this music, but the people in the city looked at each other with sad eyes and thought that joy had left them forever. But one day a cheerful company came to this city - a kind wizard, a girl Katya, a boy Vasya and a cartoon cat that came to life - and helped the residents return their smiles.","popularity":0.0859,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magic Bells","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1789106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksey Solovyov","original_name":"Алексей Соловьев","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662bb34ac1ffbd011d6c276e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22941970","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
