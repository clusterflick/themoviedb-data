Sergei is sensitive and introspective; he truly cares about his family, community and treats nature with the utmost respect. He loves the independence and freedom this life brings, despite the immense sacrifices that it necessitates, such as total isolation and being a stranger to his own children. Spectacular camerawork characterizes the Sakha horses in all their magnificence, and juxtaposes the post-soviet towns and the boundless taiga landscapes, where the cold bites through the screen.","popularity":0.5024,"poster_path":"/dULfu04ZGGiWFlEv3wdvQhPFwG9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Muus Khaia Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"24 Snow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"24 sniegi","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"24 snega","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Barynin","original_name":"Mikhail Barynin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605281e9a2d2e90054fa056a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Barynin","original_name":"Mikhail Barynin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5899bcb7c3a36842550044f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752629,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yuri Berezhnev","original_name":"Yuri Berezhnev","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5899bccc92514113d9004354","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752630,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Semen Amanatov","original_name":"Semen Amanatov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/kFbdV0is2LGWL9ICTzqYrkVWkBB.jpg","credit_id":"5899bcedc3a368425b0043be","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752631,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mikhail Kardashevskyi","original_name":"Mikhail Kardashevskyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5899bd00c3a36842690046be","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752632,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nikita Koltsev","original_name":"Nikita Koltsev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5899bd2292514113c60048af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752633,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Innokenty Sivtsev","original_name":"Innokenty Sivtsev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5899bd3992514113cf0045d3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752633,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Innokenty Sivtsev","original_name":"Innokenty Sivtsev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5899bd60c3a36842570045d2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752634,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Egor Makarov","original_name":"Egor Makarov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5899bd78c3a368425b004403","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752634,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Egor Makarov","original_name":"Egor Makarov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5899bd9292514113d90043b5","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6116236","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/lYyH2Dg33dht8ZGO4UaTHv2mSlw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dULfu04ZGGiWFlEv3wdvQhPFwG9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1533,"name":"isolation"},{"id":8721,"name":"arctic polar circle region"},{"id":232397,"name":"sakha"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sputnik Russian Film Festival","release_date":"2016-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2016-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"16+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"24 SNOW film trailer (ENG) / 24 СНЕГА","key":"rB4-DnDpoq4","published_at":"2015-05-25T09:34:50.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5899bf0c92514113c100478d"}]}}}
