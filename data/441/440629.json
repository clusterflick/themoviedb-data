Here are all the most important gods: mighty Zeus, his treacherous wife Hera, handsome singer Apollo, ruler of the seas Poseidon, warrior Ares, goddess of beauty and love Aphrodite and wise Athena. Here is the illegitimate son of Zeus, Hercules - a demigod-half-man. Having missed the Earth, he begs for travel on it from Zeus before sunrise. He is accompanied by an eagle - a cunning and insinuating creature, the same one who once pecked Prometheus and from which Hercules saved him. On Earth, Hercules enters the temple dedicated to him and his twelve feats. There he remembers some of them.","popularity":0.3535,"poster_path":"/r4A6FITWRZwZ40RihqLTq2U9ssg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14599,"logo_path":"/hz8piJ9Np1MswUyav0JDNGf42pO.png","name":"Soyuzmultfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1969-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return from Olympus","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Vozvrashchenie s Olimpa","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Η επιστροφή από τον 'Ολυμπο","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erast Garin","original_name":"Эраст Гарин","popularity":0.3496,"profile_path":"/raIMkUi8DYycBT8Hr8R57h1N1jM.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"594ba96cc3a368327900fa1b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksei Gribov","original_name":"Алексей Грибов","popularity":0.1877,"profile_path":"/kzWJpDis4YDsBEAqYcVYuho2X8S.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"594ba988c3a36832ca00f9f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":301980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalya Kustinskaya","original_name":"Наталья Кустинская","popularity":0.1709,"profile_path":"/vxts2mbtDq5bjN2m6GRtlufH8Pl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"594ba9d7c3a368327900fa72","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1745423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Pogorzhelsky","original_name":"Михаил Погоржельский","popularity":0.1841,"profile_path":"/fsrrFXpjQInIZ5gg2gbIPWdMzPm.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5b13f2649251416701012f89","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1837374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofya Zajkova","original_name":"Sofya Zajkova","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"594ba9c5c3a368329b010fba","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2227553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Novokhizhin","original_name":"Mikhail Novokhizhin","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"594ba9ce925141311100feb2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksey Konsovskiy","original_name":"Алексей Консовский","popularity":0.1878,"profile_path":"/4vZ1ybH9lDDDil8amdmDoujQ9gT.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"59641c16c3a36825e80ecb0c","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565313,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aleksey Simukov","original_name":"Алексей Симуков","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":"/6kscaileoeOURiOQGoFjUkuv2iX.jpg","credit_id":"594ba9fec3a36832ca00fa6e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":565307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksandra Snezhko-Blotskaya","original_name":"Александра Снежко-Блоцкая","popularity":0.1307,"profile_path":"/ctQi9rrn8aI4Xau0YVLUe7VqyzE.jpg","credit_id":"59d6bee3925141251f000dba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5059802","wikidata_id":"Q4114684","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/r4A6FITWRZwZ40RihqLTq2U9ssg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2036,"name":"greek mythology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1969-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
