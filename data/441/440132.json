She’s not the only one interested in him: her sociologist father Roberto Carri wrote a book on him called “Pre-Revolutionary Forms of Violence” and a film was made about his story, although both father and film disappeared during the Dirty War. Legends, families, political alignments, cinema: none offer a stable foothold and Carri’s passage through them is like wandering a garden of forking paths, only to arrive at a landscape of cracked earth and thorns.","popularity":0.2561,"poster_path":"/4ZcVaQ2slANbKsrDTN6co57Kwhx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6458,"logo_path":"/eT4oMUK7ODM0vvZue8yq3Ojwqf8.png","name":"INCAA","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":11999,"logo_path":"/50K9W66YeWjOalNcjWddPcSgIYO.png","name":"Universidad
