She wields her uniform, beret and black handbag like a protective shield, which her daily work desperately requires. More or less on her own, she runs a small police unit dedicated to protecting women who’ve been raped and children who’ve suffered abuse in the war-plagued regions of the Congo. At the start of Maman Colonelle, she’s transferred from Bukavu to Kisangani, arriving only to discover her future home and office in a desolate state. While she deals with such practical obstacles with suitable feistiness, the traumas and social deformities of the people around her have nightmarish dimensions: the envy surrounding those with state-recognised ‘victim’ status, hope for help from the ‘whites’, depression, helplessness.","popularity":0.1756,"poster_path":"/xh0vy7BeMlGFUAvwcwNGUWfqfHw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CD","name":"Congo"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lingala","iso_639_1":"ln","name":""},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mama Colonel","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5323403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Honorine Munyole","original_name":"Honorine Munyole","popularity":0.1068,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67e03152210fa80a0f4da47b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1353901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dieudo Hamadi","original_name":"Dieudo Hamadi","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/2gWI2WxRPlJK6Q103WCCQ2SnAJH.jpg","credit_id":"58991a22c3a36867ab00194d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2034104,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anne Renardet","original_name":"Anne Renardet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c91ea3c9251410f93a038f0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1353901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dieudo Hamadi","original_name":"Dieudo Hamadi","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/2gWI2WxRPlJK6Q103WCCQ2SnAJH.jpg","credit_id":"5c91ea65c3a368611f526dca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1904535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Lelong","original_name":"Christian Lelong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d4626d00bbfe6a7553cfec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kiripi Katembo Siku","original_name":"Kiripi Katembo Siku","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d4627ebf4818854c6516a2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5323406,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"François Tariq Sardi","original_name":"François Tariq Sardi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e03205c0b4387a6ec723c0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7133098","wikidata_id":"Q56302301","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ungUrx5rQVHpTGUWKkUcD2b6tEJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ldgxc3kCRlrjEvkDCSyigeMbkxK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xh0vy7BeMlGFUAvwcwNGUWfqfHw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":2480,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hsAtln4cgODulgcWPQu6nziRWy4.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1748}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hot Docs 2017 Trailers: MAMA COLONEL","key":"MFHrqsH7dMQ","published_at":"2017-03-21T15:03:15.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"596353d292514121f00d49e9"}]}}}
