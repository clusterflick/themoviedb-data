At the center of that island is a giant baobab tree, which produces many eggs each day. Inside the eggs are food, clothing, and other daily necessities. The inhabitants of the island live carefree lives, dependent upon the eggs.  But lately, more and more of the eggs have been turning up empty, which makes the inhabitants uneasy. Then one day, with a thunderous crash, and an explosion of rainbow-colored light, the baobab tree produces an egg of curious appearance. The next morning, the village chief Poncho tells the inhabitants that they must find that egg. Now the tiger Kometora and a group of children must find the egg within the forest.","popularity":0.4357,"poster_path":"/eoqQ2yJ7Awp06EgbRNP6dp2AYRz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69265,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Comet","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Charanpo Land Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Charanpo Shima no Monogatari","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Charanpo Land no Bōken","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2559493,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Reiji Kasuga","original_name":"春日礼児","popularity":0.1381,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6389c0ee3f8ede00792682c0","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1516274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shin Misawa","original_name":"三沢伸","popularity":0.276,"profile_path":"/qYQmxVTHOU9aGg1p43iC3W3dpJ2.jpg","credit_id":"589c8e35c3a3684cf900a6a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vJ9FsLeVFyZ9xGp1iPhHLzyEA8W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/eoqQ2yJ7Awp06EgbRNP6dp2AYRz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":210024,"name":"anime"},{"id":210904,"name":"young animator training project"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
