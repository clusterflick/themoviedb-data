Her unemployed father finds structure and purpose in daily life by caring for his horses, while her sick mother wistfully remembers the days when she used to turn heads as she galloped through the town. These days it's Lorna who likes to spend all her free time in the stable or riding Bigfoot, her horse.","popularity":0.3882,"poster_path":"/ftY0QQp1bQLHAde196tWIq1serC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112669,"logo_path":null,"name":"Systerskaparna
