Adam Plachetka is his occasionally unruly servant Leporello. It’s when Giovanni tangles with Donna Anna (Hibla Gerzmava) that things start to unravel, aided by the reappearance of Donna Elvira (Malin Byström), who is determined not to let her seducer go. With Paul Appleby as Don Ottavio, Donna Anna’s eternally steadfast fiancé. Principal Conductor Fabio Luisi leads the Met Orchestra and Chorus.","popularity":0.7901,"poster_path":"/nmMDwkqxURQVtPWmXQPkSscT2i4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan
