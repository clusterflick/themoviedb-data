The story unfolds in the tension between Robert E. Peary, the American who spent 23 years among the polar Eskimos in order to conquer the North Pole, and Minik, the sole survivor out of six Eskimos, who were put on the New York exhibition in 1897 by Peary. In the film's contemporary scenes, the young polar Eskimo Robert E. Peary II, a great-grandchild of the Arctic explorer, goes on an expedition into his ancestors' past, which takes him from Greenland to America. It changes Robert's view on himself and his family history forever.","popularity":0.0927,"poster_path":"/qnJ2bXLrrEHUuRhWJkLurtUXpSe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eden Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2006-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prize of the Pole","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Peary","original_name":"Robert Peary","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"59e8b875c3a368734e00fb52","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1613709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Staffan Julén","original_name":"Staffan Julén","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/As7NHkKkz2CKJVSvpfTsVGESAeB.jpg","credit_id":"59e8b884c3a368282e011b77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1613709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Staffan Julén","original_name":"Staffan Julén","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/As7NHkKkz2CKJVSvpfTsVGESAeB.jpg","credit_id":"59e8b89c9251414af8012e24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327388,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Torben Forsberg","original_name":"Torben Forsberg","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/iFLoF4SVvLuakDfvN6TFiUyyhGi.jpg","credit_id":"59e8b8b29251414af8012e47","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1546095,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Camilla Hjelm Knudsen","original_name":"Camilla Hjelm","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/sO8WkvPQA11TdCuaNjZfToJcgSj.jpg","credit_id":"670f9fae01c85c4fd81a5a1a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0910940","wikidata_id":"Q20729626","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fZdYAQXBdppIndFuZ9c7eLwYTfj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qnJ2bXLrrEHUuRhWJkLurtUXpSe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1333},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/su9vXODFw5KB5VeURk6I8NsZRVo.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
