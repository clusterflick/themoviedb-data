Peter Wiggenstein turned to the men of the five island families around him and warned: \"Tell nothing of this\" as the men all looked at the body of their former Reverend--gunned down just outside his own home--and a decision was made. They secretly buried the body on Graves Island, and the reign of America's first and only king ended; but for every end, there is always a new beginning, for an evil was born that night. Five families have always controlled the Island. Five families share the Island's fortune; five families share its curse.","popularity":0.8733,"poster_path":"/iVl8t8SG1Z5uXoa79a2pQOMD87y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elder Island
