Burke decides to ask Higgins to close his business on Sunday, but Higgins only concern is to find a baritone to sing in the saloon's quartet, and has his henchies toss Ted out into the street. Ted decides to fight fire with fire, so he gathers up the down-and-out vaudeville act of Chase &amp; Chase (who don't take long to show why they are down and out) and knife-thrower Steve Clemente, and a dozen or so western musicians from Gower Gulch as the before-the-sermon at his tabernacle. Higgins sends his rowdies over to bust up the Sunday morning competition.","popularity":0.5081,"poster_path":"/gB7gjNiNk4KdILs5dHKdXRdvmjU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1936-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sunday Round-Up","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Foran","original_name":"Dick Foran","popularity":0.3265,"profile_path":"/aPw9QMtlx1SwRBTQdKuaziNrZyb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Parson Ted Burke","credit_id":"589c5ae49251412604008a69","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1021799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Perry","original_name":"Linda Perry","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/4juf3CE0ZVc3w34TU5yoPQ9waax.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mary Lou","credit_id":"589c5af69251412537004830","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Wyman","original_name":"Jane Wyman","popularity":0.7495,"profile_path":"/A5aHswRznZbCzbU4aD4lJ1r1J62.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Butte Soule","credit_id":"589c5b06925141245e004e5f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Cobb","original_name":"Edmund Cobb","popularity":0.2406,"profile_path":"/icnYHc5GwjZzl9wF2nLP8rPvL8a.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jack Higgins","credit_id":"589c5b17c3a36877340039d8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Strange","original_name":"Glenn Strange","popularity":0.5104,"profile_path":"/6SPVOqbKTSt3NA6OzoXJsjJTucc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Master of Ceremonies","credit_id":"589c5b26c3a3686e280048a7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Hubert","original_name":"Fritz Hubert","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Chase","credit_id":"589c5b34c3a3686e280048b3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1754032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Hubert","original_name":"Jean Hubert","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Chase","credit_id":"589c5b46925141254b004ac9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Clemente","original_name":"Steve Clemente","popularity":0.2697,"profile_path":"/ghpLqUxVQHCdrtOwGh7s4oGvpVz.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Steve Clemente - Knife Thrower","credit_id":"589c5b55c3a3684ce200889b","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Clemens","original_name":"William Clemens","popularity":0.1126,"profile_path":"/A4WvNlwswhAea9dpxVlBUvgN2Dr.jpg","credit_id":"589c5a77c3a3686ef9004556","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0345972","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gB7gjNiNk4KdILs5dHKdXRdvmjU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
