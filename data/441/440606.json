Only one year earlier, not even the boldest observer would have dared predict such a possibility. After one hundred days of digging, the earth reveals its secret: the first remains appear. The documentary reconstructs the process that cuts the country’s history in two: before and after.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":86321,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aceituna Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2010-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las manos en la tierra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477439,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Virginia Martínez","original_name":"Virginia Martínez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589bfdd7925141260a0032ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477439,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Virginia Martínez","original_name":"Virginia Martínez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589bff3b92514126010035c6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":569201,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gonzalo Arijón","original_name":"Gonzalo Arijón","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589bff5dc3a3684cda003659","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1732679","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Biarritz Latin Film Festival","release_date":"2010-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
