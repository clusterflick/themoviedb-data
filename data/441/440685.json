Bernick is engaged to marry Johan's sister, who is an heiress. He is simply marring her for her money, as he is really in love with the wife of an actor. While on a visit to his old love, in which he hopes to break off the affair, the woman's husband unexpectedly enters the room, and Bernick is compelled to escape by the window. Johan, upon learning of his friend's threatened disgrace, assumes Bernick's guilt, and leaves the country for America. Bernick takes advantage of his friend's chivalry by allowing it to be generally believed that Johan also misappropriated funds. In reality, Bernick was guilty of this crime as well as the other.","popularity":0.0633,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pillars of Society","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Faust","original_name":"Martin Faust","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/762htr0QR2o6R6AHOwdO0b5POw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Johan","credit_id":"5eac3c86c8a2d4001f4aee23","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia M.
