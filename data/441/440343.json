Eighteen years after he was sent overseas by his suffering mother (Wong), the son (Cheung) of an affluent household returns as a shadow of himself – both physically and spiritually – before unwittingly falling for his philandering father’s illegitimate daughter (Ha), conceived through the rape of a housemaid. No doubt ironically titled, Motherhood presents a restrained subversion of the Cantonese family melodrama tradition.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motherhood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tso Kea","original_name":"Tso Kea","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589a3c2cc3a3683a38001440","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0492580","wikidata_id":"Q23705701","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
