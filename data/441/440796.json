I’m shot up with so much cortisone I feel like the Hulk.” Even when he’s not feeling the greatest, the singer-songwriter’s unique sense of humor remains perfectly intact.\r Opening with the lead single from his eponymous album, ‘Gimme Something Good,’ the concert featured tunes from throughout Adams’ career, including both solo and Cardinals material. For those lucky fans in attendance — and the thousands who were watching at home via iTunes — Adams did an amazing job of putting new spins on familiar tunes; this was evident in the opening of ‘Fix It’ and ‘Let It Ride,’ both of which never lost their original appeal, but featured subtly different arrangements.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ryan Adams: Live at Itunes Festival 2014","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ab","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
