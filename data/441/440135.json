A prologue examines three buildings from the 1930s designed by Julio Vilamajó in Montevideo which could have inspired the work of Eladio Dieste, the subject of the main part of the film. The industrial and functional buildings presented span the period from 1955 to 1994; their organic brick construction is astonishing and inspiring.","popularity":0.0936,"poster_path":"/iXdwycGTb426h8wf5Ogr8PD0UDh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17178,"logo_path":"/eXbcwmrHmVmgmRFPoYZfbLkt884.png","name":"Filmgalerie 451","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dieste [Uruguay]","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Emigholz","original_name":"Heinz Emigholz","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":"/lHMPlkrIiRGV5j1uQyTEON0lhVl.jpg","credit_id":"589917fc92514164720018f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1378020,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Till Beckmann","original_name":"Till Beckmann","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4c016a0e0a26453b03338f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Emigholz","original_name":"Heinz Emigholz","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":"/lHMPlkrIiRGV5j1uQyTEON0lhVl.jpg","credit_id":"5b4c018b9251417d0d029927","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Emigholz","original_name":"Heinz Emigholz","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":"/lHMPlkrIiRGV5j1uQyTEON0lhVl.jpg","credit_id":"5b4c017d0e0a26453202f2d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1378020,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Till Beckmann","original_name":"Till Beckmann","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4c01709251417d2002fa6c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Emigholz","original_name":"Heinz Emigholz","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":"/lHMPlkrIiRGV5j1uQyTEON0lhVl.jpg","credit_id":"5b4c0184c3a36823d802c192","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9737102","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1397,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iXdwycGTb426h8wf5Ogr8PD0UDh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":990},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sJcMWp4CnPw2bAnbSTkn3b13riU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
