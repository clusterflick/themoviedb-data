This was a cause for mass rallies in Belgrade and other cities in Serbia. The film documents the protests during the first four days of their protests, their political and criticising charge but also the carnival spirit. On the seventh day of the protests the film was edited and had a premiere screening in the Rex Cinema.","popularity":0.5622,"poster_path":"/8Tc976BRvym9g6FASa5l1vng24l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radio B92","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1996-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Throwing Off the Yolks of Bondage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Želimir Žilnik","original_name":"Želimir Žilnik","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/iRED1Q2iwyXkmh2odTAbOotZGQc.jpg","credit_id":"589c038cc3a3684cda003bb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Želimir Žilnik","original_name":"Želimir Žilnik","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/iRED1Q2iwyXkmh2odTAbOotZGQc.jpg","credit_id":"589c03a7c3a3684ce500399d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1753947,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Slavica Lalić","original_name":"Slavica Lalić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589c03dc9251412612003d81","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikola Majdak Jr.","original_name":"Nikola Majdak Jr.","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589c0426c3a3684ce900383c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1753948,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nenad Mladenović","original_name":"Nenad Mladenović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589c04499251412601003e3e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1753949,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aca Kostić","original_name":"Aca Kostić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589c04689251412606003c2a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8206420","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Tc976BRvym9g6FASa5l1vng24l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":186576,"name":"protest march"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
