I’m just a girl.\" This disturbing scene sets the tone for this film about Alicia, who was taken away from her teenage mother by the Child Welfare Bureau when she was 12 months old. She’s been living in an orphanage since the age of five, and they have never managed to find a foster family for her. In Alicia, we watch as she becomes a teenager, still craving safety and love. Over the course of three years, filmmaker Maasja Ooms follows her daily life up close. Alicia's yearning and powerlessness are palpable in these observations, which painfully reveal the effects of having no prospects.","popularity":0.4047,"poster_path":"/nNtQz2fLNQAofcBUKK566xitaYP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97710,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cerutti Film","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alicia","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maasja Ooms","original_name":"Maasja Ooms","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a15e69b0e0a2638b7000e29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928152,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Willemijn Cerutti","original_name":"Willemijn Cerutti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a15e6d39251417a830031b5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maasja Ooms","original_name":"Maasja Ooms","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a15e6f80e0a2638bd000f1d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maasja Ooms","original_name":"Maasja Ooms","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a15e7090e0a2638c3000f66","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7704614","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nNtQz2fLNQAofcBUKK566xitaYP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158394,"name":"foster home"},{"id":204134,"name":"human interest"},{"id":239886,"name":"child protection"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
