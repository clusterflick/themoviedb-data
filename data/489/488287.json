A sport that is increasingly popular in the United States, the tour provides these students and the Kiwi teams they battle a rare opportunity to dig beneath the surface of things. On the field, troubled histories melt away, and we see boys rise as men; girls lead as women stronger for facing up to a challenge. 'Red, White, Black and Blue' provides a sensitive take on a rough game: it blends on-field triumph with off-field tragedy. If the spirit of these teens is any indication, the Olympic Rugby Gold Medal - currently held by the United States since it was last an Olympic sport in 1924 - may just be defensible after all.","popularity":0.0545,"poster_path":"/8iMivQU9Cg63hGGqwuC9WP2G0zo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red White Black & Blue Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1927136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Brown","original_name":"James Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1383f4c3a3681156001fb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2428636","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8iMivQU9Cg63hGGqwuC9WP2G0zo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":709}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
