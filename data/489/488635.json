Engaging fictional narrative elements to create a ‘mystery,’ Where is Memory is a boldly original and affecting meditation on the nature of complicity and the Third Reich. Masterful use of archival footage matched with contemporary footage of Europe, a haunting score and an inspired mix of realities for a thoughtfully framed poetic odyssey that charts new cinematic territory.\r — Judges’ Award, Northwest International Film Festival","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bO8Wj8wZFiravRxA62WhByNDxeC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where is Memory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Gallagher","original_name":"Chris Gallagher","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1WuVG70ZOEcDuZJkTlSALLNYNfd.jpg","credit_id":"5a1643a192514153af00382b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016101,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John P.
