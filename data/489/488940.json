Rainy rides along Schönhauser Allee, which seems to be depopulated. Past the 'Viennese Café', the meeting place par excellence. From a moving train the view of idyllic landscapes, on the horizon a castle. The camera tilts, turns, until the world is upside down. Scenes of an action with the artist friend Heike Stephan: in the sanctuary Hahnemann, black painted with a white turban, and Stephan, stack cages with rabbits on top of each other. Then TV recordings of a discussion forum with Jean-Luc Godard and Rosa von Praunheim - scenes as from another planet. From the off again and again a poem Hahnemann, recited by Peter Mario Graus. The diction is initially calm, almost factual, increases, eventually overturns, but then falls back, resigned. \" (Claus Löser in \"Gegenbilder\")","popularity":0.0958,"poster_path":"/7tJCWXNcpEmCkpos4vBr9N8EJms.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"September September","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Luc Godard","original_name":"Jean-Luc Godard","popularity":1.0955,"profile_path":"/zP5EDY5MstfkdBmPXNCj8Y6v5KR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"(archive footage)","credit_id":"65721bb1172d7f014d206433","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosa von Praunheim","original_name":"Rosa von Praunheim","popularity":0.2345,"profile_path":"/8KtgcbZmwtvyjATkPgGCD02GxPw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"(archive footage)","credit_id":"65721bb7f2883800ff40a1fe","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1929231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gino Hahnemann","original_name":"Gino Hahnemann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a193dbf0e0a264cc1027c1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":828,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7tJCWXNcpEmCkpos4vBr9N8EJms.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
