To the Beach explores this feeling from three vantage points, filmed (respectively) near, in, and under the sea using a variety of techniques, and registers the resulting images onto hand-made film emulsion. I. Approaching the Shore: in which the ocean first offers its irresistible salty scent. II. Swimming: in which we become again what we are. III. Seeing Stars: as above, so below.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gJ8RsuRPqAsMbyWKHkqTNrj1riI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To the Beach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Schaller","original_name":"Robert Schaller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1748e89251410336006279","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gJ8RsuRPqAsMbyWKHkqTNrj1riI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
