In this film, Louis Theroux embeds himself in two of London's biggest adult eating-disorder treatment facilities: St Ann's Hospital and Vincent Square Clinic. As he spends more time with patients both on and off the wards, he witnesses the dangerous power that anorexia holds over them, and finds himself drawn into a complex relationship between the disorder and the person it inhabits.","popularity":0.4327,"poster_path":"/10zYCIJIiAHiBI6ssVbwsXhZOOY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Louis Theroux: Talking to Anorexia","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":219396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Theroux","original_name":"Louis Theroux","popularity":0.32,"profile_path":"/lp5wgfBB5AMivBGdxnDl9yMI6PE.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a12672892514138f0064ea1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":219396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Theroux","original_name":"Louis Theroux","popularity":0.32,"profile_path":"/lp5wgfBB5AMivBGdxnDl9yMI6PE.jpg","credit_id":"5a126750c3a368628c059d10","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellena Wood","original_name":"Ellena Wood","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a12673dc3a3686283066bc3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1903635,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Kingsley","original_name":"Nick Kingsley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/q00HRFQIH4l30xrW4eNCW5shzEB.jpg","credit_id":"5c4df5c60e0a263ccdd60185","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Noyce","original_name":"Jonathan Noyce","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/iG9RrFZC1BzGSqTd4Ay644jtW01.jpg","credit_id":"5c4df5fc9251410e245d47ad","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1903634,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Danny Farrant","original_name":"Danny Farrant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4df5cfc3a368478991e17a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7608042","wikidata_id":"Q116970744","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jDI1kjrRQymScZhG1fAib67vkA5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9EHqtb2ObQg5dux4ALpri92OvSm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nIOxAOKjQkZKUmIpaq2evIB7Azs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d8kee9UxwstyCOpqrqrRx6COCqb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/10zYCIJIiAHiBI6ssVbwsXhZOOY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AelKwAWpSdEsBLpNnpgCdv9Lmqv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g2rcuhexz99O39rBmF3ViT7CK2O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Hz6V5VMl7ejJuXeChCVr33DzA9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC Two","release_date":"2017-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Louis Theroux: Talking to Anorexia - Trailer | BBC Two","key":"fz1qbmXe4kI","published_at":"2017-10-23T10:55:09.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"5a12682ac3a3686283066cf4"}]}}}
