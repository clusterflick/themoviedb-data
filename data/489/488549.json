In a sweet impressionist film, Samara returns to the city she fled as a teenager to immerse herself in memories that are still buried there, in various places and in dusty boxes containing diaries, photos and VHS tapes. 1999 is not a ghost story, although it is populated by ghosts. The snow-covered streets, corridors and locker rooms of the school are intact, as in a dream, but the absence left by the wave of teenage suicides still resonates with unanswered questions, trauma and regret. Samara meets inspiring people who carry with them great pain and who, 16 years later, can finally comfort each other by breaking a long silence. In the end, the film interweaves different voices and gives rise to a collective reflection on the internalization of mourning and the need to learn to affirm one's desire to survive.","popularity":0.3519,"poster_path":"/oDUO7Vn37jyv0diTYRuTFA8OqT3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80269,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parábola Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":97696,"logo_path":"/s7Kvup5z3ElMyDRe7UZDFHxKlbB.png","name":"Beauvoir Films","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1999","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samara Grace Chadwick","original_name":"Samara Grace Chadwick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a15bb9492514139fe001cb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samara Grace Chadwick","original_name":"Samara Grace Chadwick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a15bb9ec3a36830a9001dda","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9047754","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oDUO7Vn37jyv0diTYRuTFA8OqT3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6270,"name":"high school"},{"id":236,"name":"suicide"},{"id":171411,"name":"teen suicide"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
