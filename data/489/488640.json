Among the contributors are prison officers, detectives, relatives of victims, pen pals and inmates who served time with him. They reveal how Brady has shown a psychopathic lack of connection with his crimes. Arrested and charged in 1965, he’s never been considered for parole, nor has he asked to be freed.","popularity":0.1957,"poster_path":"/b2ZgAfuLPvAuS9igXdRc920iycY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24546,"logo_path":"/AffgIsVKcudKagSu3MV3phsV5Vw.png","name":"ITV Studios","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":4459,"logo_path":null,"name":"Channel V","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ian Brady: 50 Years Behind Bars","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Aird","original_name":"Holly Aird","popularity":0.6932,"profile_path":"/uB8kDEIoqfwMBfZzmA5aRcMKsTD.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a164932925141539d003fb5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Brady","original_name":"Ian Brady","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/msM7fof9sAMdiB77qUdIBS7Yw0z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a16493ec3a36870550041e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449783,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John McVicar","original_name":"John McVicar","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ex convict","credit_id":"5a1649b4c3a3687046003d09","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Rafferty","original_name":"Jean Rafferty","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Penpal","credit_id":"5a1649cdc3a368704f00422b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1927926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Topping","original_name":"Peter Topping","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Manchester CID","credit_id":"5a1649f692514153a3004019","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel 'Razor' Smith","original_name":"Noel 'Razor' Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ex convict","credit_id":"5a164a120e0a2612ec0042e3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Allsion","original_name":"Eric Allsion","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ex convict, penpal","credit_id":"5a164a30c3a3687057003ce8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1423204,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Christine Hart","original_name":"Christine Hart","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Journalist","credit_id":"5a164a68c3a368704a003e1a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5011238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Cold","original_name":"Jeremy Cold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Brady’s Psychiatrist","credit_id":"6715049a650248b9db627c81","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928291,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeremy Phillps","original_name":"Jeremy Phillps","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a164984925141539d003fee","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2583388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Hill","original_name":"Helen Hill","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8140f90bc5290012eff222","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5701308","wikidata_id":"Q26916840","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.571,"height":1144,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b2ZgAfuLPvAuS9igXdRc920iycY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":653}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9826,"name":"murder"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
