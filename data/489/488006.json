A white South African middle-class mother and daughter are brought together by the mother's illness. That closeness is more than metaphorical: the daughter must get into the bath to wash her weakened mother. Perhaps prompted by that, the two begin to exhume personal memory - discovering how they recall the past differently and how these nuances of shared experiences shape their perceptions of the present. This contested past is evoked by archival Super-8 footage that is as absorbing as the spinal narrative.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Remember Differently","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2388012","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
