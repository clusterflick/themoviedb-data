Daniel never leaves his armchair and spends his days reading comic books. One day Daniel’s Mom, after seeing a television programme How Clean is Your House, decides to clean the flat and give Danijel a bath. Finally in exhaustion, she falls asleep in her armchair, and Danijel runs away from home. He ends up at the train station but instead of boarding a train, he just stands on the platform and watches the trains go by. This is where his Mom will eventually find him and take him back home.","popularity":0.1263,"poster_path":"/rEnjUfPYD35eqRmYVFo3qcFMah8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64994,"logo_path":"/dLQeFa492g18EnsF0QN2LuToeYY.png","name":"Akademija dramske umjetnosti (ADU)","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daniel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikša Butijer","original_name":"Nikša Butijer","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/ciBqKsWNgF127NxZ32xH2p6yBjX.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a14349a9251413651008dc9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Biserka Ipša","original_name":"Biserka Ipša","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a1434a6c3a3684ef70091f2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1927487,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Eva Kraljević","original_name":"Eva Kraljević","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1434c59251413651008e01","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hana Jušić","original_name":"Hana Jušić","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1434b49251413661008ec6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rEnjUfPYD35eqRmYVFo3qcFMah8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":546}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
