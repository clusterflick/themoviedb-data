The collapse of the U.S. economy is the result of conscious choices made over thirty five years by a small group: leaders of corporations and their elected allies, and the biggest lobbying interest in Washington, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. To these individuals, the collapse is not a catastrophe, but rather the planned outcome of their long, patient work. For the rest of the country, it is merely the biggest heist in American history.","popularity":1.0289,"poster_path":"/4UC6U5was3R02VhRbTwYFtjRD5B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"WAKE  UP !","title":"Heist: Who Stole the American Dream?","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":501362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Warren","original_name":"Elizabeth Warren","popularity":0.5161,"profile_path":"/cyurT5D8YrO3D50kJKNBl6XBTV8.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d107847c3a36809b21eed01","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rupert Murdoch","original_name":"Rupert Murdoch","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/5Ysbvoasjtp1gioafrhGudg4lcF.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5d10787fc3a3682f68250210","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barack Obama","original_name":"Barack Obama","popularity":1.0798,"profile_path":"/reEkbvLlNknpCo2I37Vim6XpqGu.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5d107896c3a3681ab61e3adb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Gates","original_name":"Bill Gates","popularity":0.4518,"profile_path":"/pfcHWxPaK6xqqSVlH28kGEJmShs.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5d1078c60e0a264c73c9edd6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George W.
