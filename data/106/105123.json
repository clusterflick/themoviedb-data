It follows the short life of early Australian aviator, Cliff Carpenter, using his narrative as a template to speak for all lives senselessly lost in wartime conflict. The documentary climaxes in the skies over Oslo, Norway as two Messerschmitt Bf110's attack a RAF Sunderland Flying Boat. Nine airmen perish and one miraculously survives. The story is told through the eyes of Bill Young, the nephew Cliff would never know.","popularity":0.1556,"poster_path":"/m3m0puQcMZIRsAEkqh1LQp2pjaU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Very Short War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Young","original_name":"Bill Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f94f6f7f29d66509d0cd9eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829075,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Susan Young","original_name":"Susan Young","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f94f714d11e0e76e18e8e19","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537260,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Kaldor","original_name":"Peter Kaldor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f94f7a7076ce818c64cda1c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829048,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Myles Conti","original_name":"Myles Conti","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f94f6ceb3440956bdf5b92c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829048,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Myles Conti","original_name":"Myles Conti","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f94f7c3435abd3432753a43","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829048,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Myles Conti","original_name":"Myles Conti","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f94f7b7391b9c0050281432","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829069,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karl Conti","original_name":"Karl Conti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f94f7282ceb533d95d7b3ba","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829079,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Walker","original_name":"Richard Walker","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f94f7742fccee0031b28085","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829080,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Greg Crittenden","original_name":"Greg Crittenden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f94f7d5ca4f67005e960845","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829081,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Harding","original_name":"John Harding","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f94f80a8c0a480032d246fe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1591623","wikidata_id":"Q4660440","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cFYZ2P1DXaVQFNH6XbJjrRtBQxF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m3m0puQcMZIRsAEkqh1LQp2pjaU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
