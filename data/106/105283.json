Once they are to be executed, then again they are to perform executions. The film tells in spectacular episodes about the fact that in the past more than one century and a half we kept marching from war to war; occupation and liberation turned out to be indifferent, and why couldn’t the Jews execute the SS-guys? Our heroes hover about dilapidated barracks, then again on the bridges of the capital they guess whose satellites or eternal friends for all times we might be just now. In the cupboard, among the preserved fruit bottles, Stalin is still hiding. The authors of the film are cited before court, then in a showcase hospital they are waiting for the end to come. A Soviet soldier-maid closes the film with a Péter Nádas-quote.","popularity":0.2396,"poster_path":"/2JmnM2Hgz0FvM9JsrCJrN27j86Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13011,"logo_path":null,"name":"Budapest Film Kft.","origin_country":""},{"id":16717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neurópa Film Kft","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2003-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A múlthoz nem visszanyúlni kell, a múltat le kell nyúlni.","title":"Wake Up, Mate, Don't You Sleep","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoltán Mucsi","original_name":"Zoltán Mucsi","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":"/i2PES4obtTwMC95PN2396pehnvO.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Kapa","credit_id":"52fe4a4ac3a36847f81c5921","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Péter Scherer","original_name":"Péter Scherer","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":"/vnsSJ6hQy1pt3ftymOwHGBsmmUf.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Pepe","credit_id":"52fe4a4ac3a36847f81c5925","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ildikó Tóth","original_name":"Ildikó Tóth","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/xCB2qxR2keAGMG5qYMcHqJ027Tn.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Russian Girl","credit_id":"52fe4a4ac3a36847f81c5929","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miklós Jancsó","original_name":"Miklós Jancsó","popularity":0.2969,"profile_path":"/umvVOkuXcH80ctSFtijqY7uxOQ2.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Miklós Jancsó","credit_id":"52fe4a4ac3a36847f81c592d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146827,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gyula Hernádi","original_name":"Gyula Hernádi","popularity":0.1405,"profile_path":"/lUs2voP1o8SavJY3yKzPPQE78n5.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Gyula Hernádi","credit_id":"52fe4a4ac3a36847f81c5931","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judit Schell","original_name":"Judit Schell","popularity":0.1921,"profile_path":"/bJTAWapRaZ0ulU7xVsZEX1Szu80.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"German Officer","credit_id":"52fe4a4ac3a36847f81c5935","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"István Márton","original_name":"István Márton","popularity":0.1068,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Pista","credit_id":"52fe4a4ac3a36847f81c5939","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":183192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Balázs Galkó","original_name":"Balázs Galkó","popularity":0.1394,"profile_path":"/ya8RG92yLXdwWE8RT9AFID7kJDN.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Galkó","credit_id":"52fe4a4ac3a36847f81c593d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Béla Fesztbaum","original_name":"Béla Fesztbaum","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/ijcoKU10fss6ZlouLKl7N56AWda.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Béla","credit_id":"52fe4a4ac3a36847f81c5941","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1036334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emese Vasvári","original_name":"Emese Vasvári","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/x26A1qdzaZqdZreBDmL12pfG1uv.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Emese","credit_id":"52fe4a4ac3a36847f81c5945","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Székely B.
