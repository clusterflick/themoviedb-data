They took refuge in a cheap no-name hotel they had heard about at 9, Rue Git le Coeur and were soon joined by William Burroughs, Ian Somerville, Brion Gysin, and others from England and elsewhere in Europe, seeking out the “freedom” that the Latin Quarter of Paris might provide.","popularity":0.3816,"poster_path":"/2jzuPMI6sBMr7e35TLxmuntQ0zb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beat Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1505017,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-Jacques Lebel","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Lebel","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/ydSWCd0F7qa4I1y6xJuTizXkwAs.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65ccfab2663627016308761d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810553,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Harold Chapman","original_name":"Harold Chapman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65ccfad01365450163a1b1ab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliot Rudie","original_name":"Elliot Rudie","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65ccfae0894ed6014726de6f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Regina Weinreich","original_name":"Regina Weinreich","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65ccfb754a0b190163ce7bac","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2744265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Miles","original_name":"Barry Miles","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65ccfbfeefd3c2017c37f27b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Golding","original_name":"Peter Golding","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65ccfe23894ed6017c284d0e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Harris","original_name":"Oliver Harris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65ccfe3b4a0b190186cf60c3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"'Cyclops' Lester","original_name":"'Cyclops' Lester","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65ccfff22588230164a67c7a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Ginsberg","original_name":"Allen Ginsberg","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/w7qQvokS1lp7IRgefiJdALaaiIi.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"65cd05dc894ed60163277928","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6471,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William S.
