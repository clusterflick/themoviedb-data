Talk to the Hand is an hour of nimble, profanity-strewn stand-up from the vibrant Nina Conti and her touring companions: the scruffy monkey, a posh-sounding owl-poet with a taste for generic verse, a Scottish granny, and the vodka-loving Lydia, recently purchased from another ventriloquist and yet to find a voice she likes. Her alter-egos come face to face with apparitions, special guests and real live humans which means you can rely on consistent lashings of warmth, technical brilliance, and vibrant wit.","popularity":0.4103,"poster_path":"/nQy6EO72XaWDzRpk9K9RKpA4EmH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nina Conti: Talk to the Hand","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Conti","original_name":"Nina Conti","popularity":0.3444,"profile_path":"/eytK1qN2GW74k00DlRmiI7fclhN.jpg","cast_id":1000,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4a46c3a36847f81c4be7","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2945654","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/43NGCM2enDNozY1YLh8eWtyLpEf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nQy6EO72XaWDzRpk9K9RKpA4EmH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1054},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cw7oaIOT14Pq9sh2YbJQ8mafHf1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9704,"name":"ventriloquist"},{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"},{"id":165493,"name":"puppet show"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
