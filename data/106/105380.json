They formed Strapped, an organization determined to find a way to safely ride these monster waves, and developed tow-in surfing--a technique which allows these fearless wave riders to stand up to some of the biggest waves in the world. This documentary explains their technique, and shows them in action--set to the sounds of U2, Mint Royale, Endo, Soil, and Grand Theft Auto.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strapped: The Origins of Tow-In Surfing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
