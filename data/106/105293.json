Little do they know, this ferocious father possesses extraordinary martial arts skill, crucifix blades and a gold handgun with the cross on the handle. Soon, in this \"bad\" neighborhood, the priest begins cleaning up the local drug dealing scum-bags. Then he meets lunatic Don Stroud in the confessional, and Stroud claims to be the bloodsucking, skull stealing \"vampire\" serial killer ravaging the city. The priest encounters a young lass who has visions of Stroud committing his dastardly deeds, and when the vampire kidnaps her the priest speaks the words, \"Open the gates of Hell! For I am the right hand of God!!!,\" and sets off towards his deadliest encounter yet.","popularity":1.4769,"poster_path":"/AOLklInv8QWScfbrycr6TrDTVC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89104,"logo_path":null,"name":"York Pictures Inc","origin_country":""},{"id":8460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Double Helix Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In a world of evil, vengeance is his.","title":"The Divine Enforcer","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"The Deadly Avenger - The Divine Enforcer","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Deadly Avenger","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan-Michael Vincent","original_name":"Jan-Michael Vincent","popularity":0.7303,"profile_path":"/b7yhLzbj72RLVemoj7wv7o3C30N.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Father Thomas","credit_id":"5395e4e3c3a368641d0049f7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Estrada","original_name":"Erik Estrada","popularity":1.419,"profile_path":"/9R7acxdXkI8wt4ocIbPBNMNMxIY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Monsignor","credit_id":"5395e566c3a368641d004a00","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Brown","original_name":"Jim Brown","popularity":0.5142,"profile_path":"/wfp06VC5yr9mdzdZ5JcbzqD5YEG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"King","credit_id":"5395e571c3a36864340049d2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Landers","original_name":"Judy Landers","popularity":0.9706,"profile_path":"/cryxbcdfWWsdBH6JZ7Y8s7dYxYf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Merna","credit_id":"5395e57dc3a3684e3600115a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Stroud","original_name":"Don Stroud","popularity":0.7063,"profile_path":"/nuFfAKgx4I2S5DPI7QbklE9xy07.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Otis","credit_id":"5395e589c3a3684f4500283d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Z'Dar","original_name":"Robert Z'Dar","popularity":0.7703,"profile_path":"/8NM28DeYwECvI5i6fVpcRNh1Vt8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kain","credit_id":"5395e599c3a3684e3600115c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31561,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Scott Shaw","original_name":"Scott Shaw","popularity":0.4018,"profile_path":"/bYOzwteHWQsvVxwOa3OsjanTaVy.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ace","credit_id":"5395e5a6c3a3684e36001160","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":214139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael M.
