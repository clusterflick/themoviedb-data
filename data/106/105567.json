In addition, the documentary offers a rare glimpse into the process John goes through to create and compose his music. Featured in the film are musicians Neil Young, Brian Wilson, Booker T. Jones, steel guitarist Robert Randolph, Don Was and a 10-piece gospel choir who all contribute to the album, which is produced by award-winning producer T-Bone Burnett. Musician Stevie Nicks and John's long-time lyricist Bernie Taupin also appear.","popularity":0.6896,"poster_path":"/pHtJkK3G190wD4uTRVtOq1HClng.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Union","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elton John","original_name":"Elton John","popularity":0.9181,"profile_path":"/9G3k29OWPyZtScEDZEAsFJpqiM7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4a50c3a36847f81c6f35","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Russell","original_name":"Leon Russell","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/v1KgMLesGMVUWsZBujqHdA6aju3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4a50c3a36847f81c6f39","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T Bone Burnett","original_name":"T Bone Burnett","popularity":0.1937,"profile_path":"/yovhYSs46safnXFQAHFjI3zUua1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4a50c3a36847f81c6f3d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11649,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cameron Crowe","original_name":"Cameron Crowe","popularity":0.6411,"profile_path":"/iBCN51wrmnSUr2mkQBuN9E2AZK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a50c3a36847f81c6f43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morgan Neville","original_name":"Morgan Neville","popularity":0.2383,"profile_path":"/gi8kgpBsyEh7AFboSoL1AI5dOhE.jpg","credit_id":"5b2a75a5c3a36855f500798a","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1854364","wikidata_id":"Q3523166","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pHtJkK3G190wD4uTRVtOq1HClng.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Tribeca)","release_date":"2011-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
