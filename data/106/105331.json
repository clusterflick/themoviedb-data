He is received by the French authorities, officers, and gendarmes, and conducted to the station for his departure to Rennes. This little scene was enacted on a dark rainy night, which is clearly shown in the film. The effects are further heightened by vivid flashes of lightning which are certainly new in cinematography.","popularity":0.1948,"poster_path":"/mZvFqhqmASj6GakP4l2n75nTHNt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1899-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landing of Dreyfus at Quiberon","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Landing of Dreyfus from Devil's Island","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.1982,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a4ac3a36847f81c5ba9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225580","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mZvFqhqmASj6GakP4l2n75nTHNt.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1899-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
