First off, their stepparents are despicably evil. Secondly, they seemed to have killed them. Now this mixed up mess of half-sisters and step-brothers have to figure out how to dispose of the bodies, cover up the murders, collect their grandfather's inheritance and somehow stick together as a family -- all without getting caught. Not to mention Joe's incessant need to keep tabs on his promiscuous sister, an eye on the precocious little ones and a lustful watch on the girl next-door. Growing up has its complications. Murder's just one of them.","popularity":1.7501,"poster_path":"/aBKXU8OcxQGoCtyidkDdQ3zbAMw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Step-Films
