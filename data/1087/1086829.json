The line-up features original Mayhem vocalist Maniac, plus Hellhammer on drums, Necrobutcher on bass & Blasphemer on guitar. The show also features a guest appearance by now-current Mayhem vocalist Attila Csihar on the track ‘From the Dark Past’.  With a crystal clear sound & the noticeably stunning drum work of Hellhammer, the band themselves considered this worthy of being labelled an official release, as Mayhem storm through a strong set full of classics from old releases ‘Deathcrush’ & ‘De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas’, to the post-Euronymous compositions as featured on ‘Wolf’s Lair Abyss’. Expect nothing but dark & chaotic black metal carnage.","popularity":0.061,"poster_path":"/LZLM51nRCmjbweFo6m9bgDBnAa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A SAVAGE SET OF BLACK METAL CLASSICS FROM THE NORWEGIAN LEGENDS CAPTURED IN 1998.","title":"Mayhem: Mediolanum Capta Est","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1774379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jørn Stubberud","original_name":"Jørn Stubberud","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ec47ff813cb60084b2cf7b","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Attila Csihar","original_name":"Attila Csihar","popularity":0.0451,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ec4814699fb70084e17ab9","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Axel \"Hellhammer\" Blomberg","original_name":"Jan Axel \"Hellhammer\" Blomberg","popularity":0.097,"profile_path":"/ed0GGy6QTvLLh8KFBuRglF5ygAG.jpg","credit_id":"63ec4826699fb700cee15025","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2830005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sven Erik Kristiansen","original_name":"Sven Erik Kristiansen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ec4840813cb60084b2cf93","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blasphemer","original_name":"Blasphemer","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ec4875813cb600dc073431","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/LZLM51nRCmjbweFo6m9bgDBnAa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
