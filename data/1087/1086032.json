In September, 1989, this small First Nations community blockaded six new logging roads, calling for a moratorium on logging and insisting that the government address their concerns. Filmed on location during the period of the blockade, this film raises important questions about our attitudes toward the environment, the exploitation of our natural resources and the rights and treatment of Indigenous peoples.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blockade: Algonquins Defend the Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boyce Richardson","original_name":"Boyce Richardson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e9ad3aa2e60200b5eeb79d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225194","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
