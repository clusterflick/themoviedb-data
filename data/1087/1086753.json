Originally created as a race car and homologated for the street, it became the most successful touring car in history and a fast selling model.  In the 30 years since its introduction, there have been five generations of M3 and two variants. Paul and Todd from Everyday Driver (“50 Years of the 911”) set out to drive and compare all seven models to discover what makes the M3 special and which generation is best.  Shot on location in the mountains of northern Utah, “ICON” traces the history and driving dynamics of all the M3s. Ride along for this one-of-a-kind comparison of the original “Ultimate Driving Machine”.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Icon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1104839,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"D.
