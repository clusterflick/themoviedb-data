He lies in bed and only repeats one word: Lebanna. The elves are desperate and don't know what to do anymore. Christmas seems lost when Santa's assistant Annabel uses magic and summons the greatest detective on earth to the castle. The man who appears in front of her doesn't seem very smart but she claims to be the great-great grandson of the great Sherlock Holmes. Annabel entrusts him with the case and an assistant to her, her son Sam. Will the two be able to solve the Lebanna mystery despite Sherlock being allergic to Christmas? Maybe the solution lies in some Arctic Friends cartoons that Santa watched as a child?","popularity":0.4172,"poster_path":"/5mmDjSMZfWzlTZvOWHpUdKW3fMx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103150,"logo_path":"/wLiVwcFWPTjjy4RIkGRleWI63c.png","name":"Fenix Entertainment","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":184844,"logo_path":"/gsd7K46hkePQejS6hN6Lc5RqBH1.png","name":"Iervolino & Lady Bacardi Entertainment","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sherlock Santa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Baldwin","original_name":"William Baldwin","popularity":1.8014,"profile_path":"/mFCUAl6Rko6ocONhFDCpztcmKXd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tony","credit_id":"63ebb9f9699fb7009e3cdae6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Arnold","original_name":"Tom Arnold","popularity":1.1934,"profile_path":"/z2ajL1ozVCS4Ug04zOGCNH06OPP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Frank","credit_id":"63ebba02f9253200853355d2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1490863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elva Trill","original_name":"Elva Trill","popularity":0.2303,"profile_path":"/gdTcDujkkPIoKtDZrGcbQ2voFI3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Peggy","credit_id":"63ebba0a699fb70084e11dec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Bilotta","original_name":"Bruno Bilotta","popularity":0.5167,"profile_path":"/1dsqLi8bboTD0UcR1T67dh4MvsJ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Bruno","credit_id":"680af39b8bcea66a86aac36f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2778539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Paul Bullard","original_name":"Jay Paul Bullard","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Doctor Smalls","credit_id":"680af3ac276bf64e41abc5a6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1614855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesco Cinquemani","original_name":"Francesco Cinquemani","popularity":0.1882,"profile_path":"/uiOEyCGy3tEjdOsUWo8qY8I2Ogd.jpg","credit_id":"63ebb9e91f3e6000a1c50cb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276565,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Iervolino","original_name":"Andrea Iervolino","popularity":0.1013,"profile_path":"/fYcOinCNh1HMZIcGkO3TXGj3c1Q.jpg","credit_id":"63ebba6cf925320079c8ea7a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385132,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Monika Bacardi","original_name":"Monika Bacardi","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ebba7b8e8702008640ad66","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907099,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mario Bellina","original_name":"Mario Bellina","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ebba891b729400866cee7e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907098,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrea Fazzini","original_name":"Andrea Fazzini","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ebba941b729400866cee85","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2438464,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Riccardo Di Pasquale","original_name":"Riccardo Di Pasquale","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ebbaa1813cb600c66c163a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382244,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vittorio Giannelli","original_name":"Vittorio Giannelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680af358f3cf6d66d79d32e1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176737,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giovanni Canevari","original_name":"Giovanni Canevari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680af374f3cf6d66d79d32f8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19389860","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":840,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5mmDjSMZfWzlTZvOWHpUdKW3fMx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207317,"name":"christmas"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
