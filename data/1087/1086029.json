Producer/Folklorist Erin Kellen and Director Jim Carnes intertwine scenes of family gatherings, singing conventions, and farm life in the Sand Mountain region of northeast Alabama with family recollections and more than a dozen songs from the revered shape-note tradition. The video explores how Sacred Harp singing is about more than just music - it is a life-shaping force, reflected by tradition, deep spiritual belief, and the community that embraces it.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7qV4Q4kGYIxzg5LUUyXKBFllLdh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Sacred Harp Family Portrait","title":"Sweet Is the Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3918505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Carnes","original_name":"Jim Carnes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e9a7959512e100cd729ed0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7qV4Q4kGYIxzg5LUUyXKBFllLdh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sweet is the Day Trailer","key":"ctRXDAKkAO8","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-01-20T18:14:07.000Z","id":"63e9a70f12777800ab955a0c"}]}}}
