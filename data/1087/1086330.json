At seventy-six, Angus still shows an enviable capacity for life, turning his hand to things that the leisure of retirement now makes possible. One of these is the rebuilding of an old fishing boat, converting it to sail. This is a picture of a man who has reached his later years with no slackening of interest in life, who finds a good and constant companion in nature, and contentment in the quiet isolation of his cabin by the shore.","popularity":0.1168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3919361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angus Mowat","original_name":"Angus Mowat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63ea9138f9253200c3fed5ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386827,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Farley Mowat","original_name":"Farley Mowat","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"63ea91491b7294007c490ec4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Canning","original_name":"William Canning","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea91a11b729400cd953cec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058623,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael J.F.
