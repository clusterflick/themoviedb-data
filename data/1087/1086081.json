Collaboratively conceived by director Brian J. Johnson and Vancouver’s acclaimed Company 605, Future Futures is a collection of five short dance films that explore the digital destiny of humankind through a unique merging of camera and visual effects with a specific choreographic vision. Embracing the absurdity of centering dance inside a sci-fi narrative, the experimental series collapses time to portray human culture at an unprecedented moment: the emergence of a new, autonomous, and intelligent being—the digital reflection and culmination of ourselves. Through its otherworldly imagery, choreography, and driving electronic sound score, Future Futures evolves into a strange, highly visual exploration of what we are if we are no longer tied to our physical bodies, and how we will define humanity when faced with a fading IRL existence.","popularity":0.1849,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":155567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Company 605","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Future Futures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1746409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasmine Chen","original_name":"Jasmine Chen","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/jiWCCHdbzC4u0TqSEwSpVix8edf.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"63e9d4ce6c849200851bb844","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3918611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justine A.
