The trip started off under a cloud of controversy, with politicians arguing against a team going to Libya; a country ruled by “Public Enemy number one”, Colonel Gaddafi.  This story tells the interweaving of the football craze sweeping the country, Libyan Arms going to the IRA and Beef Deals, which ultimately ended up in scandal. We hear from the Irish Team that travelled and the Libyan players they played. All set against a backdrop of archive and music of the era.","popularity":0.0724,"poster_path":"/6OahuQ0Cx7b7MFHDz8CIVfnGiok.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116967,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gambit Pictures","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÉ","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2019-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beef Deals, Arms Deals and a Football Match That Officially Never Happened","title":"In League With Gaddafi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3921071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Brannigan","original_name":"Kevin Brannigan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ec2b28f925320085338ba9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3007557,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cara Holmes","original_name":"Cara Holmes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ec2b3c8e870200a9895ee1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3921072,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Lennon","original_name":"Gary Lennon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ec2b571b729400866d21ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3921084,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Cormac Downes","original_name":"Cormac Downes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ec2b768e870200823b0476","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2283923,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alex Sapienza","original_name":"Alex Sapienza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ec2b8c1b7294008e15eb4f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3693459,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jamie Goldrick","original_name":"Jamie Goldrick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ec2b9f1f3e600089deacb9","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12453122","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1005,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6OahuQ0Cx7b7MFHDz8CIVfnGiok.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":670}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"In League with Gaddafi trailer","key":"430599043","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-06-19T04:25:46.000Z","id":"63ec2c118e870200823b0555"}]}}}
