It combines live action with hand-drawn animated mattes to create an abstract, sometimes disturbing portrait of a woman. Images break apart randomly and come back together. Nothing is ever completely revealed. This is a highly manipulated, non-linear, non-narrative piece. It does not tell a story, but it does create a feeling.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/gcFUzmY56ezyvi9ZNkCIxCPsiR1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frequent Seas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2349234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brady Lewis","original_name":"Brady Lewis","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63eb9da9f9253200c7b143ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":851,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gcFUzmY56ezyvi9ZNkCIxCPsiR1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
