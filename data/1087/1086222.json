The island became prosperous and the culture of the island has been handed down from generation to generation.  Iwai Island, Kaminoseki City, Yamaguchi Prefecture.  The 500 inhabitants of this island in the Seto Inland Sea help each other to survive the harsh natural environment. Water is limited on this rocky island, which often experiences typhoons. The people, however, have flourished by using the sea's resources and cultivating the rocky mountains. You can see clearly in this island that human activities are part of nature’s cycles.  In 1982, a nuclear power plant construction project in Tanoura, on the opposite shore about 3.5km from Iwai Island, was proposed. The people here have been opposing to the project.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/vHAyeAEa9ouTEZjLQ9KNbWyXvgo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151650,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pole Pole Times","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2010-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Holy Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Houri no shima","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335386,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aya Hanabusa","original_name":"Aya Hanabusa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea61c263aad200a14d765a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3919151,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Takahiro Ohtsuki","original_name":"Takahiro Ohtsuki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea60ffa2e602007bb878fc","department":"Production","job":"Production Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3919149,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chinatsu Ohkubo","original_name":"Chinatsu Ohkubo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea60d1a2e60200b5ef36f0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3919150,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tetsuo Shinomiya","original_name":"Tetsuo Shinomiya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea60dd6c849200851c10f9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seiichi Motohashi","original_name":"Seiichi Motohashi","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea60ac9512e100a97e9b5c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307284,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kisara Nakaue","original_name":"Kisara Nakaue","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea60eb12777800ab95d74b","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3919148,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryô Nukui","original_name":"Ryô Nukui","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea60c5a2e602008535ec01","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1642227","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vHAyeAEa9ouTEZjLQ9KNbWyXvgo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"『祝の島（ほうりのしま）』予告編","key":"fn2qN9kp204","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-04-24T21:08:00.000Z","id":"63ea616b63aad2008588cb2e"}]}}}
