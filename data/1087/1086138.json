The most colourful and loudest festival in Cologne celebrates a big birthday. In February 1823, a few men from Cologne's upper class founded the so-called 'Festordnende Komitee' - the forerunner of today's 'Festkomitee Kölner Karneval'. This 'big bang' was a reaction to the old festival getting out of hand in orgies and violence. Carnival was in danger. A ban by the Prussian rulers was imminent. The new committee wanted to control the wild goings-on, establish rules and organise the celebrations.","popularity":0.3287,"poster_path":"/8kA4ehO4JPqFlbBSu1B3uR2BtUd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mer fiere et Levve","title":"Alaaf - 200 Jahre Kölner Karneval","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1643633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moritz Heidelbach","original_name":"Moritz Heidelbach","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/5ddMB7qOKuaZkVwExn2ACgTQP1o.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Heinrich von Wittgenstein","credit_id":"63ea1d1a63aad200e05e35a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piet Fuchs","original_name":"Piet Fuchs","popularity":0.2556,"profile_path":"/aEaNKaSJFzOBpqimINP3hWMBhZB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Matthias de Nöel","credit_id":"63ea1d28d388ae008062d7f5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1735821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Heineking","original_name":"Lutz Heineking","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea1d429512e10079416e7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323343,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dirk Kämper","original_name":"Dirk Kämper","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea1d50d388ae00b63acfe0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2604471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wilm Huygen","original_name":"Wilm Huygen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea1d5ea2e60200932afd73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8kA4ehO4JPqFlbBSu1B3uR2BtUd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3473,"name":"carnival"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
