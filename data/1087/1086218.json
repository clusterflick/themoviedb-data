In Island of Birds, we visit Green Island, a sea bird sanctuary where puffins frolic. In Caplin Harvest, little silvery fish called caplin spawn by washing ashore along the waves, making an easy catch for fishermen. In Outports on the Move, off-shore houses are pried loose from their foundation and floated to the Newfoundland mainland, where schools, hospitals, stores and services are available to the community.","popularity":1.5335,"poster_path":"/9ZAMTlwLKzBlrfEyepcNQIMi42D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Along Newfoundland's Shores","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Outports on the Move","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Island of Birds","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Capelin Harvest","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9ZAMTlwLKzBlrfEyepcNQIMi42D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":736}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1357,"name":"fish"},{"id":6178,"name":"newfoundland and labrador"},{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"},{"id":277462,"name":"bird"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1962-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
