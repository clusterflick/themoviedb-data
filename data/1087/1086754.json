Few attainable mid-engined cars have ever been made, so we included the 4C’s primary rivals, the Porsche Cayman and Lotus Elise, and left Los Angeles for our biggest roadtrip and most ambitious film.  “Mid-Engines & Mountains” is a celebration of affordable mid-engined cars, friendship, and the joys of driving. Paul and Todd encounter the mundane and amazing, stopping in small towns and risking full-throttle blasts to pass the time. In the end they find roads that exceed their expectations and great cars worth arguing about.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mid Engines & Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2959814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Schmucker","original_name":"Paul Schmucker","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63ebf3751b729400866d02aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1104839,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"D.
