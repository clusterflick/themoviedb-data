This one-off screening event celebrates the fans and their cameras, as much as the band itself—a collision/collusion of the ephemeral moment on stage and the moments captured on camera.","popularity":0.2338,"poster_path":"/nPfBj6W4q0tD9Vnd1wfTTuzYEvJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Fugazi from Washington, D.C.","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"We Are Fugazi from Washington, DC","type":"poster title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"We Are Fugazi from Washington DC","type":"alternative spelling"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"We Are Fugazi from Washington D.C.","type":"alternative spelling"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian MacKaye","original_name":"Ian MacKaye","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/hWGVc8Ng7o6IxGCv7dDH9gZugF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"675e617138bc7e0dc35f6623","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Lally","original_name":"Joe Lally","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/pCk09YD8qcOdmzX7beuGxjYYvoH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"675e617ede8f34e0b2587833","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Picciotto","original_name":"Guy Picciotto","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/ogAwClTvNC6IrWBneOyXYBUZFMe.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"675e61bede8f34e0b2587847","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":74330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Canty","original_name":"Brendan Canty","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"675e6230ddab16ace0c28f9c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Krulik","original_name":"Jeff Krulik","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/pM0pwxW6dXNmgmx9MLCikqtbFr0.jpg","credit_id":"63ea60689512e100a97e9b3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Pattisall","original_name":"Joseph Pattisall","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea60a19512e100a97e9b51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3919146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Gross","original_name":"Joe Gross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ea608ea2e602007bb878d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nPfBj6W4q0tD9Vnd1wfTTuzYEvJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"World Premiere at the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center","release_date":"2023-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
