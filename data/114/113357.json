Touré now sees himself as a farmer and family man, and is trying to improve agricultural and social conditions in the province of Timbuktu. The region has no roads and no electricity and Touré himself drove director Marc Huraux across the vast expanse of unforgiving desert land that surrounds Niafunké to make this film. The cameras accompany Touré as he goes about his daily farm business, and fulfilling his role and responsibilities as an important local figure.","popularity":0.1586,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76922,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Circuit Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":1848,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les","origin_country":""},{"id":55047,"logo_path":"/jK8QZUn7RmHVV9Za0qnzj9bMQtV.png","name":"Paris Première","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2002-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ali Farka Touré - Le miel n'est jamais bon dans une seule bouche","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali Farka Touré","original_name":"Ali Farka Touré","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lui Même","credit_id":"5739ffc0c3a3680fa70000e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Afel Bocoum","original_name":"Afel Bocoum","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5739ffd6925141556c000168","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oumar Touré","original_name":"Oumar Touré","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5739ffde925141557b000192","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hamma Sankaré","original_name":"Hamma Sankaré","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5739ffe592514155660001a8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Souleyman Kane","original_name":"Souleyman Kane","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5739ffecc3a36806b80001ad","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1475641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Huraux","original_name":"Marc Huraux","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5739ff29c3a3680fa70000c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1475641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Huraux","original_name":"Marc Huraux","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5739ff3d9251415571000199","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0324978","wikidata_id":"Q2836213","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
