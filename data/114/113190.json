In North America, Pride is complicated by commercialization and a sense that the festivals are turning away from their political roots toward tourism, party promotion and entertainment. Christie documents the ways larger, more mainstream Pride events have supported the global Pride movement and how human rights components are being added to more established events. In the New York sequence, leaders organize an alternative Pride parade, the Drag March, set up to protest the corporatization of New York Pride. A parade in SÃ£o Paulo, the world's largest Pride festival, itself includes a completely empty float, meant to symbolize all those lost to HIV and to anti-gay violence.","popularity":2.993,"poster_path":"/7rPGoFpYF7zQ3aa7zeDpaOI8Kwl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Gay: The Politics of Pride","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Coolen","original_name":"Ken Coolen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Big Gay Ken","credit_id":"52fe4b2ec3a36847f81f6a31","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2398823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilbert Baker","original_name":"Gilbert Baker","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d67e42579a1c300139d5e3e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052645,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bob Christie","original_name":"Bob Christie","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b2ec3a36847f81f6a15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":172918,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Morris Chapdelaine","original_name":"Morris Chapdelaine","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b2ec3a36847f81f6a27","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie David","original_name":"Charlie David","popularity":0.3321,"profile_path":"/eUgCfqeRiRjXlLNCMy51vjIS5gk.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b2ec3a36847f81f6a2d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052645,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bob Christie","original_name":"Bob Christie","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b2ec3a36847f81f6a1b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1052379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aerlyn Weissman","original_name":"Aerlyn Weissman","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf2214d925141392eba2321","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1469864","wikidata_id":"Q4899974","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5vyjZdQsFhZNR25WweatDPryPoH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1206,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7rPGoFpYF7zQ3aa7zeDpaOI8Kwl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":843},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kqqUip6iZd07ASxmu0aJLITruoV.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1013,"name":"homophobia"},{"id":4098,"name":"civil rights"},{"id":4108,"name":"protest"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":33648,"name":"celebration"},{"id":156501,"name":"pride"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":160223,"name":"vancouver"},{"id":173662,"name":"gay pride"},{"id":183440,"name":"pride parade"},{"id":199882,"name":"identity politics"},{"id":206515,"name":"usa politics"},{"id":215522,"name":"british columbia"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"},{"id":264411,"name":"gay rights"},{"id":265759,"name":"canadian politics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Beyond Gay: The Politics of Pride - Trailer","key":"msB75Z5R-u4","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-01-13T16:09:43.000Z","id":"5fa18ec9e0ca7f003ad115ee"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Beyond Gay: The Politics of Pride - Trailer","key":"6hqR1-QtebE","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-09-20T02:02:03.000Z","id":"607b78d643d9b1003fdefec5"}]}}}
