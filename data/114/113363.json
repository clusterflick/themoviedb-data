Her challenge is to walk the 60 kilometres of Iceland's most famous hiking route, a trail that just happens to end at the unpronounceable volcano that brought air traffic across Europe to a standstill in 2010 . With the help of Icelandic mountain guide Hanna, Julia faces daunting mountain climbs, red hot lava fields, freezing river crossings, deadly clouds of sulphuric gas, swirling ash deserts and sinister Nordic ghost stories as she attempts to reach the huge volcanic crater at the centre of the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull glacier.","popularity":0.3759,"poster_path":"/21ngGZA4oVmeZ11ZtRXNApuLKeK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100425,"logo_path":"/1DVGShTeRir1NLjgLevCXBKGTQa.png","name":"Skyworks","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Julia Bradbury's Iceland Walk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Julia Bradbury's Icelandic Walk","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1695290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Bradbury","original_name":"Julia Bradbury","popularity":0.0883,"profile_path":"/4iastyuILLNaRPXGHpeofIIlLI4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"615d9d188e2ba600619a04c1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":217926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Watts","original_name":"Nick Watts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615d9c1ceb14fa0062893526","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3260578,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Damian Eggs","original_name":"Damian Eggs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615d9d6dc8a2d40043c63840","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644267,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Marshall","original_name":"James Marshall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615d9e1b8e2ba6008beb97ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644282,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Clare Jones","original_name":"Clare Jones","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615d9ea369eb900061dc475f","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99892,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Clare Paterson","original_name":"Clare Paterson","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615d9f06b1f68d0027586c64","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3260586,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Damian Keogh","original_name":"Damian Keogh","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615d9f6bd14443002c0e606f","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3260561,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Harwood","original_name":"Eric Harwood","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615d9f938e2ba600434ab9d9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":217926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Watts","original_name":"Nick Watts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615d9faa6beaea00638eb1c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2022436","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3vlrNHlZi3de9w0skibQLfew04.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ev4Vkfmx3iXqrlxBx2qeVHiCreL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/21ngGZA4oVmeZ11ZtRXNApuLKeK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5827,"name":"hiking"},{"id":3347,"name":"volcano"},{"id":5746,"name":"iceland"},{"id":7330,"name":"glacier"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC Four","release_date":"2011-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
