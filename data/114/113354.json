Using images from Artis (Amsterdam Zoo), Bert Haanstra shows that a couple of similarities can be discovered between human and animal. Particularly the manner in which human and ape are confronted with each other, is significant. The images speak for themselves, human voices or commentary is absent. The ironic music of Pim Jacobs does add an extra dimension to the whole. With regards to human and animal Haanstra limits himself for the time being to this short film, recorded with a hidden camera. Later on, in several big films, he would return to this subject.","popularity":0.3779,"poster_path":"/mbuE6RNMkAQoLM3UKYQf1SKhQZU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Zoo","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Зоопарк","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Haanstra","original_name":"Bert Haanstra","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/eZ5IJ3iq95lntxhshy5dAmW4zn3.jpg","credit_id":"537b1876c3a3685e14001372","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2146920,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wim Huender","original_name":"Wim Huender","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d2606812425c017ce31e8d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51781,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fred Tammes","original_name":"Fred Tammes","popularity":0.151,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d2601ca313b801646f7701","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2032145,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pim Jacobs","original_name":"Pim Jacobs","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d260324d67910186d3089c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Haanstra","original_name":"Bert Haanstra","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/eZ5IJ3iq95lntxhshy5dAmW4zn3.jpg","credit_id":"6718cfc6b3d5cbb842f3b468","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Haanstra","original_name":"Bert Haanstra","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/eZ5IJ3iq95lntxhshy5dAmW4zn3.jpg","credit_id":"6718cfcfb3d5cbb842f3b475","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kees Hin","original_name":"Kees Hin","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6718cfe5769107d77b47541e","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0056722","wikidata_id":"Q19588486","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pIyhLtddlVYyEJHjvZDrMvhsdMp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/mbuE6RNMkAQoLM3UKYQf1SKhQZU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2172,"name":"zoo"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":269412,"name":"poetic documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
