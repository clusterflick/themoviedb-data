The staging reproduces the Milgram experiment carried out initially in the United States in 1960 to study the influence of authority on obedience: electric shocks are fictitious, an actor pretending to suffer, and objective is to test the ability to disobey the candidate who inflicts this treatment and who is not aware of the experiment. The notable difference with the original experience is that scientific authority is replaced by a television presenter, Tania Young.","popularity":0.3146,"poster_path":"/kJbTaBNaYmOtg5qV23S3RoTjRrh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98177,"logo_path":"/6JFTX9NKUsBmUulNssubQVYI2NX.png","name":"Yami 2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Jeu de la mort","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Game of Death","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2283322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tania Young","original_name":"Tania Young","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":"/qiLG2WAQT4wKidMcDCT5EfRQTIV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"L'animatrice","credit_id":"625b61269661fc00506513c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3593864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurent Ledoyen","original_name":"Laurent Ledoyen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2n0JX0FubYieDrfyRkuNCXdl27N.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jean-Paul","credit_id":"62aeebce90ea4b00543f4a86","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Torreton","original_name":"Philippe Torreton","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/8iPqW6sf8qBU9n5VPHjFb5FSVkU.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Voix off","credit_id":"62aeebe690ea4b00649707a8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1056793,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christophe Nick","original_name":"Christophe Nick","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b31c3a36847f81f73ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20431,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alain-Michel Blanc","original_name":"Alain-Michel Blanc","popularity":0.1596,"profile_path":"/vfc1ByngViDAiwcBSSXTJuS1KgY.jpg","credit_id":"62aeee20a6a4c100f0ab26d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Bornot","original_name":"Thomas Bornot","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62aeee46595a560061a4cf0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Amado","original_name":"Gilles Amado","popularity":0.1805,"profile_path":"/sXq9ANKcj2yKxKi16KwzpS9v96L.jpg","credit_id":"62aeee321bf26605b58e7042","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1056793,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christophe Nick","original_name":"Christophe Nick","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62af0ba32b93200061345e7e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1719498","wikidata_id":"Q1871821","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/axCXjMDF502lakr2sG6FTGzOq36.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/kJbTaBNaYmOtg5qV23S3RoTjRrh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/h4X3fhjQqG2HQNtKnucIrEYQQOA.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":714},{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3VhGUnqr6VtKHyTtj49Ae2jxjwn.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":527}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"RTS 2","release_date":"2010-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 2","release_date":"2010-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
