All the way along its 2,716 miles, we pass places that testify to the country’s tumultuous history, and encounter the ghosts of those who shaped its destiny: Stanley, the explorer, Leopold II, the colonizer, Mobutu, the despot. We also cross paths with an entire people – boatmen guiding their dugout canoes, fishermen, traveling salesmen, military personnel and rebels, women and children – searching for light and dignity.","popularity":0.1773,"poster_path":"/pXXh0UFxKT8V5vnVabu9tyBM4iK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Lingala","iso_639_1":"ln","name":""},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Congo River","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Michel","original_name":"Thierry Michel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b33c3a36847f81f7a63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Michel","original_name":"Thierry Michel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d34a00e0a2630b8052009","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440713,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Cheysson","original_name":"Thomas Cheysson","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d34ad0e0a2630b8052016","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1785702,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lokua Kanza","original_name":"Lokua Kanza","popularity":0.2505,"profile_path":"/7IiPjL7wszYh36pN5aoeYhrEG3n.jpg","credit_id":"5a9d34cfc3a3680b96043358","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991059,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michel Téchy","original_name":"Michel Téchy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d39260e0a260649046383","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1161035,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marie-Hélène Quinton","original_name":"Marie-Hélène Quinton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d3931c3a3680bb903e7ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0765438","wikidata_id":"Q2992991","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pXXh0UFxKT8V5vnVabu9tyBM4iK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
