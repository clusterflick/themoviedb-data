It explores life and death, the sense of place and personal displacement, and the intricate aesthetics of representation. It is a personal and spiritual film, marked inevitably by Chambers’s knowledge that he had leukemia. The late American avant-garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage said of Hart, \"If I named the five greatest films [ever made], this has got to be one of them.\"  Even this high praise falls short of hyperbole. The Hart of London is at the centre of Chambers’s extraordinary achievement.","popularity":0.4609,"poster_path":"/5V7miC4auYdrlc0aDaBl48lPRGT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1970-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hart of London","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Chambers","original_name":"Jack Chambers","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/ajRRKv7AOxJkvDSUKqe2yPvcnFW.jpg","credit_id":"533568e19251414454004222","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Chambers","original_name":"Jack Chambers","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/ajRRKv7AOxJkvDSUKqe2yPvcnFW.jpg","credit_id":"58e0b35bc3a3683d2a016993","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Chambers","original_name":"Jack Chambers","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/ajRRKv7AOxJkvDSUKqe2yPvcnFW.jpg","credit_id":"58e0b32f9251415e3c018215","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Chambers","original_name":"Jack Chambers","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/ajRRKv7AOxJkvDSUKqe2yPvcnFW.jpg","credit_id":"58e0b34ac3a3683d35017b54","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Chambers","original_name":"Jack Chambers","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/ajRRKv7AOxJkvDSUKqe2yPvcnFW.jpg","credit_id":"58e0b33c9251415e5f01849d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0129134","wikidata_id":"Q7738947","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/izSfL4d4fWK5wVQuiDOIkTqi5yo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vRByYCJCOKwcMIedswb4APfH1ha.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w6qhinFtvJmT9ySe5XmW6YLwKGN.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Al9E6DckPp7Ijjj9heogMJdWZvG.jpg","vote_average":6.312,"vote_count":8,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":930,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5V7miC4auYdrlc0aDaBl48lPRGT.jpg","vote_average":1.434,"vote_count":5,"width":620},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1016,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wkqxoXCHZ2XsDzq7LTeybl7pGr4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":686},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qqVeVtPX5XUhOq9XkPHmGcwJw9d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":997}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2300,"name":"despair"},{"id":7946,"name":"deer"},{"id":14882,"name":"ontario, canada"},{"id":17985,"name":"birth"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"},{"id":220141,"name":"city symphony"},{"id":226646,"name":"animal slaughter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
