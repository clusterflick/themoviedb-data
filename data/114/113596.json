Freshly graduated, they are relocated to a remote Thuringian village after causing a computer breakdown. There, they are supposed to work in a small company that has no clue of economic management. The rather helpful computer system from West Germany plainly lacks compatible software. But Frank and Kamminke are not allowed to work with the hardware, although it is them who could make most out of the complex system. Eventually, and with the help of consultant Petra whom both are in love with, they break into the system control room on New Year′s Eve and start up the computer with their special program.","popularity":1.1684,"poster_path":"/85LlVvaviABHl1fWrprVhsdcMSb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":87970,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gruppe \"Johannisthal\"","origin_country":"XG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1989-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Strange Characters","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Götz Schubert","original_name":"Götz Schubert","popularity":0.471,"profile_path":"/rHeZ6L1XkBDHSdQS4Ilj8N0KQjg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Frank Lettau","credit_id":"52fe4b39c3a36847f81f8c8f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Wien","original_name":"Matthias Wien","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Peter „Kamminke“ Galetzki","credit_id":"52fe4b39c3a36847f81f8c93","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone Thomalla","original_name":"Simone Thomalla","popularity":0.411,"profile_path":"/qIEz5cDiHoMuoFUjfoi5xcW5KRg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Petra Anschütz","credit_id":"52fe4b39c3a36847f81f8c97","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerit Kling","original_name":"Gerit Kling","popularity":0.4383,"profile_path":"/kq7KrMAQ8Mehd0UuaAE3pZ82kB7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gina","credit_id":"52fe4b39c3a36847f81f8c9b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaecki Schwarz","original_name":"Jaecki Schwarz","popularity":0.4399,"profile_path":"/p06smDqMhJ7ykgGa3yeyI8q2PT7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Walter Kremmel","credit_id":"52fe4b39c3a36847f81f8c9f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Sodann","original_name":"Peter Sodann","popularity":0.3795,"profile_path":"/p9TYMUxyvvgnsS9OeOzVagns16M.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Werner Heilmann","credit_id":"52fe4b39c3a36847f81f8ca3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dieter Mann","original_name":"Dieter Mann","popularity":0.2141,"profile_path":"/cvVNmGTgbq9xhMHCYH1XHwxkULt.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dr. Bauer","credit_id":"52fe4b39c3a36847f81f8ca7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walfriede Schmitt","original_name":"Walfriede Schmitt","popularity":0.4591,"profile_path":"/j5kHYVJrUYVTxKLeKcpolb0BktO.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Vogelsang","credit_id":"52fe4b39c3a36847f81f8cab","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Delmare","original_name":"Fred Delmare","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":"/xQtIdXUM5J8qtkXlPxfiHbwXeFY.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Hausmeister","credit_id":"52fe4b39c3a36847f81f8caf","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Schmude","original_name":"Doris Schmude","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Silikon-Wally","credit_id":"52fe4b39c3a36847f81f8cb3","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gisbert-Peter Terhorst","original_name":"Gisbert-Peter Terhorst","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Menzel","credit_id":"52fe4b39c3a36847f81f8cb7","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Merkel","original_name":"Harry Merkel","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"1.
