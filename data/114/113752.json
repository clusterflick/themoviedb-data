USS Seaviper must locate and stop this dangerous exchange. The Captain of USS Seaviper must go ashore to conduct reconnaissance on an island near Sumatra, but the ship is left in the hands of Mister Cutter, after the Executive Officer is injured in battle. A conflict between Cutter and the Chief of the Boat puts the submarine in jeopardy. Seaviper is trapped below the surface, with decreasing oxygen, and a Japanese destroyer hunting them from above. Damage to the boat also leave her survival in question. They must fight the Japanese destroyer and get the information about U-235 back to Pearl Harbor.","popularity":0.5685,"poster_path":"/eOyZge0vfP9WWIy1UzaEF7nPI8u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23888,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mighty Moments Motion Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":23886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Villani Rockhill Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Heroism runs deep.","title":"USS Seaviper","video":false,"vote_average":3.3,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Sea Viper","type":"IMDB Display"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Iroes sta vathi ton okeanon","type":"DVD Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1057684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Large","original_name":"Tim Large","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Chief Keenan","credit_id":"52fe4b3dc3a36847f81f996b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1057685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy King","original_name":"Jeremy King","popularity":0.1209,"profile_path":"/zAcqYXgQUcTtSdGzVbvhz9yYthG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Officer Cutter","credit_id":"52fe4b3dc3a36847f81f996f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1057686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robb Maus","original_name":"Robb Maus","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Exec.
