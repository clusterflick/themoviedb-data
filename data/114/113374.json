This feature documentary will combine excerpts from the extensive interviews with extraordinary contemporary archive. The result will be a unique insight into the mind and personality of the man who, more than any other single individual, shaped the foreign policy of the United States - not only during his time in office, but afterwards, when he continued to act as consigliere to successive presidents as well as to governments around the world.","popularity":0.2763,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":136575,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chimerica Media","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kissinger","video":false,"vote_average":5.667,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":533195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Kissinger","original_name":"Henry Kissinger","popularity":0.5265,"profile_path":"/91UzhTU4tZUFNloNdn0lakKFdbH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"643b33ca719aeb04f5ebaa1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niall Ferguson","original_name":"Niall Ferguson","popularity":0.1051,"profile_path":"/ucx31NPgLyonp2zIxgQ68PRnyYA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"661266231108a8017d8e4439","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359307,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adrian Pennink","original_name":"Adrian Pennink","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661265e41108a8017d8e43c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1772315,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Melanie Fall","original_name":"Melanie Fall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661266566f43ec017dc290a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358770,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joby Gee","original_name":"Joby Gee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6612667e1f3319017dc2edb7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4640842,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Celia Dougherty","original_name":"Celia Dougherty","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66137d04a6a4c10186bcf715","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489725,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vivienne Steele","original_name":"Vivienne Steele","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66137cd0048638017c1a4282","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102455,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ben Bartlett","original_name":"Ben Bartlett","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66137b7359008600e37c6c23","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63599,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dewald Aukema","original_name":"Dewald Aukema","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66137b636c84920185fc9eea","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469338,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mike Curd","original_name":"Mike Curd","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66137c9c6c84920162fc5b71","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4640840,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charlotte Wilkins","original_name":"Charlotte Wilkins","popularity":0.0372,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66137ceb982f74017e5fc307","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1845586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olatz Gonzalez","original_name":"Olatz Gonzalez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66137c1a8ee0a9017ea3b0af","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4640843,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Rockett","original_name":"Jason Rockett","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66137d213d74540185074fff","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369067,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Danny Carr","original_name":"Danny Carr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66137beb982f74014b5fa789","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1950222","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
