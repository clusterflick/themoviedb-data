A fable about an old man with an odd effect on those he encounters, the film is a funny, warm-hearted postcard from an important moment in American cinema. GOLDSTEIN, starring veteran character actor Lou Gilbert, shared the Prix de la Nouvelle Critique at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival with Bertolucciâ€™s Before the Revolution. Cinema deity Jean Renoir called the film \"the best American film I have seen in 20 years.\"","popularity":0.5197,"poster_path":"/aVUQ3pclwEQH4GICYGVRhzcdC8z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11114,"logo_path":null,"name":"Braun Entertainment
