They are called Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg. The two of them dreamed of this plane, the flying symbol of human knowledge at the service of renewable energy. On July 7, 2010, the plane leaves the hangar at last to deploy its wings in the sun and attempt a challenge that nobody thought possible in aviation: flying day and night for 26 hours without stopping, using only solar power.","popularity":0.0712,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wings of the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Las alas del sol","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri de Gerlache","original_name":"Henri de Gerlache","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b26c3a36847f81f5367","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2101436","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Les Ailes Du Soleil (The Wings of the Sun)","key":"WlajhrGGKD8","published_at":"2011-10-29T09:41:13.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e4c3a3685448008971"}]}}}
