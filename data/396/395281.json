In this studio in Utrecht, composers and artists worked on their own compositions. In 1961, Jan Vrijman made a film about Karel Appel, De werkelijkheid van Karel Appel, and Appel himself made a musical composition for this film in the studio in Utrecht. Van der Elsken films and photographs Appel during the composition of his Musique Barbare, as well as recording conversations on tape; the film is in fact a kind of collage of film, photographs and sound. As well as an exceptional record of Karel Appelâ€™s working process, this film is a unique documentation of the studio and therefore a significant piece of Dutch musical history.","popularity":0.1443,"poster_path":"/5jlIy5vCjy1IgPMjymNtlENuR1P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karel Appel, Composer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1127377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karel Appel","original_name":"Karel Appel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"572358ffc3a368646c001812","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frits Weiland","original_name":"Frits Weiland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"572359369251413eaf002856","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed van der Elsken","original_name":"Ed van der Elsken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tsoU0BPhI421rh5fVTXkOIN96py.jpg","credit_id":"5723595dc3a368646c001828","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed van der Elsken","original_name":"Ed van der Elsken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tsoU0BPhI421rh5fVTXkOIN96py.jpg","credit_id":"57235966c3a368759c0023bf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5jlIy5vCjy1IgPMjymNtlENuR1P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":208111,"name":"electroacoustics"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
