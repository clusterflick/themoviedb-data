Within a few days, his life changes completely: his best friend, after a wild motorcycle ride to escape the police after an attempted grand theft, dies. Alessandro learns the tragic news directly from the boss of his clan who, at the same time, puts him under loyalty test: Alessandro must kill the boss of the rival clan in order to gain final control of the territory. Alessandro is puzzled. In this situation, can a casual meeting with a priest of the same 'neighborhood' spare the life of this young man from a life of criminality and despair?","popularity":0.1962,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2006-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luce nell'ombra","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanni Rienzo","original_name":"Giovanni Rienzo","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":"/y5T4kUjNWvvEGPxhSvUMoW74KM0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Prete","credit_id":"5725bee992514132b80018ae","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":132847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincenzo Merolla","original_name":"Vincenzo Merolla","popularity":2.363,"profile_path":"/nWKx7sVLxglCrlYKTBVCckaLjPU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Boss","credit_id":"5725c011c3a368305a00384f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1613602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabio Massa","original_name":"Fabio Massa","popularity":0.2932,"profile_path":"/cfrdMxxvcIFejXLm1GNanJC9nTT.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Alessandro","credit_id":"5725bed5c3a368172000289e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruggiero Coppola","original_name":"Ruggiero Coppola","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Guy 1","credit_id":"5725bef99251417782001eb4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianluca Cuomo","original_name":"Gianluca Cuomo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Guy 2","credit_id":"582a5e569251417b1a03ecc4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613608,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Antonello de Simone","original_name":"Antonello de Simone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5725c0989251413309001b2d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1605597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liam Connor","original_name":"Liam Connor","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/5EeEcLBBbVTaxlJOw612kbHhBs0.jpg","credit_id":"5725c085c3a368180a002d8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1613607,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Riccardo Papa","original_name":"Riccardo Papa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5725c071c3a36817200028da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1613602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabio Massa","original_name":"Fabio Massa","popularity":0.2932,"profile_path":"/cfrdMxxvcIFejXLm1GNanJC9nTT.jpg","credit_id":"5725c04dc3a368305a00385b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1605597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liam Connor","original_name":"Liam Connor","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/5EeEcLBBbVTaxlJOw612kbHhBs0.jpg","credit_id":"5725c0a99251411e9f002713","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3764938","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
