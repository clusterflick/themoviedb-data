Meanwhile, Cecil has fallen in love with the pretty Colette … without suspecting that her father, the wealthy Bartell, was a former lover of his mother and that he’s Cecil’s daddy.  Thus, both Carmen and Bartell try to prevent the unfolding love-relationship between brother and sister, because this ain’t the Ozarks, you know!  Only after the unhappy Cecil tries to commit suicide after an argument with his mother do Carmen and Bartell realize they still love one another.  Suicide attempt be damned; let’s go out on a date!  A movie that screams “Fun for the whole family.”","popularity":0.1587,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terra-Filmkunst","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1938-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die fromme Lüge","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pola Negri","original_name":"Pola Negri","popularity":0.1139,"profile_path":"/2KI4sZ31LcUR9dBN2ij9GTr8pMd.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Carmen Casini","credit_id":"572883a09251415f75000124","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1573822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Braun","original_name":"Hermann Braun","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Cecil Lasko","credit_id":"572883ca9251410387004d18","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Hübner","original_name":"Herbert Hübner","popularity":0.2858,"profile_path":"/hUHd2MXZM7t7gxEh7p6zBMDLAuh.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Bartell","credit_id":"572883e7c3a36821480038bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harald Paulsen","original_name":"Harald Paulsen","popularity":0.1937,"profile_path":"/m7JkKrut1Z1VnZTcuuJQcf6a1rI.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Smith","credit_id":"572883f9c3a3682dee003152","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josefine Dora","original_name":"Josefine Dora","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":"/lnNXRUmoH8oKI6zTDWdIzAXYmwm.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Theres","credit_id":"5728840f9251415f75000136","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1614668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suse Graf","original_name":"Suse Graf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Colette","credit_id":"57288426c3a36821480038ca","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Leibelt","original_name":"Hans Leibelt","popularity":0.1956,"profile_path":"/45HHcA9PhBXREKxXVcMc1IJCx7n.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Sam Milbrey","credit_id":"5728843ec3a3682dee00315c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jupp Hussels","original_name":"Jupp Hussels","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/q7lzU6P9l6BRSosj9QRLu2G9R1q.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Rennbahnreporter","credit_id":"57e6a9f8c3a368475d000484","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Gross","original_name":"Walter Gross","popularity":0.1424,"profile_path":"/4mtIPs5ZFxmeIDvjEEhM29pQcSB.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Rundfunkreporter","credit_id":"5abd6ca79251410a530000f0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":591908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotte Spira","original_name":"Lotte Spira","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/neiKgltw6L2vJsywhv59CkTjUdO.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"","credit_id":"5abd6cb3c3a3685c4d0002a5","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Peukert","original_name":"Leo Peukert","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/dLBwA8lKrFzKCSq1n2UiwV9hJTN.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Opernhausdirektor","credit_id":"5abd6cc20e0a267388000172","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liselotte Schaak","original_name":"Liselotte Schaak","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/mm8LSIWrdevc6jhCOWoDMWtUu4h.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Krankenschwester","credit_id":"5c77127bc3a36842d5900149","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1042171,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nunzio Malasomma","original_name":"Nunzio Malasomma","popularity":0.1303,"profile_path":"/oXkrYI7CLWeiaFPHhVI6D1QEx8Y.jpg","credit_id":"572882ad92514124a30019ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28052,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philipp Lothar Mayring","original_name":"Philipp Lothar Mayring","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"572882bf92514124a30019d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":18503,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harald G.
