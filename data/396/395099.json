His neighbour Kankamma, who rejects an evil landlord’s advances, is evicted from her house; the trade unionist is killed in police custody; and Ravi starts exhibiting his work on the streets to indicate his growing politicisation to the satisfaction of his Marxist friend. The film is geared to the CPI(ML)-led political movements in Northern AP and included the compositions and songs of the region’s best-known radical poet and performer, Gaddar.","popularity":0.0812,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Telugu","iso_639_1":"te","name":"తెలుగు"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colourful Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1299708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"B.
