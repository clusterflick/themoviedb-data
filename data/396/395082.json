Initially acclaimed, then forgotten, and now rediscovered, the adventure of this hundred-year-old theory has marked the scientific history of the 20th century. From its inception, a mathematical difficulty arose that could have nipped the theory in the bud: the Schwarzschild singularity. In the company of great international relativistic physicists, the viewer embarks on a discovery of this theory with a singular destiny. We discover a \"curved\" universe that proves to be even stranger than Einstein had envisioned, and harbours some objects - such as black holes - that still challenge today's scientists.","popularity":0.843,"poster_path":"/2VP4M7bmxuk0lkACuKGDJGjfOAi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Institut Lagrange de Paris","origin_country":""},{"id":76117,"logo_path":"/6GBfBiE0nz6kgkNdTku3ls8ZYii.png","name":"Look at Sciences","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":76118,"logo_path":null,"name":"Institut Henri Poincaré","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Einstein et la Relativité Générale, une histoire singulière","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Astier","original_name":"Alexandre Astier","popularity":0.5923,"profile_path":"/itQkV39IyDouF7lWy9xmwJdgy3f.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Albert Einstein (voix off)","credit_id":"57224bcb9251413ea6000046","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Philippe Uzan","original_name":"Jean-Philippe Uzan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"572249adc3a36879f2003d4c","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Eisenstaedt","original_name":"Jean Eisenstaedt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5722499692514121c6001563","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quentin Lazzarotto","original_name":"Quentin Lazzarotto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/AaIiKszZvJZfvysdcPWrh4Evvg8.jpg","credit_id":"572249789251414494003cc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1957395,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vincent Gaullier","original_name":"Vincent Gaullier","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efb0aeac5840d00360f5892","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5185892","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.761,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2VP4M7bmxuk0lkACuKGDJGjfOAi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":761}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8689,"name":"albert einstein"},{"id":214349,"name":"relativity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
