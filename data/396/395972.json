In Auckland’s Grey Lynn, they hoped they had found it — the Monterey. The addition of a proudly Samoan kitchen crew formed the soul of a community-minded establishment. They feel they have the kitchen under control, so when a young and ambitious chef from the UK is introduced into the mix, with new rules and demands, tensions boil over. Everyone is forced to re-examine their roles and loyalties. Mira and Paul are confronted by the fragility of their work, family and the repercussions of their decisions on all of them. Is it possible to salvage their dream? Can what has been done ever be undone?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monterey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
