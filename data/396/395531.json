In this utterly charming showbiz chronicle, four stellar magicians will amaze even the staunchest of skeptics. But for each of these virtuosos, true success seems illusory. Among them: Brian Gillis was Johnny Carson’s favourite close-up magician and a regular on The Tonight Show; David Minkin can levitate almost anything with his mind; and Jon Armstrong might be the best card trickster in the world—but none of them are satisfied. Each can captivate a crowd, but how long can they chase their dreams and at what cost? Following the artists on and off the stage, Magicians: Life in the Impossible captures the sacrifices, the obsessive drive, and the very real possibility of losing everything for the one true love of their lives.","popularity":0.1672,"poster_path":"/boVt0fLJec3uDLDYSkjie02VkxG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magicians: Life in the Impossible","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":26,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Vite da maghi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Armstrong","original_name":"Jon Armstrong","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"58806c1892514134c10068a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Gillis","original_name":"Brian Gillis","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"58806c2492514134c40066b8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Minkin","original_name":"David Minkin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"himself","credit_id":"58806c2f92514134be006715","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1741593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Rouven","original_name":"Jan Rouven","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"himself","credit_id":"58806c3c92514134cd006753","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Alfter","original_name":"Frank Alfter","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"himself","credit_id":"58806c5ac3a36831090068bc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcie Hume","original_name":"Marcie Hume","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635501454ca676007a537f4f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1613648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Baaden","original_name":"Christoph Baaden","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5725f5d5c3a36842d1000529","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3433160","wikidata_id":"Q50314173","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/doAWdt8U8kvKDgLslfxsJeIFazK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.649,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/boVt0fLJec3uDLDYSkjie02VkxG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":649}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs Film Festival","release_date":"2016-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Palm Springs International Film Festival","release_date":"2017-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
