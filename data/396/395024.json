Their den, a burrow thatâ€™s borrowed from the meerkats, provides underground shelter and the foxes wait out the long, dry months, determined to survive.  It is a lean time between rains and our bat-eared fox family must outsmart hungry Jackals, Cheetahs and Lions. Their super sensitive ears alert them to predators and help them find food.","popularity":0.2894,"poster_path":"/uw18DGQnTHRZPwkSQbG2bVvu2ip.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foxes of the Kalahari","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynne Richardson","original_name":"Lynne Richardson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d6bfe40247edc29e66003e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276656,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Philip Richardson","original_name":"Philip Richardson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d6c00873f2ceb0db8dd71f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uw18DGQnTHRZPwkSQbG2bVvu2ip.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1997-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
