It's the tale of brassy Yorkshireman John Morgan's (played by Dewsbury's Beckett Bould) quest to convince an MP to finance a film about pit life. Threading stories about safety and technology with sketches of miners' hobbies, it's a holistic portrait of Barnsley pitmen.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76227,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hamper Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1932-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Diamonds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beckett Bould","original_name":"Beckett Bould","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"John Morgan","credit_id":"5725ec3a9251411a14004f86","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennie Stevens","original_name":"Jennie Stevens","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mrs. Morgan","credit_id":"5725ec53c3a36838410011bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Astridge","original_name":"Norman Astridge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"John Martin MP","credit_id":"5725ec71c3a368305a003e8e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554879,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jenny Morgan","original_name":"Jenny Morgan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Child","credit_id":"5725ec85925141778200249f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613641,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Hanmer","original_name":"Charles Hanmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5725ed0692514177820024ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613641,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Hanmer","original_name":"Charles Hanmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c63788c3a36813a903e672","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613641,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Hanmer","original_name":"Charles Hanmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c637b39251415b8703e558","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0149900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1932-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
