It shows the Nazi war criminal’s last years in Argentina and the “heroic search” of the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency and a tragic love story: Romeo and Juliet of the twentieth century, a Nazi Romeo and a Jewish Juliet. Klaus is Adolf Eichmann’s son and Silvia, the daughter of Lothar Hermann, a survivor of the Shoah. The docudrama is based on material from the Mossad and is given many laurels around the whole world. And suddenly, Liliana Hermann, grandniece of Lothar Hermann, is protesting: “Your praised docudrama is lousy disinformation”.  In her new documentary, Gaby Weber investigated about the early days of Zionism in Germany, Eichmann´s role and about his citizenship. Her conclusion: At the time of his arrest, he had the Israeli citizenship and there was no “heroic kidnapping” by the Mossad, but a legal expulsion by Argentinean officials in May 1960.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disinformation - the wanted historical lie of Mossad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Desinformation - Ein Lehrstück über die erwünschte Geschichte","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2969668,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gaby Weber","original_name":"Gaby Weber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Speaker","credit_id":"62fcef2b94d8a80082327633","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2969668,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gaby Weber","original_name":"Gaby Weber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fcd46775110d0081be8803","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2969668,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gaby Weber","original_name":"Gaby Weber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fcd76d74d6c0007ec74786","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
