An unforgettable combination, brothers Ron and Russell Mael have proved themselves masters of unusual but addictive melodies, clever lyrics and spectacular arrangements.  The (2006) concert from the London Forum delivered hits from throughout Sparks career including; Amateur Hour, Never Turn Your Back On Mother Earth, Something For The Girl With Everything, Number One Song In Heaven, Tryouts For The Human Race Tips For Teens and Funny Face.  This DVD package comes fully loaded with the unforgettable live concert, extended interviews and video diaries from Japan.","popularity":0.1739,"poster_path":"/1ne3SlkVjqUpf8Ww05MlV8EWxTP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29604,"logo_path":null,"name":"Liberation Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sparks Live performance at the London Forum on 30th September 2006","title":"Sparks - Dee Vee Dee","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":961004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Mael","original_name":"Russell Mael","popularity":0.2466,"profile_path":"/bD8deNHzbb6gUsKLlPDrFVllEKw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f2da486dbf14400351074cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":960067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Mael","original_name":"Ron Mael","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/A4pftIQASbhOsjapaNbrq5FtHIo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f2da48daf58cb0034b38d3e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1814964,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dean Menta","original_name":"Dean Menta","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/do41A4KF7SS6Ew54g38NgU3435o.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670e9a60b15d97b1a93da8d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1836473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tammy Glover","original_name":"Tammy Glover","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/s5fMp2h2SY31WSrO4DZz40vHAEz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670e9a99b15d97b1a93da905","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1ne3SlkVjqUpf8Ww05MlV8EWxTP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":212,"name":"london, england"},{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
