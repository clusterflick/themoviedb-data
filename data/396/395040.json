Buck owns a prosperous steel mill and they make a very good living, but he is ambitious and wants more. To this end, he is devoting considerable amounts of time to expanding his finances -- and doing quite well. Not satisfied with his success, he journeys to New York, where his wrangling further increases his bank account. Unfortunately, his stock with his wife is dropping steadily. Jealous and unhappy, she fights back by giving one of Buck's business rivals details about what he is up to.","popularity":0.2889,"poster_path":"/s4N9FamQF8Lggc7jXHX1XIkMG8s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"HE WANTED POWER---SHE WANTED LOVE!","title":"Master of Men","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Holt","original_name":"Jack Holt","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/4xfh3Mlpqx8tZ991rhVTov0ILtN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Buck Garrett","credit_id":"57221e7492514149f30006a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fay Wray","original_name":"Fay Wray","popularity":0.5033,"profile_path":"/zE36ekZdFQ53Bvk5JauwIeOeKlR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kay Walling","credit_id":"57221e7fc3a3685ff100095a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Connolly","original_name":"Walter Connolly","popularity":0.2035,"profile_path":"/mJB6tVqIlr5zhiSqCx2Vl0Kr6Nw.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sam Parker","credit_id":"57221e8ac3a36811930032ac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Berton Churchill","original_name":"Berton Churchill","popularity":0.2822,"profile_path":"/xBJ2nc9DMFRLlyxhRXCymsGj9Y5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mr. Walling","credit_id":"57221e95c3a3681181003c51","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore von Eltz","original_name":"Theodore von Eltz","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/nq3mPGbn5iqyojutuUam8NXil5A.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Grenaker","credit_id":"57221ea0c3a36845b0000227","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34796,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lambert Hillyer","original_name":"Lambert Hillyer","popularity":0.3109,"profile_path":"/yR1IxGp1C8VXhnmYIDUcmZsDaly.jpg","credit_id":"57221e3bc3a3685ff100094c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50765,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chester Erskine","original_name":"Chester Erskine","popularity":0.3109,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57221e45c3a3681181003c47","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67428,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Seton I.
