He was a child prodigy but the man behind the violin was harder to know. Endlessly touring and crossing continents and cultures, his contract with EMI was the longest in the history of the music industry. He took classical music out of the concert hall because he believed music was for everyone and had the power to change lives. An impassioned idealist, Yehudi wanted to give more to the world - he became a tireless fighter for humanitarian issues he believed in.  In this film, commemorating the 100th year of his birth, family and close friends recall his extraordinary musical life, in which he embraced jazz and Indian ragas as much as Bach, Beethoven and Bartok. And incredible home movies take us on an intimate behind-the-scenes journey from his childhood in California, to meeting gypsies in Romania and travelling to India and beyond.","popularity":0.097,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":76137,"logo_path":null,"name":"1212 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Commemorating the 100th year of his birth,","title":"Yehudi Menuhin: Who Was Yehudi?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clemency Burton-Hill","original_name":"Clemency Burton-Hill","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/4luFvCdVBepFzhUNpTdPISSdGyp.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"57cae41ec3a3685c250037f7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zamira Benthall","original_name":"Zamira Benthall","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5722e7bec3a36875ed001412","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krov Menuhin","original_name":"Krov Menuhin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5722e7f9c3a3687660001435","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tasmin Little","original_name":"Tasmin Little","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5722e848c3a368759c0014fb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Hope","original_name":"Daniel Hope","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5722e8759251417688001363","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Back","original_name":"Gordon Back","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5722e8eb9251416444000673","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Hope","original_name":"Christopher Hope","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5722e9099251414bc7000aac","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anoushka Shankar","original_name":"Anoushka Shankar","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":"/pj0YrikaOtxgy6d7nG8jr9wqYif.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5722e94d9251413eac00183f","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612541,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Veal","original_name":"John Veal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5722e652c3a368759c0014a3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612554,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emma Cahusac","original_name":"Emma Cahusac","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5722ea72c3a36876600014a6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Maycock","original_name":"James Maycock","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cae2a5c3a3680608002f26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Maycock","original_name":"James Maycock","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cae2ad9251411ac50037a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565404,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philip Armstrong Dampier","original_name":"Philip Armstrong Dampier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cae35fc3a3687273003179","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5743106","wikidata_id":"Q24734342","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
