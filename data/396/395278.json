Robert Gagno has all these traits. It might explain why he surged from a complete unknown to one of the world's best players in five years. The achievement is even more impressive considering he was diagnosed with autism at age three. His success on the pinball circuit made him part of a community that provided acceptance and encouragement. With his parents' support and determination, Robert has exceeded every expectation placed upon him. As he approaches adulthood, his next challenge is to become more self-sufficient and gain his independence. From high-stakes tournaments across the continent to his day-to-day search for employment, we follow Robert's persistent progression to overcome obstacles and manage the highs of success and lows of falling short. In Wizard Mode, flashing lights and triple combos highlight an outstanding individual who continues to beat the odds and set records.","popularity":0.3493,"poster_path":"/p8bwvNPVqhd27tH6Dy9PVZ9qml7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76343,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salazar Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wizard Mode","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1614818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Gagno","original_name":"Robert Gagno","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5728f78b92514172c80001a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1775133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurizio Gagno","original_name":"Maurizio Gagno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58c588779251411d30001c30","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1775134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathy Gagno","original_name":"Kathy Gagno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"58c58889c3a368413b001c44","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Petry","original_name":"Jeff Petry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57235343c3a3682d200028fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Drillot","original_name":"Nathan Drillot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57235337c3a368646c00176c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205437,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Greg Ng","original_name":"Greg Ng","popularity":0.1256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c589039251411d0d001ffb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Petry","original_name":"Jeff Petry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c588ab9251411d19001d85","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1775140,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Wylie","original_name":"Sara Wylie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c588e7c3a3684128001c23","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Drillot","original_name":"Nathan Drillot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c5889cc3a3684128001bc8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205435,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edo van Breemen","original_name":"Edo van Breemen","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/gPH85EvaBejRf4QHT682mv4lW9I.jpg","credit_id":"58c588f6c3a3684128001c39","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5709506","wikidata_id":"Q24680135","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"wizardmodefilm"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iX8a4IudROzvtJI8DwjpA8FMLSS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":674},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/p8bwvNPVqhd27tH6Dy9PVZ9qml7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1646,"name":"autism"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":10694,"name":"pinball"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Hot Docs Film Festival","release_date":"2016-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hot Docs 2016 Trailers: WIZARD MODE","key":"pYYN2I_-iY4","published_at":"2016-03-22T17:57:07.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5728f6f4c3a36815b3000156"}]}}}
