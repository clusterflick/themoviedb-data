Emotions are banned and people that fail to live up to the standards set by the government are captured by officials dressed in yellow, never to be seen again. The film uses a combination of surveillance cameras and subjective shots to show the last day in the life of this woman, as she fails to live up to the norms of this society.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76171,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imaginær Virkelighet","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2007-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nobody is better than us!","title":"Citizen X","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Torgny Gerhard Aanderaa","original_name":"Torgny Gerhard Aanderaa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The drug-addict","credit_id":"5723e0f992514155c3000a50","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingvild Aardalsbakke","original_name":"Ingvild Aardalsbakke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Collegue LB","credit_id":"5723e125c3a3682d24003964","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilie Authén","original_name":"Cecilie Authén","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Collegue LS","credit_id":"5723e14592514122a9000fd4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612798,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eirik Smidesang Slåen","original_name":"Eirik Smidesang Slåen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5723e0c9c3a3682d3f003a34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612798,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eirik Smidesang Slåen","original_name":"Eirik Smidesang Slåen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c0df311dbc8801631e4efc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0973789","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"no","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
