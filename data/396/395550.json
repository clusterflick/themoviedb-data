Lewis. Separated at birth, they have different fathers. One is readily accepted as a full-fledged member of the tribe and is looked on to fulfill the duties of jungaiy, an important ceremonial role which obliges him to be caretaker for his mother's dreaming, the crocodile totem. The other, whose father was white, is younger and has had to struggle to fit into the tribe who see him only as a yella fella.","popularity":1.4195,"poster_path":"/h9Oftt0M9ukyVGDSbusd3eo1enf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16577,"logo_path":"/qildaLRTmB6fCBM3H7L02nQCreO.png","name":"Ronin Films","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":417,"logo_path":"/w7d3hoHQaC0XwjrxEG1yPeuUhu5.png","name":"Australian Film Commission","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crocodile Dreaming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Gulpilil","original_name":"David Gulpilil","popularity":0.475,"profile_path":"/d5xb4nF5C1ucsp8JgbyplVey849.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Burrimmilla","credit_id":"572611b8c3a36842d1000923","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom E.
