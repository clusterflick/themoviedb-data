The film is as much the making of animation as it is a paper model of a computer. The cube sheet, upon which the film is based, is so constructed that a horizontal cubic rotation and a diagonal pan yields a diagonal rotation. Combinations of these primary moves result in more complex rotations throughout this awe inspiring film.","popularity":0.3927,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cubits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Jarnow","original_name":"Al Jarnow","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/jq6IqtQ8MXvWfhO1FQli5J8omVa.jpg","credit_id":"572855e4c3a36831880015d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612575,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brenda Murphy","original_name":"Brenda Murphy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"572855ee92514124a300141a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1614625,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joshua Pierce","original_name":"Joshua Pierce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"572855ffc3a3682dee002b9b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2998298","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6104,"name":"computer"},{"id":6010,"name":"geometry"},{"id":18257,"name":"educational"},{"id":225307,"name":"cubit"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
