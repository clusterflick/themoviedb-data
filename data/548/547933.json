Here is Willer, the great poet and living legend of the sixties generation, in front of the camera, letting us into his universe, which Priscyla Bettim & Renato Coelho approach as a poetic encounter, in which experimental cinema becomes a powerful catalyst for his poetry. From an erotic and personal approach, the filmmakers give substance to what Willer states...or perhaps it’s the reverse: it is the images that coexist freely with the sound field of words and music.","popularity":0.3095,"poster_path":"/kRIe7lCx8drTItygO1UCg1pGb50.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Propósito de Willer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1501433,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cláudio Willer","original_name":"Cláudio Willer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Claudio Willer","credit_id":"5b9972420e0a266865005550","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2126878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renato Coelho","original_name":"Renato Coelho","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b997212c3a3682b88004fc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2023614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Priscyla Bettim","original_name":"Priscyla Bettim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9971fcc3a3682b88004fa2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":2150,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kRIe7lCx8drTItygO1UCg1pGb50.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1450}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":247538,"name":"sociedade"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2016-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"corrient.es","release_date":"2020-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
