Culpeper lived during one of the most tumultuous periods in British history. When the country was ravaged by famine and civil war, he took part in the revolution that culminated in the execution of King Charles I. But it is Culpeper's achievements in health care that made him famous. By practicing (often illegally) as a herbalist and publishing the first English-language texts explaining how to treat common ailments, he helped to break the monopoly of a medical establishment that had abandoned the poor and needy. His book The English Physician became the most successful non-religious English book of all time, remaining in print continuously for more than 350 years.","popularity":0.1789,"poster_path":"/1vHcPHbMxKDGI8TrEYWiQ0FcPmd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rebel Physician: Nicholas Culpeper's Fight For Medical Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2125737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Woolley","original_name":"Benjamin Woolley","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter/Narrator","credit_id":"5b96a0a20e0a26197e039087","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Nixon","original_name":"Helen Nixon","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b96a0bdc3a368567903d7f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Nixon","original_name":"Helen Nixon","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b96a0dc0e0a26198703b44e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Nixon","original_name":"Helen Nixon","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b96a0cc0e0a26198503bdc5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1vHcPHbMxKDGI8TrEYWiQ0FcPmd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1279,"name":"medicine"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
