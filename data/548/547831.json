This effect is echoed ephemerally later in the film as it nears its end of muted pull-down shapes and approximations of the earth-clod-likenesses and/or autumnal leaf-likenesses which begin the film.","popularity":0.1509,"poster_path":"/cwEB8IKbIMK7RKWxYAssB6pGI4r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Earthsong of the Cricket","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"5b9891cd0e0a263db80042c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0281832","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lbRoZ6LD53U66iORhVFFWqpeBlO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1842,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cwEB8IKbIMK7RKWxYAssB6pGI4r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1228}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Walker Art Center","release_date":"1999-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
