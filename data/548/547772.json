Elsie and the other women did not conform to the stereotype of women in war. They were operating close to the fighting on both the Western Front and in the Balkans. Also, the SWH's were run entirely and predominantly staffed by women. This meant that there were not only women doctors, rare enough in the early twentieth century but like Elsie, women surgeons.","popularity":0.2381,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":108774,"logo_path":null,"name":"KQ Movies","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Woman with the Torch : Elsie Inglis's War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1930316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kamran Qureshi","original_name":"Kamran Qureshi","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/nnWBHCfh2iTGUM49NqbILDIrMOq.jpg","credit_id":"5b986ab7925141725e0020bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2126450,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Pantazides","original_name":"Chris Pantazides","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b986b0f0e0a263db5002499","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1930318,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dr Iram Qureshi","original_name":"Dr Iram Qureshi","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/67WEq9wrJTsV4MbFjWKKxiCdGH7.jpg","credit_id":"5b986acac3a36802f3001f27","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2126452,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Renate Farkas","original_name":"Renate Farkas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b986b52c3a36802eb002338","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2126451,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank McEntaggart","original_name":"Frank McEntaggart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b986b260e0a263dc7001da2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6103106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"SWHElsieInglis","instagram_id":"kqmovies","twitter_id":""},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2504,"name":"world war i"},{"id":7492,"name":"serbia"},{"id":9285,"name":"serbian"},{"id":247521,"name":"elsie inglis's war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
