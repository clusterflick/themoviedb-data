During the adventure of this film, René Clément will serve four days in prison for having concealed a camera under his clothes, then will be captured by rebels and threatened with being shot. The majority of the negatives will be seized by the guards of Imam Yahia, and it is with the remaining rushes that Clément will edit what becomes The Forbidden Arabia, a film entrusted to the Musée de l’Homme in 1965 where it is forgotten until that ethnologist Claudie Fayein unearths it and has it restored.","popularity":0.1503,"poster_path":"/kvoje7xThK0meQeYOqesXvsRbGX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"YE","name":"Yemen"}],"release_date":"1937-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Arabie interdite","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Clément","original_name":"René Clément","popularity":0.3339,"profile_path":"/z8mgHCLlND5B0rNaTdm9Ag1AtKz.jpg","credit_id":"5b9800969251413c61001388","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0205748","wikidata_id":"Q30727025","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/kvoje7xThK0meQeYOqesXvsRbGX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
