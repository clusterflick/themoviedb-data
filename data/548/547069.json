As if emanating from the basement of Any Ever, each scene plays like a hidden-away epilogue rendering characters comparatively surreal--in part because they are often straightforward and ordinary. The movie opens with a less omnipotent Y-Ready barking an abusive monologue to hypothetical subservients and bidding Able to use The Re'Search to brainwash JJ into a duplicate of Wait. Able's work alter ego, Past Jessica, is battered by her office. She is out of time, and by that extension, timelessness in Any Ever is not equated with limitlessness but with total lack: no time.","popularity":0.1289,"poster_path":"/1pRbVDmcg8mOjUZZqL5oJdrmiaV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":202955,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Moore Space","origin_country":""},{"id":202953,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fabric Workshop and Museum","origin_country":""},{"id":202954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goetz Collection","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Temp Stop","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Temp Stop (Re'Search Wait'S)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4132522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howie Bierbaum","original_name":"Howie Bierbaum","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Collection 1","credit_id":"6499d5abbbd0b001066fd3fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":934032,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.
