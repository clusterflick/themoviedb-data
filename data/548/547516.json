Through her encounters with a parched landscape and beings both physical and metaphysical (including a virtual labyrinth of mounds, geisha dancers and her pious lace-maker double, Alma), Proud Flesh is no mere re-visioning of the American Western. It is a meditation on the iconography and gestures contained within the genre itself.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/1OpntdWg50PTTAHS60jkX0UJXAk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Proud Flesh","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2125566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inge-Lise Sheppard","original_name":"Inge-Lise Sheppard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b9667e3925141431c031d36","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2125563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiara Giovando","original_name":"Chiara Giovando","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9667d29251414335034b5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2125565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jenny Graf Sheppard","original_name":"Jenny Graf Sheppard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b9667db0e0a26197e034f4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1352768","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.643,"height":823,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1OpntdWg50PTTAHS60jkX0UJXAk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
