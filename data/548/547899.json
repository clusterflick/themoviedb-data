It is that in becoming so accessible and authentic through its refusal to be anything but itself - emulsion grain seen in color and movement - the film for most viewers is likely to be impenetrable ... the film begins to evoke a quiet flow of thought. That thought, however, is repeatedly returned to the light perceived on the screen as the film calls attention to itself through the random appearances of scratches, becoming simply and pleasantly what it is, refreshingly nothing more.\" - Anthony Bannon, Buffalo Evening News","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/uTlzH3hU5KE99usIBtKlEvUfxYX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Axiomatic Granularity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Sharits","original_name":"Paul Sharits","popularity":0.339,"profile_path":"/mlXPqhayQYvLv0sUQgOqXXiWS56.jpg","credit_id":"5b992939c3a36802eb00e80d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2149920","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.512,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uTlzH3hU5KE99usIBtKlEvUfxYX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Elgin Cinema, New York","release_date":"1973-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
