Her dance is visually 'echoed' by close-up superimpositions of her arms, legs, and feet, and then later by her distant figure seeming to mimic and/or perhaps to control her foregrounded, cometimes back-lit, image. She often pauses thoughtfully in her dance, breaks step, walks away, etc., defining the perimeters of the dance. Finally she appears naked, midst dance, and takes heraldic stance at end.","popularity":0.1091,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"5b9892a60e0a263dba004606","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0277654","wikidata_id":"Q55150776","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
