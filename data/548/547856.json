The film lies at the fringe of the expanding Indian city, a world of continuous migration and therefore of continuous separations. It is in this terrain of separation that A Love Story is located. This film can also be seen as an offering to mainstream cinema, a space where we often lose ourselves in the repetitive spectacle of grand love stories.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/a5MFVRiYa2LLLVx6Hdb6TjmYsd6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amar Kanwar","original_name":"Amar Kanwar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b98db56c3a36802f6008174","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":1019,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a5MFVRiYa2LLLVx6Hdb6TjmYsd6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":733}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Documenta XIII","release_date":"2012-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
