These are the thoughts of a daughter who cannot rebel. As a little girl, she spent a lot of time with her mother, a fervent Catholic woman. She would have rather spent time with her father, but he was busy hiding an extra-marital affair everyone knew but kept quiet about. Today, time goes by slowly inside and outside their home. Family problems are silenced, the Campania region suburbs lie on the background.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/gvYxiRv1SteL3tnYXqw6BcoxbjU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Bad Things","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Loris Giuseppe Nese","original_name":"Loris Giuseppe Nese","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b92b87a9251416568002f0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2197531,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chiara Marotta","original_name":"Chiara Marotta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c184cdf0e0a2603853e9acf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Loris Giuseppe Nese","original_name":"Loris Giuseppe Nese","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c184cec0e0a2603783ea10e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Loris Giuseppe Nese","original_name":"Loris Giuseppe Nese","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c184d010e0a2603853e9ada","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8804076","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/gvYxiRv1SteL3tnYXqw6BcoxbjU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":715}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Film Festival","release_date":"2018-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
