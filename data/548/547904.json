The \"Specimens\" are called such because they are the \"subjects\" of (rephotography) analysis: \"Specimen II\" was intended to be the subject for the film EPISODIC GENERATION - although the footage, in itself, was successful, I did not find it adequate for its intended purpose; therefore, \"Specimen IV\" was created and was used (rephotographed) for EPISODIC GENERATION. The other works were studies for sections of the film DECLARATIVE MODE. (After titles, focus should be shifted to sharpen the edges of the screen.)","popularity":0.0513,"poster_path":"/bDrXa0hTUmTtuc6qiqg4x4Ck5aO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Analytical Studies IV: Blank Color Frames","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Sharits","original_name":"Paul Sharits","popularity":0.339,"profile_path":"/mlXPqhayQYvLv0sUQgOqXXiWS56.jpg","credit_id":"5b992aaf925141727200e1ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2149938","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bDrXa0hTUmTtuc6qiqg4x4Ck5aO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
