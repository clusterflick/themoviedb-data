But the plot plays second fiddle to the comedic performances of stalwarts Wally Patch (one of Britain’s most prolific character actors) and the much-loved Margaret Rutherford. Patch and Vedey make a dynamic double-act whose clowning keeps the film zipping along, while Rutherford’s imperious proclamations on etiquette are priceless. Irene Handl adds some ooh-la-la to the role of a French maid, and director Carstairs ably keeps them all under control.","popularity":0.0876,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Missing, Believed Married","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazel Terry","original_name":"Hazel Terry","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Hermione Blakiston","credit_id":"5b98209e9251413c61005479","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Paddy Carstairs","original_name":"John Paddy Carstairs","popularity":0.1283,"profile_path":"/qBEmDG9gfsKOCmJNlUJ5OYtpvxU.jpg","credit_id":"5b98207c9251413c5d0054c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0029254","wikidata_id":"Q24886838","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1937-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
