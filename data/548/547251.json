Next our friend mistakes a bear's ears for a butterfly, and tries to net them, with the result that soon he is up a tree only a breath or two in advance of the bear. Things look very dark for him, especially as the bear energetically tries to shake the colonel from his perch like a ripe apple, but again his resourcefulness finds a victory. As a final grand windup he makes the biggest bag of game, all at one shot that anyone ever secured under similar circumstances.","popularity":0.0966,"poster_path":"/cd9fzoBnnQNbsQA0l1oEl6nOfui.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7981,"logo_path":"/6Yv1gIAuGkHS5Vis4UjnqHhCPWV.png","name":"Path√©","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":34878,"logo_path":null,"name":"J.R.
