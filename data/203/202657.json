But the American dream tur- ned out to be more difficult than she’d thought, and her brief initial success was followed by a slow, painful decline. Today, at 80, the woman who was once Cuba’s most beautiful actress lives totally forgotten in an old mansion in Monterrey. There she survives thanks to her tenants—strange men who she is constantly blaming for mysterious thefts and disappearances. Laura, a young woman also from the Caribbean, arrives at the mansion to work as an assistant in cleaning and housekeeping. With her she brings a video camera and the secret intention of making a documentary about the diva. Together they talk about the past, about wasted talent and lost loves.","popularity":0.0991,"poster_path":"/fXBXKfRPrLYVmAaipIK2m4uqnGW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15072,"logo_path":"/g8IBO8XA7YDfs0BjRcNKnOOtl2K.png","name":"Aurora Dominicana","origin_country":"DO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2013-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carmita","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Ignarra","original_name":"Carmen Ignarra","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a368484e1c771d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1038654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Amelia Guzmán","original_name":"Laura Amelia Guzmán","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a368484e1c7721","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Israel Cárdenas","original_name":"Israel Cárdenas","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a368484e1c7725","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Israel Cárdenas","original_name":"Israel Cárdenas","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a368484e1c7731","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Israel Cárdenas","original_name":"Israel Cárdenas","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a368484e1c7737","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1038654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Amelia Guzmán","original_name":"Laura Amelia Guzmán","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a368484e1c772b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1038654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Amelia Guzmán","original_name":"Laura Amelia Guzmán","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a368484e1c773d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184836,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alejandro de Icaza","original_name":"Alejandro de Icaza","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a368484e1c7749","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Israel Cárdenas","original_name":"Israel Cárdenas","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a368484e1c7743","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Israel Cárdenas","original_name":"Israel Cárdenas","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a368484e1c774f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2473582","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fXBXKfRPrLYVmAaipIK2m4uqnGW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10937,"name":"memory"},{"id":33490,"name":"filmmaking"},{"id":41388,"name":"portrait"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
