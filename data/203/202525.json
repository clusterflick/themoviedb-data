This version includes several clips that did not make one of the previous broadcasts. There is an extended intro, and additional footage of all three band members being interviewed. Other special features include two live tracks from October 1978's appearance on the \"Old Grey Whistle Test\" TV show , 'Can't Stand Losing You' and 'Next To You'. This was The Police's big break on UK television and showcases early Police at their best.","popularity":0.5363,"poster_path":"/dxt5UffcV9e1M6OZZ70f44nnuy2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Police in Montserrat","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Police In Montserrat","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sting","original_name":"Sting","popularity":0.7867,"profile_path":"/y6gpCAf6LTHcqFXEZ2udXJkucAm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4cc9c3a368484e1c6b27","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2987,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stewart Copeland","original_name":"Stewart Copeland","popularity":0.3015,"profile_path":"/dvvrI5uWlNwVJ8Bz6r7vSrBffQa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4cc9c3a368484e1c6b2b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Summers","original_name":"Andy Summers","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/h0vEeD0eFnOKmP0AaYudK8bChAD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4cc9c3a368484e1c6b2f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jools Holland","original_name":"Jools Holland","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":"/e1JATtQMNq3KM2KN8mKUw4uIOkL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4cc9c3a368484e1c6b33","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1124839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek Burbidge","original_name":"Derek Burbidge","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6479e463caef2d00df87d7b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dxt5UffcV9e1M6OZZ70f44nnuy2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
