Haidée - both the leading character's delirious alter ego and instigator of events - accompanies his host untill he awakens the deepest truth of each one of the characters. Haidée's dream reveals the characters' truths, lies, memories, projections, fears and sufferings in a context which is more emotional than narrative.","popularity":0.3145,"poster_path":"/4GzCwFdQwVohatFbkCVsK9Pmgpk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'eredità di Caino","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Heritage of Cain","type":"international titlte"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filippo Timi","original_name":"Filippo Timi","popularity":0.224,"profile_path":"/jfb21HPkVokFmzOE2kT1vnlOgAa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Him","credit_id":"52fe4cd2c3a368484e1c8623","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Golotta","original_name":"Cristina Golotta","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Nurse","credit_id":"61dae952efea7a006a0f7e2f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2028211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Mascino","original_name":"Anna Mascino","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The woman","credit_id":"61dae96d735205008cb5074c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filippo Timi","original_name":"Filippo Timi","popularity":0.224,"profile_path":"/jfb21HPkVokFmzOE2kT1vnlOgAa.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cd2c3a368484e1c8647","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastiano Montresor","original_name":"Sebastiano Montresor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cd2c3a368484e1c8635","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastiano Montresor","original_name":"Sebastiano Montresor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cd2c3a368484e1c862f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185170,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Federica Carlotto","original_name":"Federica Carlotto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cd2c3a368484e1c863b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185168,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luca Acito","original_name":"Luca Acito","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cd2c3a368484e1c8641","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185168,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luca Acito","original_name":"Luca Acito","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cd2c3a368484e1c8629","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1414027","wikidata_id":"Q3819030","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4GzCwFdQwVohatFbkCVsK9Pmgpk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3260,"name":"masochism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
