Beans sees a notice of a ski race, and decides to enter. But so does a bad guy (who looks more than a little like Disney's Pete). The bad guy sabotages the other contestants in various ways, takes short cuts, etc. But Beans manages to tie up the bad guy in his own trip line. A duck riding a dachshund knocks the bad guy out for a while; he and Beans trade places a few more times before Beans wins the race, just barely.","popularity":0.4267,"poster_path":"/dYIKDmWM4EYetpDN8HvXHzab7T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alpine Antics","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Bletcher","original_name":"Billy Bletcher","popularity":0.4537,"profile_path":"/ncapDtCeDsMJxEKFXocJTFfnpau.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bully (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"547f840e925141238f000513","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernice Hansen","original_name":"Bernice Hansen","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/1T1q0UvWl1xO3pmUbUdDIXz6gvZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Little Kitty (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"54c081819251412432000aef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Bond","original_name":"Tommy Bond","popularity":0.1706,"profile_path":"/3EqE27w23CuOiNB7jdyhYN5SKJe.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Beans (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f14be3d78570e00315808a4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack King","original_name":"Jack King","popularity":0.176,"profile_path":"/npioVkO9CuQtNWXLy72hsRw4vWK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cbac3a368484e1c4597","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Carr","original_name":"Jack Carr","popularity":0.1783,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbb4850c3a368136982c3c2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149374,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leon Schlesinger","original_name":"Leon Schlesinger","popularity":0.1328,"profile_path":"/is9gdhtLfaCYwWdeACDgAjdDA1w.jpg","credit_id":"5f14be106262080036597211","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71023,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Norman Spencer","original_name":"Norman Spencer","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f14be1c1d78f20035273aa8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13960,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernard B.
