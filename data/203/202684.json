It details the eventual murder of California’s most notorious Indian hunter; Hiram Good. Most historians believe that his indentured servant “Indian Ned” killed him, a native boy whom he’d raised as a son. It’s suspected that Ned was influenced by the nearby Mill Creek Indians or “diggers”, who were struggling to eke out an existence on their ancestral lands.","popularity":0.453,"poster_path":"/syJ3KI9kmMXjFWaoXV3UBOHMuF5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Murder of Hi Good","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","title":"El asesinato de Hi Good","type":"festival"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Nordstrom","original_name":"David Nordstrom","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Hiram A.
