The series draws together interviews with some of the world's leading intellectuals, journalists and activists to offer an alternative perspective on today's society and the future we're creating. We do not choose to exist, or the environment we grow up in. Our starting point in life is one of passive reliance on forces over which we have no control. THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH shows that from birth onwards our minds are a battleground of competing forces: familial, educational, cultural, and professional. The outcome of this battle not only determines who we become, but the society that we create.","popularity":0.4911,"poster_path":"/8LrvXJEKQfr1pe8BjghA16yiMqA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creating Freedom: The Lottery of Birth","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Zinn","original_name":"Howard Zinn","popularity":0.121,"profile_path":"/8ahVDi6PuHH4bfadaHWYOzpYGHU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cc9c3a368484e1c6b7f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":149288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vandana Shiva","original_name":"Vandana Shiva","popularity":0.2463,"profile_path":"/knwbovedVTC2cAEXjVLvRGWgrUa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cc9c3a368484e1c6b83","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel C.
