Following several attacks perpetrated by the resistance, the inhabitants who listen to English radio are rounded up by the Germans in a prison and considered as hostages. In one of the cells are found men from all walks of life: an aristocrat, the Viscount of Saint-Leu, Doctor Noblet, a resistance fighter, Béquille the wanderer with a wooden leg, and a strange character nicknamed \"Black Market\". The latter arouses mistrust among the prisoners, because it could well have been introduced by the enemy.","popularity":0.5175,"poster_path":"/vkaOM1rUABVOZ4yPGXbO6F4KSEi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films Sacha
