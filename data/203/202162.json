The woman sits in her living room, gently rocking her infant’s cradle as she sings, the movement mimicking the rolling motion of the ocean waves. Many men will lose their lives to the ocean’s vast waters, but the juxtaposition of death and life (in the cradle) suggests an endless and noble cycle. Kirsanoff imaginatively places a rear-projection screen outside the woman’s window, through which, as she sings, we can watch the ocean waves lapping up against the shore, or the ship charging majestically over the water. Also worth noting is that the film was photographed by Boris Kaufman, who later also shot On the Waterfront (1954) and 12 Angry Men (1957). —Shortcutcinema.blogspot.pt","popularity":0.152,"poster_path":"/mmR9rIWPjseVJ3toDabY0oUIWWr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cradles","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2416162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ninon Vallin","original_name":"Ninon Vallin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d86789a5a469000219b0538","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitri Kirsanoff","original_name":"Dimitri Kirsanoff","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/dsFL42uncGv5XktZ5c4iXxEf6PS.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cbec3a368484e1c4f17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5261,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Boris Kaufman","original_name":"Boris Kaufman","popularity":0.1297,"profile_path":"/850nIfw8hXTPcBDRsvpyIkVAeMj.jpg","credit_id":"5ece8f00e4b576001e2a7151","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0233316","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ivo3ceStXgTOeSuSCSKwD0xb8Pn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mmR9rIWPjseVJ3toDabY0oUIWWr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
