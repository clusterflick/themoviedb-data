Her publisher devises a clever publicity ploy that results in her husband, Alfred, head of the anti-gang squad, being honored in her place. The policeman finds himself quite comfortable as a best-selling author and takes advantage of the situation. Tired of having been submissive for too long, Jeanne plans her revenge. She asks for help from her friend Anne Beaufort, herself disappointed by her husband, who pretends to help Third World countries by selling them weapons. The two of them will prove what they are capable of by organizing a hold-up of the central post office in Paris.","popularity":0.1576,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Revanche","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Girardot","original_name":"Annie Girardot","popularity":0.7362,"profile_path":"/2njhI92RBGwQgGhGFDA9wgdGDo9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jeanne Jouvert","credit_id":"52fe4cccc3a368484e1c7525","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Lanoux","original_name":"Victor Lanoux","popularity":0.294,"profile_path":"/AuEzBr4wR5tZONg3t8z311AN5Wg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alfred Jouvert","credit_id":"52fe4cccc3a368484e1c7529","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Rich","original_name":"Claude Rich","popularity":0.3729,"profile_path":"/pFKzxPQsAIbVsAhrDvp974U9Ras.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jacques Beaufort","credit_id":"52fe4cccc3a368484e1c752d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Labourier","original_name":"Dominique Labourier","popularity":0.1884,"profile_path":"/f6YSMuTpczhS2IsbH1iqN55UXJr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Anne Beaufort","credit_id":"52fe4cccc3a368484e1c7531","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Avron","original_name":"Philippe Avron","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/qcNXb5Yoa4ZOtigyuWeP1duFfot.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Alexandre Degueldre","credit_id":"52fe4cccc3a368484e1c7539","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":110503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Alric","original_name":"Catherine Alric","popularity":0.1821,"profile_path":"/QABaebc3RHd9pUczapNhiuP2Dh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sylvie Noec","credit_id":"53d20c44c3a368777500b265","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1319688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Lary","original_name":"Pierre Lary","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5536038dc3a36815ac001aa5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0239893","wikidata_id":"Q3212257","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
