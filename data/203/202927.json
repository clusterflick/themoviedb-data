Yehya was 15 years old and close to realizing his dream when he met the filmmaker Christian Stahl in the stairwell.

And gangster runners want to make it in the gangster world. In the eyes of the authorities, he is an \"intensive offender\"; in his own eyes, Yehya is \"one of the top ten of Neukölln.
