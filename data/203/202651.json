Great White Shark will explore the great white's place in our imaginations, in our fears and in the reality of its role at the top of the oceanic food chain. The film will concentrate on key aggregation points around the world: Mexico, South Africa, Los Angeles and New Zealand. Key figures in the history of shark research, people whose lives have been changed by contact with the great white, will tell us of their experiences, culminating in a direct encounter between man and shark.","popularity":0.5003,"poster_path":"/eiKKbx5pjA2s4jkkCXBRSAJEaMv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5576,"logo_path":null,"name":"Giant Screen Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":50255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Liquid Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":50254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yes/No Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A breathtaking encounter with the predator we love to fear . . .","title":"Great White Shark","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Nighy","original_name":"Bill Nighy","popularity":2.5906,"profile_path":"/acbigDOU1L1vMWAL3Wf0r8h8qLA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5b5a34eb0e0a267496003cf9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve McNicholas","original_name":"Steve McNicholas","popularity":0.0651,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a368484e1c76f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":221042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Cresswell","original_name":"Luke Cresswell","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a368484e1c76f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":221042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Cresswell","original_name":"Luke Cresswell","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674fef66656702a792ffaeb3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve McNicholas","original_name":"Steve McNicholas","popularity":0.0651,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674fef75f08f95c65222bd26","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":221042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Cresswell","original_name":"Luke Cresswell","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674fef85cb1e120ccb5dc824","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":92935,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Don Kempf","original_name":"Don Kempf","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674fef92656702a792ffaeb6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582558,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Marks","original_name":"David Marks","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674fefa3fb7298c11a216538","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve McNicholas","original_name":"Steve McNicholas","popularity":0.0651,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674fefb2656702a792ffaebe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449245,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"D.J.
