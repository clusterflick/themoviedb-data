Paramount apparently never got round to including the filmmakers in any newsreel, but their own film survived in the Bute-Nemeth Archive. (weirdwildrealm.com)  To the rhythm of music that sounds a bit like a Busby Berkeley tune, lines and circles appear against a black background. Then triangles, in groups. Black and white squares move in tandem. Sparkling forms turn in kaleidoscopic patterns. Then cubes appear, white against the background, bouncing; a yin and yang rotate a few times before the film ends with an quick burst of scattering light.","popularity":0.0547,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dada","video":false,"vote_average":6.167,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1111407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Ellen Bute","original_name":"Mary Ellen Bute","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/D9vJ1Q994vHhDlPkgFo3ifm4Go.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cbac3a368484e1c45c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Nemeth","original_name":"Ted Nemeth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jXi8fwyjGpoZrF9TOT9ix0i6nLD.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cbac3a368484e1c45c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0027490","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
