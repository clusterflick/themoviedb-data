When cowboy Monte Hale (Monte Hale) returns home to investigate his uncle's murder, he's mistaken for a fierce outlaw and is hired by the town's corrupt mayor, Lance Dawson (Douglas Evans), as the new sheriff. But Monte secretly works to undermine Dawson's land-grabbing schemes. Monte defends the feisty owner (Lorna Gray) of a gold mine that Dawson covets, although she is suspicious of the cowpoke's loyalties and demands that he prove himself.","popularity":1.1099,"poster_path":"/xGO77K53mIxehM8VXbJCSEUUZKM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"CALIFORNIA HERE HE COMES!","title":"California Firebrand","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monte Hale","original_name":"Monte Hale","popularity":0.1526,"profile_path":"/lnWpg7Ds1WsHhzt7QLpvBJXaUo4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Monte Hale","credit_id":"576e8e88925141244000283a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorna Gray","original_name":"Lorna Gray","popularity":0.2311,"profile_path":"/cdWxxF7weiJuccv7hv4Miw2zEH9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Joyce Mason (as Adrian Booth)","credit_id":"576e8e939251415bf6000f08","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hurst","original_name":"Paul Hurst","popularity":0.3319,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Chuck Waggoner","credit_id":"576e8e9f9251415b40000f59","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1641179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Tyrrell","original_name":"Alice Tyrrell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Dulcey Waggoner","credit_id":"576e8ebb9251415c34000f4f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tris Coffin","original_name":"Tris Coffin","popularity":0.5132,"profile_path":"/6ZHwIj24k7mkJYqcankVbXlKKaD.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Jim Requa aka Jud Babbit","credit_id":"576e8ec8925141245c0026af","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"LeRoy Mason","original_name":"LeRoy Mason","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/xMeRfIeWppJTsNXsXahVIGMDenL.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Luke Hartell","credit_id":"576e8ed4c3a368464600280a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Roberson","original_name":"Chuck Roberson","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/d61PgertplWQ4oi5eEFDE4dOX5T.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Gunman","credit_id":"63e546ff2e2b2c008cd5976f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Sheridan","original_name":"Dan Sheridan","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Gunsmoke Lowery","credit_id":"64960ae7bbd0b001252a1f53","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Evans","original_name":"Douglas Evans","popularity":0.1479,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Lance Dawson","credit_id":"64960b1aeb79c2011c5141d4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Edwards","original_name":"Sarah Edwards","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":"/qhS2kgNAmcaQDy8HZMeAOGqVTE9.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Granny Hortense Mason","credit_id":"64960b3162f335014627fc66","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Ford","original_name":"Philip Ford","popularity":0.3113,"profile_path":"/9yjljmmiaFfiFQdK449ZNUPQdrQ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cbec3a368484e1c4e53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69104,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James R.
