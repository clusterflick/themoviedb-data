A prestigious celebrity wine critic is coming to the area and everyone is trying to make sure their wine ends up on his golden palate. A diverse group of characters inhabits this region, ranging from a fiercely independent \"one man show\" to an established 'family' winery where the word family is a registered trademark. An eccentric \"rich kid\" attempts to make his mark in his fathers newly acquired vineyard and \"two marketing\" executives are determined to tap into new markets with an edgy high-concept label. We follow this group through the toils of harvest, and their quest for recognition leading to the Golden Harvest Gala!","popularity":0.0915,"poster_path":"/1uYEQMqZPLpJsynZRtwdTCpTTDf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74434,"logo_path":null,"name":"28 Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The wine country state of mind.","title":"Corked","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross Clenenden","original_name":"Ross Clenenden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Donald Smythe","credit_id":"52fe4cd4c3a368484e1c8b35","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Finch","original_name":"Martha Finch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Officer Pawlowicz","credit_id":"52fe4cd4c3a368484e1c8b39","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185889,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian A.
