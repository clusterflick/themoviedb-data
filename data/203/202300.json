But first they have to get there, and the train conductor won't let the ostrich board. Porky sneaks her on. She gets loose and eats a sleeping woman's wig, a boy's toy airplane, and a concertina. Porky hides her in a guitar case, but she gets out as the conductor comes by, and they are both thrown off. They enlist a hand cart and a cow to outrun the train.","popularity":0.1347,"poster_path":"/yR7g49CEt22paTjFts1ZWwpZ5EA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Porky's Pet","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Dougherty","original_name":"Joe Dougherty","popularity":0.1444,"profile_path":"/2ctdBlXSu5vmUb9L6taTUcVRQff.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Porky Pig (voice)","credit_id":"6232b3906743fa0077ef95ce","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack King","original_name":"Jack King","popularity":0.176,"profile_path":"/npioVkO9CuQtNWXLy72hsRw4vWK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cc3c3a368484e1c5a87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0028126","wikidata_id":"Q12126931","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":731,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jNeYKM96LuGmgTvRmH0F55v97cu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yR7g49CEt22paTjFts1ZWwpZ5EA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/30Eo6UMNH8trjNv0FKEVskdb7HR.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b9Us7lLwos2Q7g7wPgROfjxO9GE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
