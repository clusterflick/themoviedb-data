It is home to a landscape with the world’s highest concentration of geysers and thermal springs, as well as being famous for its herds of bison that roam the plateaus of the highlands.The herds are often accompanied by wolves, which were reintroduced to the Yellowstone National Park around ten years ago. Black bears, beavers and wapitis also inhabit the park, which the locals affectionately refer to as “The Yellowstone”.A park justifiably recognised by UNESCO as a World Natural Heritage Site. After all, in addition to its impressive flora and fauna, the national park provides us with an insight into the history of the Earth’s origins. It transports visitors back into a time when volcanoes and the forces of Mother Nature once shaped our world.","popularity":0.1538,"poster_path":"/u9FYbD1bao1H9I09P0WwfCaJ0pE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24043,"logo_path":null,"name":"KSM GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"World Natural Heritage USA: Yellowstone National Park","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"World Natural Heritage USA 3D Yellowstone Nationalpark","type":"Alternative"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"World Natural Heritage USA Yellowstone Nationalpark","type":"Alternative"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"A világ természeti öröksége Amerikában: A Yellowstone Nemzeti Park","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1097809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norbert Vander","original_name":"Norbert Vander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551b665e9251414af6001829","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1097809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norbert Vander","original_name":"Norbert Vander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551b66589251414ae400176a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12005454","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y0bovCWh8xdh4rLQuO4hWvJAEvk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s1BVEHnXCB0NcvlI0V5ClvgwpIw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kOcLSXlRIq6qMSx3lhQuac8vX7o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u7Sy8oAQUD15jte0FULidvF4fxY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/cM3vmzp0chbc4suBN7wVsOXEGxX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u9FYbD1bao1H9I09P0WwfCaJ0pE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/s9oIS7Uy0L6ExMX7Qs1jmOs3kPx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/6xvoBzZuGOIp42ivokOOchSQVQS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dM4D7suZJsgvpMFNbrXub27BBK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer - WORLD NATURAL HERITAGE USA 3D: YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK (2013)","key":"Jkg-MHYUgvQ","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-01-22T16:31:59.000Z","id":"6312ff5b0fb398007b38b0c0"}]}}}
