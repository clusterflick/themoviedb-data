My parents did not know how to cope with the loss of their child and the entire family experienced indescribable pain. Phantom Limb uses this personal story as a point of departure. Whether it is a loss through death or divorce, the stages of grieving are the same. Individuals often go through denial, anger, bargaining, depression and, ultimately, some kind of acceptance, in order to heal. The film is loosely structured according to these stages. Interspersed throughout this poetic documentary are interviews with a cemetery owner, a phantom limb patient and an author of a book about evidence for life after death. Phantom Limb reminds viewers that while grief is painful and isolating, it is a reminder to each of us that life is impermanent. - Jay Rosenblatt","popularity":0.2951,"poster_path":"/9DB6jrL253mSj83ppJjvFOhMFfi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phantom Limb","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beverly Berning","original_name":"Beverly Berning","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"52fe4cc8c3a368484e1c68db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyler Cassity","original_name":"Tyler Cassity","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cc8c3a368484e1c68df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Cornet","original_name":"Chris Cornet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cc8c3a368484e1c68e3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1020635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Rosenblatt","original_name":"Jay Rosenblatt","popularity":0.1004,"profile_path":"/zUm6HFG4SpXs6gXmdVaQRKjeFWA.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cc8c3a368484e1c68d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20230,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arvo Pärt","original_name":"Arvo Pärt","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/bq7OliFL8gf9ERIck9jhPivfv7z.jpg","credit_id":"641c834df9aa4700b152aae5","department":"Sound","job":"Additional Soundtrack"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0464148","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9DB6jrL253mSj83ppJjvFOhMFfi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema","release_date":"2010-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"San Francisco Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2005-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
