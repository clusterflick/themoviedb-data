The documentary describes a world moving simultaneously in two opposing directions.

At the same time, all around the world people are resisting those policies, demanding a re-regulation of trade and finance - and, far from the old institutions of power, they're starting to forge a very different future. Communities are coming together to re-build more human scale, ecological economies based on a new paradigm - an economics of localization.","popularity":0.2847,"poster_path":"/vrtjJdRedtF3Dfa61IRXMhfadAi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Economics of Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1003054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Norberg-Hodge","original_name":"Helena Norberg-Hodge","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":"/dENqhH0sqB2rypUOlff6cauqeSD.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cd4c3a368484e1c8bc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1003056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Gorelick","original_name":"Steven Gorelick","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cd4c3a368484e1c8bcd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":118347,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Page","original_name":"John Page","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cd4c3a368484e1c8bd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1687905","wikidata_id":"Q12117142","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2NC8cVlxacWZwH7zzv2qtm9Qsw3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xZdQxTBHr4jsH1Iu7OqISLOVEiA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vrtjJdRedtF3Dfa61IRXMhfadAi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":708}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Economics of Happiness - Official Trailer","key":"VkdnFYDbiBE","published_at":"2010-11-13T20:38:55.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec712c3a368544800abc6"}]}}}
