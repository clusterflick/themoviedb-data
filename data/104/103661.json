A committed tech-geek, she fears she is more interested in ultrasound technology than in what's being ultra-sounded.  When her sister lures her to L.A. for what ends up being a terrorizing baby shower, Sarah keeps her rental van and hits the road in search of the source of her anxiety: her estranged mother, now living off the grid.  Small, Beautifully Moving Parts takes a comical, yet poignant look at one woman's coming-of-parenthood in the age of technology.","popularity":1.1628,"poster_path":"/3piu9TCjELbycMPKvCKrl4xETxj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small, Beautifully Moving Parts","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1034504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Margaret Hollyman","original_name":"Anna Margaret Hollyman","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":"/s4tk7cnp4Y2vDK37RvJ6U02azm9.jpg","cast_id":1012,"character":"Sarah Sparks","credit_id":"52fe4a22c3a36847f81bbfa9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":459980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Holland","original_name":"André Holland","popularity":0.9998,"profile_path":"/riYqFOgYLYH4Hw8p2JYTw5lXGDE.jpg","cast_id":1013,"character":"Leon","credit_id":"52fe4a22c3a36847f81bbfad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":154856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Rafferty","original_name":"Sarah Rafferty","popularity":0.9278,"profile_path":"/Am3yPjKVbGWWn2Q1SB5wPz3yzgV.jpg","cast_id":1014,"character":"Emily","credit_id":"52fe4a22c3a36847f81bbfb1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":155228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Kelechi Watson","original_name":"Susan Kelechi Watson","popularity":0.6332,"profile_path":"/2hVnXxWj6j2R9edchIRsoSyxY5x.jpg","cast_id":1015,"character":"Towie","credit_id":"52fe4a22c3a36847f81bbfb5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Beth Peil","original_name":"Mary Beth Peil","popularity":0.3024,"profile_path":"/dngypOKbFTd4g0frMasQp5KZFn8.jpg","cast_id":1016,"character":"Marjorie","credit_id":"52fe4a22c3a36847f81bbfb9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rich Hoag","original_name":"Rich Hoag","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1017,"character":"Henrique","credit_id":"52fe4a22c3a36847f81bbfbd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1034506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy McCracken","original_name":"Timothy McCracken","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/if6s44c44Bq9YgwWAnBhzDO6CtQ.jpg","cast_id":1018,"character":"George","credit_id":"52fe4a22c3a36847f81bbfc1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Sandwich","original_name":"Jan Sandwich","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1019,"character":"Guru","credit_id":"52fe4a22c3a36847f81bbfc5","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1034496,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annie J.
