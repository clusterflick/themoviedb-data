Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW) is about to burst onto the scene as the first ever all-female wrestling show on television. By 1989, the GLOW girls were an international phenomenon, attracting over seven million viewers worldwide, touring the nation and making big bank for the show's producers. One year later, GLOW was gone. GLOW: THE STORY OF THE GORGEOUS LADIES OF WRESTLING chronicles the rise and fall of this hit television show through the stories of those who lived it. For some, the show was a brief foray into acting and a short-lived adventure. For others, their time in GLOW would impact and influence their lives for years to follow. For all of the women, working on GLOW was a unique and exciting experience that will bond them forever.","popularity":0.3352,"poster_path":"/ukLiNofpuMKQlB5NnhC9mhLlH2G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23231,"logo_path":null,"name":"Connell Creations","origin_country":""},{"id":23232,"logo_path":null,"name":"Window Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":23233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Woodcreek Faction Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GLOW: The Story of The Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling","video":false,"vote_average":6.632,"vote_count":34,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Dole","original_name":"Emily Dole","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself (Mt.
