After her death in 1996, her music was only widely picked up and sold. The American was at home in all markets, as can be seen on this DVD; she plays jazz, pop, country and folk together. Covers like What A Wonderful World, Time After Time and Autumn Leaves are beautifully performed in a unique way. The performance was filmed somewhat amateurishly with one camera, 9 months before her death on January 2 and 3, 1996, at the Blues Alley Jazz Club in Washington. The sound is perfect and Cassidy sings flawlessly.","popularity":0.0769,"poster_path":"/eUB5UWZN9bmMnA3WqsyFEjTqk5P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eva Cassidy - Sings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1233847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Cassidy","original_name":"Eva Cassidy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jJXpFuV2qSownYmaFAe0k9QY55A.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5ab40f62c3a368617e00ffcf","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ynsxkcX8SXIeDgncs80rsBzYnTH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eUB5UWZN9bmMnA3WqsyFEjTqk5P.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":543},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jNzpF2nA1rN5YfaVy9Scar84Uvx.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":532},{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z7zVMeRQW3glJZq3jktwmcetkzE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":540},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/est1VhmX62GQkrSwhz5l6DZz2Ph.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
