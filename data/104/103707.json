With his offbeat buddy, Tom (Nicolas Wright), tagging along, Luke returns to Afghanistan and intends to gather enough evidence to get his old story into print. But he soon finds that the country is an even more dangerous place than when he left. To make matters worse, his old friend and fixer, Mateen (Stephen Lobo) has been hired away by Luke's journalistic nemesis, Imran Sahar (Vik Sahay). Soon the trip for Luke and Tom in Afghanistan turns into a surreal and perilous adventure, a journey into an alternate reality, filtered through a haze of gun smoke.","popularity":1.4173,"poster_path":"/d5MJQNy4TxvybZcQAlrPxgdDbXR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63964,"logo_path":null,"name":"Afghan Luke Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Afghan Luke","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Luke no Afeganist√£o","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Stahl","original_name":"Nick Stahl","popularity":0.8001,"profile_path":"/qWNe70AHt45hqnxIXh4mgPMIbCI.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Luke Benning","credit_id":"52fe4a24c3a36847f81bc707","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":91402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali Liebert","original_name":"Ali Liebert","popularity":0.4286,"profile_path":"/gBqC2pUU7TtW9pdYqernpRivSel.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Miss Freedom","credit_id":"52fe4a24c3a36847f81bc70b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Wright","original_name":"Nicolas Wright","popularity":0.3085,"profile_path":"/cYG8YI40q1YtOAsl5oGWqcUPCzJ.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"52fe4a24c3a36847f81bc70f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lewis Black","original_name":"Lewis Black","popularity":0.8568,"profile_path":"/1Yvp5dwnJ1UI0KtXGNhZ384wTgv.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Lewis Black","credit_id":"52fe4a24c3a36847f81bc713","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anousha Alamian","original_name":"Anousha Alamian","popularity":0.3007,"profile_path":"/qwbCRlPieOyS4fwHfLD8C4j86Fr.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Angry Farmer #1","credit_id":"52fe4a24c3a36847f81bc717","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rahmat Azizi","original_name":"Rahmat Azizi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Afghan Hazara Guide","credit_id":"52fe4a24c3a36847f81bc71b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209712,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Cochrane","original_name":"Steve Cochrane","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/mSQfE7EAmz6ChyjvJyfvJ88IihQ.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Sgt.
