They are both challenging their own limits when a crash occurs... Stan wakes up from a coma after this serious accident, to find out that genealogists are looking for an individual whose identity corresponds to his. Instead of asking himself questions about this testamentary filiation, he subscribes for Professor Starkov's legacy, and embarks for the country of Las Estrellas... Purging odyssey where intuition and telepathy accelerates the journey in time. Dharma Guns revisits the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice fighting with the tyranny of Time-God...","popularity":0.3634,"poster_path":"/dqVtwIVtWQgEuVx5C2RjBl0yxOU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oss / 100 Films & Documents","origin_country":""},{"id":8683,"logo_path":"/tLgfcgUC96znl4rzt8gaUCRruY1.png","name":"Cinemate","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":92125,"logo_path":null,"name":"Love Streams agnès b.
