A young woman named Carmen, while attempting to smuggle Bibles into Romania, is captured by communist forces.  Unfortunately, Carmen’s father was a Soviet Nuclear Physicist who became disillusioned with the system and defected to the West.  Now, the Soviets are determined to force Carmen’s father to turn himself over to them in exchange for her life. The United States government, determined not to let the Soviets regain one of their scientists, decides to send in a lone agent to rescue her, to make sure that America does not have to pay the smuggler’s ransom.","popularity":0.4966,"poster_path":"/qWLcCWJ7xkUBPeayMSyX482IukH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smuggler's Ransom","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Tyler Quinn","original_name":"Anthony Tyler Quinn","popularity":0.3633,"profile_path":"/ttbNUT3J9j89MJULORafj0esn7K.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bill Donely","credit_id":"52fe4a1fc3a36847f81bb16b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Resa","original_name":"Marina Resa","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":"/31c3YI3qUgEv4ZlUyk62z3aNKR1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Carmen Gonsolo","credit_id":"52fe4a1fc3a36847f81bb16f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Doba","original_name":"Jeff Doba","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Vladimir Ninshka","credit_id":"52fe4a1fc3a36847f81bb167","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1742634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Doole","original_name":"Jane Doole","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65dbc33ded2ac2018740a4f2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3751708,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dorota Krimmel","original_name":"Dorota Krimmel","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65dbc36cd465370165cf316b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Little","original_name":"Justin Little","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"65dbc478c2b9df01838c7101","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1880328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Norland","original_name":"Katherine Norland","popularity":0.2476,"profile_path":"/z3jyxHJYNSDxstSJ5f9Fq9f6WWX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65dbc4af5f2db10187bf4e5e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4557621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Payne","original_name":"Dan Payne","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"65dbc531ebb99d017c027389","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Pollard","original_name":"Melissa Pollard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"65dbc56fed2ac2016440a2b1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4557623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Rice","original_name":"Sarah Rice","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"65dbc5a403bf840161adf4dd","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4557627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spurgeon Rice","original_name":"Spurgeon Rice","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"65dbc5cbd465370188cf3a3f","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034322,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daniel Noa","original_name":"Daniel Noa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a1fc3a36847f81bb175","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034323,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brandon Rice","original_name":"Brandon Rice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a1fc3a36847f81bb17b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1074653","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x5aDmyvBx8J67EJmXTAyMl8yJWa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qWLcCWJ7xkUBPeayMSyX482IukH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6212,"name":"smuggling (contraband)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cloud Ten Pictures presents Smugglers Ransom","key":"vRkxPVYGyLs","published_at":"2008-05-12T15:05:25.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6dec3a368544800848a"}]}}}
