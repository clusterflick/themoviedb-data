In flashbacks we find out what happened. She lives with Irene, who's 27, whom Rosie knows is in fact her mother, but that's their secret. Irene's brother Michel, unemployed, a compulsive gambler, comes to stay with them. Around then, Irene meets Bernard; they come to care for each other. This leaves Rosie without attention, so she puts all her adolescent hopes and romantic fantasies into a relationship with Jimi, a good looking kid she sees on a bus. Is it adventures with Jimi that land her in juvie? Once she's there, why doesn't he answer her letters?","popularity":0.2435,"poster_path":"/s7c6mH2yIVz6AOpd5l7jXxqLlja.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosie","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Rosie, sa vie est dans sa tÃªte","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Rosie: Een Duivel in Mijn Kop","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aranka Coppens","original_name":"Aranka Coppens","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Rosie","credit_id":"553cec2292514168740056ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dirk Roofthooft","original_name":"Dirk Roofthooft","popularity":0.2377,"profile_path":"/9mB8fTwJL87xuwfbmKEUUSgoVBw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bernard Vermarcke","credit_id":"553cec47c3a3687db1001199","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1129757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara De Roo","original_name":"Sara De Roo","popularity":0.108,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Irene","credit_id":"553cec52c3a3683e5500599c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joost Wynant","original_name":"Joost Wynant","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jimi","credit_id":"553cec6892514138a90086df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Vercruyssen","original_name":"Frank Vercruyssen","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/iQu7sP27fQu19kewLfghclEhqWO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Michel","credit_id":"553cec77c3a3683c48004168","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1110434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrice Toye","original_name":"Patrice Toye","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553cec9d92514135c8003ff5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1110434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrice Toye","original_name":"Patrice Toye","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553ceca79251413f5a007b94","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44692,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Parish","original_name":"John Parish","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/xGQSIZbgyW2cZc6W5C5SZzscmOZ.jpg","credit_id":"553ceccc92514138a90086f2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0163185","wikidata_id":"Q3442627","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":731,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aOUPkpWJKdtJyi2zNBg4hO5Cbcj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s7c6mH2yIVz6AOpd5l7jXxqLlja.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":1111,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/zpwu0CwMOhstr85g55Bz6l85dcC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":798}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2009-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nederland 3","release_date":"2002-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
