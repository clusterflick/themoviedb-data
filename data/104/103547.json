When impulsive Koni savagely attacks a visiting government official, the resulting massacre forces the two friends on a journey that will transform them from boys into men, from farmers into soldiers and from villagers into revolutionaries. \"We fight in one world so we can live in another,\" declares Koni as the two battle shoulder to shoulder against government troops. But while Koni embraces the politics and carnage of their dangerous new guerilla existence, Djimi longs for the simplicity and grace of the village life they've left behind. As the rebels move closer to victory, the two friends move closer to a clash of their own.","popularity":0.0954,"poster_path":"/2Dea6YhUF8iwEZUd6gMXzVcytBe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7006,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pierre Javaux Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":76601,"logo_path":null,"name":"DCN","origin_country":""},{"id":11332,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept-Arte","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":76602,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parenthese Films","origin_country":""},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TD","name":"Chad"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daresalam","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haikal Zakaria","original_name":"Haikal Zakaria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Djimi","credit_id":"5731f0fec3a36803b9000270","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdoulaye Ahmat","original_name":"Abdoulaye Ahmat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Koni","credit_id":"5731f108c3a3686ce9000fa4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérard Essomba","original_name":"Gérard Essomba","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Adoum","credit_id":"5731f116925141439f00012b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":18562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidiki Bakaba","original_name":"Sidiki Bakaba","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Félix","credit_id":"5731f1259251414426000125","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Youssouf Djaoro","original_name":"Youssouf Djaoro","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/cJMr9eeii1XTs5HpV66JfcBBj0X.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"5731f1309251411903001503","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garba Issa","original_name":"Garba Issa","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Yacoub","credit_id":"5731f141c3a36815cc000123","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baba Hassan Fatime","original_name":"Baba Hassan Fatime","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Achta","credit_id":"5731f14f925141197c0014b7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khalite Deye","original_name":"Khalite Deye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"La mère","credit_id":"5731f15ec3a36816a7000130","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Idrissa","original_name":"Adam Idrissa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Bichara","credit_id":"5731f168925141197c0014c0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moussa Atim","original_name":"Moussa Atim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Village chief","credit_id":"5731f175c3a368346b0016b7","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Issa Serge Coelo","original_name":"Issa Serge Coelo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5731f054c3a368165f0000ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Issa Serge Coelo","original_name":"Issa Serge Coelo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5731f06a925141197c001488","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617861,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ismael Ben-Cherrif","original_name":"Ismael Ben-Cherrif","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5731f060925141439f0000ff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0276893","wikidata_id":"Q5222557","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2Dea6YhUF8iwEZUd6gMXzVcytBe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
