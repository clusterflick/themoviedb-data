Keene is cast as a former federal agent who is drawn out of retirement to stem the activities of smugglers Boss (Leroy Mason) and Driscoll (Walter Long). Disguising himself as an outlaw, our hero gains the confidence of the two desperadoes, only to be found out at the least appropriate time. Rest assured that Keene saves the day and manages to march ingenue Ann (Eleanore Stewart) to the altar.","popularity":0.403,"poster_path":"/ndRCLhn7WbDyvXlLsow1shbByhf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1938-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"BAD MEDICINE FOR BAD MEN! that's TOM KEENE when he goes on the warpath for the Pecos Kid!","title":"The Painted Trail","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Keene","original_name":"Tom Keene","popularity":0.1815,"profile_path":"/y0rkWrIWgTgN1w8FwpsgaIZlZZ0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tom Gray / Pecos Kid","credit_id":"5569d57492514173b30016e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleanor Stewart","original_name":"Eleanor Stewart","popularity":0.1257,"profile_path":"/7T9bOBQI8UAVd8kqaxe9XhrXE4b.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Alice Banning","credit_id":"5569d58cc3a36876bd00171f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"LeRoy Mason","original_name":"LeRoy Mason","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/xMeRfIeWppJTsNXsXahVIGMDenL.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Duke Prescott","credit_id":"5569d5a5c3a368774e001a26","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Long","original_name":"Walter Long","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":"/oS2Ip4I7H5MQhKQcTNXVqMK62Im.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gang Leader Driscoll","credit_id":"5569d5c392514173e000156c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Campeau","original_name":"Frank Campeau","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":"/pi0A4lSUveDrP5exp4sSITTIQs4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"U.
