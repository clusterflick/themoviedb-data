Her patronizing husband Rolf has always taken advantage of this to patronize his wife. But that is over now. Anna took the difficult step and moved into her own apartment with the children. Fortunately, her best friend Maria lives next door to help Anna read important forms. Anna also found a job through Maria's mediation.

The vain writer always expects everyone to dance to his tune.","popularity":0.4014,"poster_path":"/qYc8RLnaV0xoO1JNIctkBQgvWKY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85490,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taunus
