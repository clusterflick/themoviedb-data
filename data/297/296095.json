She believes her family's explanation that her looks were inherited from her dark-skinned Sicilian grandfather. But when her parents abruptly split, her gut starts to tell her something different.  At age of 18, she finally confronts her mother and learns the truth: her biological father was not the man who raised her, but a black man named Rodney with whom her mother had had an affair.","popularity":1.0734,"poster_path":"/xVCsF8pDfCGIAWW0L16tbXFr1ia.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152514,"logo_path":"/kARX4cWjZEjBQ6HOcPafXvjoeAM.png","name":"Truth
