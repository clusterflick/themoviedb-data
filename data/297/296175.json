This question asks Swiss author Franz Hohler. His answer: 'Make death your adviser to live life to the fullest.' He is one of several carefully chosen Swiss citizens who give us an insight into their personal views on life and death. Besides these colorful, oftentimes funny quotes we meet Tom, a 50-year old male that has been diagnosed with incurable brain tumor. Contrary to what one would expect, Tom takes his sickness not as a burden but as a chance and lives his life happier than ever before. This to the surprise of his family and friends and above all - himself. The film encourages people to live life more consciously.","popularity":0.2705,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":34587,"logo_path":null,"name":"Playground Media Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2014-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dying To Live","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Hohler","original_name":"Franz Hohler","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5431613d0e0a265694001f23","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitri","original_name":"Dimitri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"543161470e0a265694001f27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Gfeller","original_name":"Christian Gfeller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5431615cc3a3681143001dc1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Panian","original_name":"Rebecca Panian","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/3XcSZCDE9vTNaJn15RQddwgeR3A.jpg","credit_id":"543161890e0a26464900363b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Panian","original_name":"Rebecca Panian","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/3XcSZCDE9vTNaJn15RQddwgeR3A.jpg","credit_id":"5431616dc3a36811ef001e8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371319,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elena Ibello","original_name":"Elena Ibello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5431617f0e0a265915001e0e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4066600","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":879,"name":"brain tumor"},{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"},{"id":41388,"name":"portrait"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
