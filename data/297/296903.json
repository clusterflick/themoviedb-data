When Redwitz hires the young pretty Bettina as an educator, everyone is enthusiastic about her. Especially the two boys love them hotly and intimately and from now on even show impeccable behavior. Only the strict housekeeper Mrs. Suhrmöller is jealous and tells Redwitz about the gossip in the village, which says that Bettina only planned to become Redwitz's wife. Redwitz then dismisses Mrs. Suhrmöller. But when Bettina finds out about it, she leaves the property and accepts a job as a social lady in the recreation home \"Schloss Sorgenfrei\". Now Redwitz slowly realizes what he feels for Bettina, and his sons try everything to bring the father and the educator together.","popularity":0.0971,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1945-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meine Herren Söhne","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":219167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Farell","original_name":"Claude Farell","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":"/fqQP6CE2UzMwIDm53IFaoJcOYxb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bettina von Wüstenhagen, Erzieherin","credit_id":"5437d7000e0a2609570010b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Hinz","original_name":"Werner Hinz","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":"/wNSIDc0fHIND1ckr3xwLuO87ZwV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kurt Redwitz, Gutsbesitzer","credit_id":"5437d71dc3a3686ede002177","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lutz Moik","original_name":"Lutz Moik","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/69fuScPjo3x0TKLRb67F5K2wq56.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lutz Redwitz","credit_id":"5437d72ec3a3686ee60022f0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günther Lüders","original_name":"Günther Lüders","popularity":0.1433,"profile_path":"/5sKTXAHiOqsrF0htVp2T06MYHUp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Liebekind, Volontär bei Redwitz","credit_id":"5437d7430e0a2617ca002380","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Flickenschildt","original_name":"Elisabeth Flickenschildt","popularity":0.201,"profile_path":"/ve95zh3QgOZqnFhqPnaVqY4OtU3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Frau Suhrmöller, Wirtschafterin","credit_id":"5437d754c3a3686ee60022f9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Schafheitlin","original_name":"Franz Schafheitlin","popularity":0.3509,"profile_path":"/waBnCjhX3M73pKaKDJFRyM7wKKN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ministerialdirektor","credit_id":"5437d7af0e0a2617d200222a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert A.
