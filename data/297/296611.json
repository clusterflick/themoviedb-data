However, Cousin Percy, also competing for Sally's favor, snidely exposes the deception. While testing his latest invention, Tillie's paramour, The Bat, makes a crash landing at Aunt Sally's birthday celebration. Inspired, eccentric Sally takes to the air herself, but after several days' absence she is declared dead. Aunt Sally bequeaths Tillie the tomato pincushion, giving most of the estate to her pet monkey, Jim, and after Jim's death, to Percy. Wanting to speed up his inheritance, Percy kidnaps Jim and connives to frame Tillie for his apparent death. The police relentlessly pursue Tillie until Aunt Sally finally returns. Disgusted at her inability to rid herself of the ugly pincushion, which Percy nastily keeps returning to her, Tillie rips it apart with her teeth, only to discover that it is filled with 10,000 dollar bills.","popularity":0.1315,"poster_path":"/3QakvKHj8WK7yhDCxlf45KgcnxF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lubin Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tillie's Tomato Surprise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Dressler","original_name":"Marie Dressler","popularity":0.1524,"profile_path":"/xRsxCFcdo30PKDhRWXlk8Idwljl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tillie Todd","credit_id":"54353149c3a368109100b221","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleanor Fairbanks","original_name":"Eleanor Fairbanks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Amber Gris","credit_id":"5435319a0e0a26587200b3af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah McVicker","original_name":"Sarah McVicker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Aunt Sally","credit_id":"543531a1c3a36825d300830a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1372252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Lambert","original_name":"Clara Lambert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/4QAVndOtIVZPKavtuC4WhcHAqjJ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tillie's Mother","credit_id":"543531a7c3a368114300b680","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1372253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom McNaughton","original_name":"Tom McNaughton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2uyyDM2MuRXaqm3cRm26AMpCcpz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Percy Jitney","credit_id":"543531aec3a36831a600c74c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":207983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Campbell","original_name":"Colin Campbell","popularity":0.3412,"profile_path":"/8Gni27ZFmIpb6uHwpaoBRvvprW0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Bat","credit_id":"67c043d8834058f16ac8d85e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James the Monkey","original_name":"James the Monkey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jim the Monkey","credit_id":"67c043e5834058f16ac8d86e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372249,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Acton Davies","original_name":"Acton Davies","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54353138c3a368109100b21a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Howell Hansel","original_name":"Howell Hansel","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5435312bc3a368109100b216","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198970,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Siegmund Lubin","original_name":"Siegmund Lubin","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/3DM8v29QNdl171YQeeeo3g8D7lD.jpg","credit_id":"67c043fa740c95a371a24bc0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert F.
