Dubbed a 'Guitar God' by Rolling Stone magazine, Nels Cline plays everything from punk to blues, rock to traditional, jazz to unbridled mad experimentation. 'Approximately Nels Cline' showcases Nels' astonishing range, fearless improvisational spirit and deep love of music. It's not a formulaic music doc with the same old cliched insight, rock star poses and camera angles you've seen before. It's an enthralling exploration of creativity, musicianship and the collaborative hard work of making music.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Approximately Nels Cline","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2110394","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
