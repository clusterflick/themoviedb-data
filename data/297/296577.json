Every night at the door of this little-known basement facility the same entry ritual takes place, resulting in confrontations which can sometimes turn violent. Those on duty at the shelter have the difficult task of “triaging the poor”: the women and children first, then the men. Although the total capacity at the shelter is 100, only 50 “chosen ones” will be admitted inside and granted a warm meal and a bed. The others know it will be a long night.","popularity":0.6584,"poster_path":"/yOjoSQgBzb2q1eJMXLEhc4ckTLd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21530,"logo_path":"/cEJO4W8D2eXoeaWz16PC9SkjxmN.png","name":"Climage","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":12431,"logo_path":"/3m45frhaRCLsCKuMtuj7ZwfGwBB.png","name":"SRG SSR","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2014-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Wolof","iso_639_1":"wo","name":"Wolof"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shelter","video":false,"vote_average":6.25,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernand Melgar","original_name":"Fernand Melgar","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/fz5ULVh4x9lYpJGn3YBPKsusKxY.jpg","credit_id":"54609a060e0a263538000bcc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernand Melgar","original_name":"Fernand Melgar","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/fz5ULVh4x9lYpJGn3YBPKsusKxY.jpg","credit_id":"632f49bbabdafc008403700c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernand Melgar","original_name":"Fernand Melgar","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/fz5ULVh4x9lYpJGn3YBPKsusKxY.jpg","credit_id":"632f49d28d2f8d007b014071","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernand Melgar","original_name":"Fernand Melgar","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/fz5ULVh4x9lYpJGn3YBPKsusKxY.jpg","credit_id":"632f49fa8efe730079991e15","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1196217,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karine Sudan","original_name":"Karine Sudan","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632f4a0cfcec2e007cb6aa37","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3714121,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ruis Pires","original_name":"Ruis Pires","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632f4a1d7719d700825b6b6e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339013,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jérôme Cuendet","original_name":"Jérôme Cuendet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632f4a319ac535007ce29705","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1713143,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Étienne Curchod","original_name":"Etienne Curchod","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/lN9mEnK26MkolJf5ri5A2m6ltZm.jpg","credit_id":"632f4a43fea0d70091d2d6ab","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1713143,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Étienne Curchod","original_name":"Etienne Curchod","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/lN9mEnK26MkolJf5ri5A2m6ltZm.jpg","credit_id":"632f4a54dd471600844368d9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3714124,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elise Shubs","original_name":"Elise Shubs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632f4a7b387651007b514ba9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3714125,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Janka Rahm Melgar","original_name":"Janka Rahm Melgar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632f4a947719d7007ac45dfd","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3905098","wikidata_id":"Q18384620","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4t0PUAQ5vZsCTeepEoItZXDoHVP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":933,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yOjoSQgBzb2q1eJMXLEhc4ckTLd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":625}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5198,"name":"cold"},{"id":960,"name":"homeless person"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":4917,"name":"shelter"},{"id":10794,"name":"snow"},{"id":17971,"name":"homeless shelter"},{"id":303226,"name":"artfilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Europe on Screen","release_date":"2016-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
