The much-discussed ‘Seidl method’ is conveyed here vividly and directly: The camera watches over Seidl’s shoulder during the filming of his new production IM KELLER, and observes him at the rehearsals for his latest theatre production ‘Böse Buben / Fiese Männer’. The film paints the picture of a fascinating and exceptional artist using a combination of extensive interviews and excerpts from earlier works.","popularity":0.0966,"poster_path":"/ryxDHKfXW0JLNh8tJ3w9wiLNl41.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Navigator Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2014-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ulrich Seidl - A Director at Work","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrich Seidl","original_name":"Ulrich Seidl","popularity":0.3538,"profile_path":"/jvZeADVhGC5PytZlRmWqfEtls8f.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54316647c3a3681091001f3c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1113697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Constantin Wulff","original_name":"Constantin Wulff","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"543166560e0a2646430035d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Swiss Schweizer","original_name":"Werner  Schweizer","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"543166790e0a265872001e8d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":954640,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Johannes Rosenberger","original_name":"Johannes Rosenberger","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5431666bc3a368117b001fc0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/6o8lqQ9RpnZ1Jx33IqbW4T9wH4O.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ryxDHKfXW0JLNh8tJ3w9wiLNl41.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1910,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/nbzrvo5xtUvN3qGZQS887tWQhxq.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1282}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33490,"name":"filmmaking"},{"id":41388,"name":"portrait"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
