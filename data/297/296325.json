Eddie likes to tell others how good he is, but seldom shows them. Kitty Mayo, an old-time burlesque queen, who is with the McNary Vaudeville Company, advises Eddie to get himself a partner, as his solo abilities can only be stretched so far. He decides to follow her advice and, while in a theatrical supply shop, he sees Rita Carey rehearsing her dancing act that includes a trained duck. Eddie tells Rita he is a good friend of McNary's, and, with him as her partner, her future in show business will be secured. She agrees to join him and Eddie promptly names the act \"Eddie Kehoe and Partner\". Despite his conceit, Rita likes Eddie, as do others in the troupe, including Cleo a little gold-digger.","popularity":0.4356,"poster_path":"/o40AgUMl00YGblFY4ufvAjTYMnY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Path√© Exchange","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Back Stage Life!","title":"Show Folks","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Quillan","original_name":"Eddie Quillan","popularity":0.3433,"profile_path":"/p49Q3UZigqHlmrQYWa2RTNh6CGv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Eddie Kehoe","credit_id":"5432b440c3a36825d3001d83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lina Basquette","original_name":"Lina Basquette","popularity":0.1564,"profile_path":"/szYQFaO1tNTPAyRISDEti1sAQpO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rita Carey","credit_id":"5432b4490e0a2658b2004950","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carole Lombard","original_name":"Carole Lombard","popularity":0.437,"profile_path":"/bPKG7DlExGyyl76A4OcGhO84P2L.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cleo (as Carol Lombard)","credit_id":"5432b4510e0a265872004964","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Armstrong","original_name":"Robert Armstrong","popularity":0.3239,"profile_path":"/5dZFHqLd8bJri8MpSSjpSOG1Dju.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Owens - Promoter","credit_id":"5432b45b0e0a265694004b93","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crauford Kent","original_name":"Crauford Kent","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/zYq9Z283YTCX5FYaG59nVs598TD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"McNary the Vaudeville Producer","credit_id":"5432b463c3a36831a9005ccf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1371716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bessie Barriscale","original_name":"Bessie Barriscale","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":"/ajsGYDEx28oG76cK4WibgdgtyDt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kitty Mayo","credit_id":"5432b46bc3a36831ac005e9c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Tucker","original_name":"Richard Tucker","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/hMHZdVgcSOyhONnAbXNVSKHDwhh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Vaudeville Performer","credit_id":"5432b4740e0a265872004968","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Black","original_name":"Maurice Black","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":"/1HQfoFmDIXwxE1e3sugCjJnTQQh.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Vaudeville Performer","credit_id":"5432b4820e0a2658340048f3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Bennett","original_name":"Joan Bennett","popularity":0.6664,"profile_path":"/3xKU8SKCytMMBeIXzfZXvwaq0oO.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Night Club Patron (uncredited)","credit_id":"5a128726c3a368628006d161","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":144041,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John W.
