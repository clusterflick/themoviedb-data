It tells about Pom-Pom, a hairy creature that could be best compared to a wig, who becomes friends with a schoolgirl named Bogyó (\"Berry\") and tells her stories about other, equally bizarre creatures and their adventures on her way to school. Most Hungarians who were kids in the 1980s know and like Pom-Pom and his stories. The series is nice and educative entertainment for children.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/z8RocmXC416HzTEy7IBMBvdPMzv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pom Pom Meséi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/91HTmj6u6X1ien3NhHk5sAZFHXC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1428,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z8RocmXC416HzTEy7IBMBvdPMzv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"1980-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
