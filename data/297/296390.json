The human aspect of the story centers on a rodeo rider whose late father bequeathed him a ranch in Calgary, Canada. The rider really tries to settle down to ranching, but finds himself pining for the rodeo. His forewoman, also a former rodeo performer, thinks her employer is shirking his duties and needs to forget about broncos, and bull-riding and settle down. Meanwhile, the fellow also longs to catch the white stallion running wild. The dog helps out.","popularity":0.73,"poster_path":"/scJFYmz3h64lllXC55fcXFbR93x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eagle-Lion Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THRILL to the most daring death duel ever filmed---the \"White Outlaw\" battling a snarling, fear-crazed wolfpack!","title":"Northwest Stampede","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Canadas vilde hingst","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Leslie","original_name":"Joan Leslie","popularity":0.2987,"profile_path":"/vft5HULa1wnW1dQEWd197XBchs0.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Chris Johnson","credit_id":"543398500e0a26464900878b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Craig","original_name":"James Craig","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/cTVk52SG5w8VKLWmfcAdSl4I5NE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dan Bennett","credit_id":"5433987fc3a3685d20001480","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Oakie","original_name":"Jack Oakie","popularity":0.2535,"profile_path":"/9oWdEicbTjfpfiCtvvYuxi0UseU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mike Kirby","credit_id":"543398a00e0a265834006db2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chill Wills","original_name":"Chill Wills","popularity":0.3949,"profile_path":"/uk1BljEiYkzSd7ihp7SJIpBVI3u.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mileaway","credit_id":"543398abc3a3681143007078","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Kilian","original_name":"Victor Kilian","popularity":0.1776,"profile_path":"/ttUYIWR5VLVr4YDgCu9ewoJQSjt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mel Saunders","credit_id":"543398ba0e0a265872006e4d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Andrews","original_name":"Stanley Andrews","popularity":0.4338,"profile_path":"/zAW09eb1f0g4OPtNkJk83ej1os5.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Bowles","credit_id":"590a090f9251414fbe0028b8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":215709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Bennett","original_name":"Ray Bennett","popularity":0.2675,"profile_path":"/bk9RIMDkV9AuS0uRGlcl6jQGVMq.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Barkis","credit_id":"590a091c9251414f8a002bf8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lane Chandler","original_name":"Lane Chandler","popularity":0.3259,"profile_path":"/zwUk9TYX6u2Y7jr6VDEW1NW7Flr.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Scrivner","credit_id":"590a09299251414f92002cff","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":562715,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Polly Burson","original_name":"Polly Burson","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/twMBIpUrPD1btes3vb4RcSRGG1q.jpg","credit_id":"64d7a158069f0e00e46c7246","department":"Crew","job":"Stunts"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert S.
