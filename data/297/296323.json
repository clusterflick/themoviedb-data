The victim, with careless disregard for their feelings, makes his escape from the prison. The sleuth goes in pursuit, and finding the discarded convict's garb dons it as a disguise, hoping to meet the hunted man and ingratiate himself. Prison guards capture the sleuth, and disliking to disappoint the waiting crowd, decide to execute him. He is placed in the chair and the current turned on, but he stubbornly resists death. The current is doubled and trebled, to no avail. Meanwhile the real criminal has been captured, and he is brought back in time to save the sleuth from his perilous position.","popularity":0.6062,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keystone Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Their First Execution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Hatton","original_name":"Raymond Hatton","popularity":0.1989,"profile_path":"/eTiQiDcMhwD3DCE6yINa7RKd5NJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5432b065c3a368258a001bfb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5432b06ec3a36831ac005e31","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ford Sterling","original_name":"Ford Sterling","popularity":0.2488,"profile_path":"/jWwCuNR2eRpgxlRBKNTCTmCVHP0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5432b077c3a36831ac005e34","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Avery","original_name":"Charles Avery","popularity":0.1172,"profile_path":"/jusDHfvZ1jfzF9wNoeZ3DtIuQrJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5432b07fc3a368114300499d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Cogley","original_name":"Nick Cogley","popularity":0.199,"profile_path":"/lbIxmCvhMbjFDne97WFvqAv10KG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5432b088c3a36810910049f8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Kennedy","original_name":"Edgar Kennedy","popularity":0.1961,"profile_path":"/oA8h7AdAUZYg5uO0xzFMQOkc9DQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5432b0920e0a265694004b1c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Hunn","original_name":"Bert Hunn","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5432b0a3c3a36831a9005c84","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Swickard","original_name":"Josef Swickard","popularity":0.1683,"profile_path":"/fvkxWMqUjAmbHrBD1a0J2U4PIMO.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5432b0abc3a36811ef0049ba","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","credit_id":"5432b042c3a3681143004991","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0228935","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
