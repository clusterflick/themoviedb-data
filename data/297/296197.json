The residents of the “enemy” town are ridiculed at every chance the residents of the other village can get to do so.  And it’s no different, when Rott is getting ready to celebrate the 300th anniversary of its founding.  The residents of Strasslach ridicule their neighbors, because the Rotters don’t want to celebrate the anniversary, because it’ll cost money.  Even the church doesn’t have an organ, because that would cost money, too.","popularity":0.3083,"poster_path":"/dr40ttD3pnNWflppbiahhLqjCx6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1939-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Pfingstorgel","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Rösner","original_name":"Willy Rösner","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":"/mbMfmlJjQBa70NySfDL4KBz8leu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bürgermeister Zirngibl","credit_id":"54317fdcc3a36831bb003905","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Andergast","original_name":"Maria Andergast","popularity":0.2469,"profile_path":"/eJ3cBq8BiuVNTrtFRflmxB3Szy9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gertrud, seine Tochter","credit_id":"54317fecc3a36831ac0038b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustav Waldau","original_name":"Gustav Waldau","popularity":0.1054,"profile_path":"/qNucFeS8EtlbSxsQOoUWgpn06Im.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mathias Kammreiter","credit_id":"54317ffb0e0a265872002198","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilde Sessak","original_name":"Hilde Sessak","popularity":0.1766,"profile_path":"/7LxjU86sNcH4GjyOlUOKljwjAcn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bienchen -
