Just over two decades later, the Brazilian medium Chico Xavier confided to close friends that when man reached the moon on July 20, 1969, happened a meeting with the celestial beings of our solar system to check the progress of humanity. They decided to grant a period of 50 years for humanity to evolve morally and live in peace, without provoking a third world war. If we live in peace until the Deadline, humanity would be ready to enter a new era of its existence, and magnificent feats would be checked everywhere, including our brothers from other planets would be expressly authorized to present themselves publicly and officially to Earth's residents.","popularity":0.5561,"poster_path":"/oM9UABUyiTDu5H5FuJwmDsJkk73.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pozati Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":20302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemakers","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2014-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Data Limite segundo Chico Xavier","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Cardoso","original_name":"Alberto Cardoso","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Alberto Cardoso","credit_id":"54329eacc3a36811430047cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Divaldo Pereira Franco","original_name":"Divaldo Pereira Franco","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Divaldo Pereira Franco","credit_id":"54329eb50e0a2658340046c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus V.
