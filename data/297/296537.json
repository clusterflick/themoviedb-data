Someone suggested drumming as physical therapy, and Webb found his calling: at only 16 he built the hottest jazz orchestra in America at Harlemâ€™s Savoy Ballroom, one of the rare places where Blacks and Whites could socialize together. The artists discovered and mentored by Webb are extraordinary, but perhaps no star shines brighter than that of Ella Fitzgerald. Features interviews with those who knew or played with Webb and period footage.","popularity":0.0894,"poster_path":"/7IKtvC5TsR14Lqwh74N8mruUf6j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Floating World Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Savoy King: Chick Webb & the Music That Changed America","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2775862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Kaufman","original_name":"Jeff Kaufman","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64385979ab684900e01af825","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1674783","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"SavoyKing","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jWsUWQKQ0njy84HYQiKrVkv6WR3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7IKtvC5TsR14Lqwh74N8mruUf6j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1578,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aNNZu0RP5ewqv4fR0UkrNbwEiBC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1052}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Harlem Week relaunch","release_date":"2017-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD","release_date":"2017-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE SAVOY KING - trailer (2017)","key":"h0PKcQwLzSM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-07-28T18:45:09.000Z","id":"64384ee387f3f2011200682a"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DP/30: The Savoy King: Chick Webb & the Music That Changed America, documentarian Jeffrey Kaufman","key":"vuX8t4W_06U","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2012-06-06T19:25:11.000Z","id":"643853eac2679600e039c7ff"}]}}}
