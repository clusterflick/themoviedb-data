Traci (Eva Dorrepaal), an ex-model, feels lost and confused. Whereas she once believed in God, she now tries desperately to fill the void caused by her lack of faith. Her husband, Charlie (Clayton Nemrow), persuades her to surrender to the ultimate act of evil. Soon, however, reality and fantasy become intertwined in an indecipherable web of hallucinations and mental chaos.","popularity":0.0775,"poster_path":"/aTvU1muVLFuxqDCP9BDiuSlmIhS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revision - Apocalypse II","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1136351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin Brienen","original_name":"Edwin Brienen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ee9e6c7ff2bf57cd25fa7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1136351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin Brienen","original_name":"Edwin Brienen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ee9e966c3b7a8d648d192a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1136351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin Brienen","original_name":"Edwin Brienen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ee9eb46c3b7a8d648d1947","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1203782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Dorrepaal","original_name":"Eva Dorrepaal","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":"/lIVs3k3QvIAZg8FHeEnW7XeTasG.jpg","credit_id":"66ee9ed06c3b7a8d648d1961","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4954799,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Allesandro Ponti","original_name":"Allesandro Ponti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ee9f2e6c3b7a8d648d19b7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1238300","wikidata_id":"Q820790","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTvU1muVLFuxqDCP9BDiuSlmIhS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
