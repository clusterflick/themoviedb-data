On the discovery that Ming was a 500-pound pound Tiger and Al a seven-foot alligator, their story took on an astonishing dimension. The film frames Yates’s recollections with a poetic study of Ming and Al, the predators’ presence combined with a text by philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, reimagining the circumstances of the wild inside, animal names, strange territories, and human-animal relations.","popularity":0.1651,"poster_path":"/e7AuynO7kXt7FiFx4CBWz3UNXZZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ming of Harlem: Twenty One Storeys in the Air","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antoine Yates","original_name":"Antoine Yates","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f7f982e2f3b170036f45242","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajiv","original_name":"Rajiv","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f7f983cd8e15a003adf212d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brianna","original_name":"Brianna","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f7f98492667780036b2a2d1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Jarrett-Graham","original_name":"Johnny Jarrett-Graham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5f7f98520284200036078791","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willow Samuel","original_name":"Willow Samuel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5f7f985bd861af00377dfdc8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Stark","original_name":"Mabel Stark","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5f7f98653429ff0037c81a3d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1370864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phillip Warnell","original_name":"Phillip Warnell","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"542fe869c3a36831b2000409","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1178828,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hildur Guðnadóttir","original_name":"Hildur Guðnadóttir","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":"/xkJTSLeYZkOqouzflrUNgLSC1lL.jpg","credit_id":"5b8ffd6dc3a36837f400f8a4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1183641,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Madeleine Molyneaux","original_name":"Madeleine Molyneaux","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/lUJAqSoMo4in1R95ngoQXXtlDc1.jpg","credit_id":"5b8ffd9a925141739b00ffac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1700782,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chiara Armentano","original_name":"Chiara Armentano","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b8ffd1392514173a400fee3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182754,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Raedeker","original_name":"David Raedeker","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/iJ2H6wnAQJndLydvbHGDqaZrFDk.jpg","credit_id":"5b8ffd4c0e0a267f5e010e57","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Luc Nancy","original_name":"Jean-Luc Nancy","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/ikPEGCpLgPACSnfDBO9st4XKpNV.jpg","credit_id":"5b8ffdbcc3a3683803013509","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3828116","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2546,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e7AuynO7kXt7FiFx4CBWz3UNXZZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (FID Marseille)","release_date":"2014-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
