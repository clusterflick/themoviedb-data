The reality of migration bears its teeth: Following a scuffle, 20-year-old Koumba from France is sent back to the place where she was raised – Senegal. She returns to the lost village of her ancestors hysterical, argumentative and unproductively rebellious. Now the mother of a toddler, she continues to come to terms with the two cultures; the outcome is unforeseeable, as is the outcome of this cinematic long-term observation. The risk of its failure due to its protagonist is palpable. But Koumba’s fascinating metamorphosis is also obvious, her body and character have taken on a more harmonious nature. All hope is not lost.","popularity":0.2317,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":34608,"logo_path":null,"name":"entre2prises","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death of the Serpent God","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371404,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Damien Froidevaux","original_name":"Damien Froidevaux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"543197fcc3a368117b0024a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371404,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Damien Froidevaux","original_name":"Damien Froidevaux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"543197bc0e0a264649003baa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3800808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2428,"name":"deportation"},{"id":1729,"name":"migration"},{"id":41388,"name":"portrait"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
