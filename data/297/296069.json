The approach is formalistic and optically printed material is used throughout. The drama of the nuclear family is played by a series of non-human subjects - ranging from mannequins used in 1950s nuclear blast experiments, to doves playing ping-pong. The notion of family is experienced as iconic, nostalgic and a recollected remnant of the nuclear age.","popularity":0.0671,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuclear Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dana Plays","original_name":"Dana Plays","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"542fef130e0a26463a0004ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0462704","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
