Think again. This beautifully shot, heart-warming and scientifically revealing film, narrated by Martin Clunes, brings you babies as you've never seen them before.  The first two years of our lives are the most critical of all. We grow more, learn more, move more and even fight more than at any other time in our life. We have to master the complex skills of walking, talking and relating to the world around us. But we are not yet built like an adult. We have more bones in our body at birth than an adult does, yet we don't have kneecaps. We laugh 300 times a day as a baby, but in the first few months we can't produce tears when we're upset. Secret Life of Babies reveals all these facts and more, telling incredible stories of babies' resilience and survival skills to boot.","popularity":0.9101,"poster_path":"/ij3YhQbwkPcj5gL92QPHqQJT2ic.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3448,"logo_path":"/dcA8JDfnnQPMaq8lv2CCiYrNe0S.png","name":"ITV","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":32226,"logo_path":"/52pgq5GxpYW5ITOKzmEVplpksQr.png","name":"Oxford Scientific Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secret Life of Babies","video":false,"vote_average":8.286,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La vida secreta de los bebés","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"A Vida Secreta dos Bebês","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die geheime Welt der Babys","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Clunes","original_name":"Martin Clunes","popularity":1.0722,"profile_path":"/xoCgVr1h3uhES9MnKCoyd05bW1v.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"55f420dd925141666a0005ab","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barny Revill","original_name":"Barny Revill","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55c3f7d2925141667700036b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360777,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Simon Reay","original_name":"Simon Reay","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759dc069b6b449ad319a91c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225221,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Kruk","original_name":"Michael Kruk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759dc2d34244f34b9ee1f31","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691596,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Ritz","original_name":"Paul Ritz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759dc6edd5a30c42daf1895","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4222310","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xW3T8A6zvaJvWpLeqMpKpNvtSb5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nWTiuUCRMaXuaOaQpFVBXbfmelP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ojz72e3IbTpKCnQkDnP2lamjnxc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pKIVyBa51PKwRlGVhBGL0VZHtWf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ij3YhQbwkPcj5gL92QPHqQJT2ic.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i32Riq8STJYrHTeblcQglMb2b6e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/59HrPD4qzZKFwEqyyC7xZPccEIz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/wnIswZPiqXG99xHGyCCfR4zy8Tm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/chwhCUvGxdCMp3Aag0dVyV64qdX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1009,"name":"baby"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ALL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
