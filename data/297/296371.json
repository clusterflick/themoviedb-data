Amid flashes of relaxing with friends, the image of a killer begins to emerge - creeping ever closer. Somewhere within his memories and the madness lies the key to the killer’s identity, which, once discovered, may be more horrific than the murders themselves. Set in rural southern Louisiana Jake’s Road is a tale of family and how one moment can rip loved ones apart or bind them forever. With enough twists and turns to keep viewers guessing until the very end, we discover what drives a man to kill all that he loves and fight for all that he has.","popularity":0.9696,"poster_path":"/pxCsaCm06OBjOLy5by8IubHlHHc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40812,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sitting Duck Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":40813,"logo_path":null,"name":"Action Logistics","origin_country":""},{"id":40814,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mayhem Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Family ties cut deep","title":"Jake's Road","video":false,"vote_average":3.9,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","title":"Jake'in Yolu","type":"Movie"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Roberts","original_name":"Eric Roberts","popularity":3.0557,"profile_path":"/NiWg1TaUcal7xn1ZQeyA2dLd5F.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Keith","credit_id":"54869d43c3a3681cfd001091","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garrett Hines","original_name":"Garrett Hines","popularity":0.1331,"profile_path":"/AsEyJj9sYLFNypvn3tU0teWHm6g.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"548781169251416b9100031f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1390021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leticia Jimenez","original_name":"Leticia Jimenez","popularity":0.3907,"profile_path":"/4TwS9vjzv9LnkBgYkcZOumpyevf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kay","credit_id":"548781239251416b9d000388","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":186922,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tim Bell","original_name":"Tim Bell","popularity":0.2032,"profile_path":"/uVwy0aJxDksh2eXO2d2Im5h9I1w.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"548781399251416b9a000318","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Mayhall","original_name":"Mike Mayhall","popularity":0.1995,"profile_path":"/n80bG7de9z6WmUGRFlr8A6KJuyG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"George","credit_id":"54878143c3a36837e600035e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1799829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Flanagan","original_name":"Patrick Flanagan","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":"/8lYoLVClY8lGh7O60NtNC0GLhTg.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Chris","credit_id":"5d0e398e9251412460b93cfd","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Mayhall","original_name":"Mike Mayhall","popularity":0.1995,"profile_path":"/n80bG7de9z6WmUGRFlr8A6KJuyG.jpg","credit_id":"548780f89251416b970002f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Mayhall","original_name":"Mike Mayhall","popularity":0.1995,"profile_path":"/n80bG7de9z6WmUGRFlr8A6KJuyG.jpg","credit_id":"548780fe9251416b9d000381","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2545936","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":913,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1LW61hEMMCAT52yEZBzBNfRl45I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1622},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":870,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hlKiCcOCOfjokHBM4uE1OvXtZxw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1546}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":2843,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/mtLUyomLPMDxrRZasj9BkHiWcgi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pxCsaCm06OBjOLy5by8IubHlHHc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":178647,"name":"occult horror"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
