Silvestre Pantaleón follows the protagonist as he struggles to pay for a curing ceremony and provide for his family. He dedicates himself to the only remunerative activities he knows: handcrafting rope for religious ceremonies and building seldom-used household objects that he alone still has the skills to produce. Silvestre Pantaleón is a simple, though universal, tale of aging, told with a lyrical combination of lingering imagery and quotidian detail.","popularity":0.0663,"poster_path":"/xJ2ertMSw3cXgNOvLk7k3BHqZ8g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silvestre Pantaleón","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvestre Pantaleón","original_name":"Silvestre Pantaleón","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"543725f20e0a2617c100089b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejandro Cenario","original_name":"Alejandro Cenario","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"543725f9c3a3686eec0007ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremías Cabrera","original_name":"Jeremías Cabrera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"54372602c3a3684d25000108","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ezequiel Herrera","original_name":"Ezequiel Herrera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5437260a0e0a2617c700082f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Pantaleón","original_name":"Paula Pantaleón","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"543726120e0a2617be000848","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rutilia Barrera","original_name":"Rutilia Barrera","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5437261bc3a3686ede0007a4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugenio Santos","original_name":"Eugenio Santos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"54372620c3a3686ecc00084d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372608,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonathan D.
