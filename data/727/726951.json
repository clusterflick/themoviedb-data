Using an 8mm camera, Hamlyn - a recipient of the Bronze Star for valor in combat with the U.S. Army 196th Light Infantry Brigade - documented his war experiences. Now, for the first time in television history, Hamlyn's war footage is being released for public broadcast. A Bad Deal - My Vietnam War Story highlights this never-before-seen footage, along with a rare interview with Hamlyn, to offer a revealing glimpse into the story of one American war veteran, as seen through the lens of his film camera. Featuring a haunting, original score by Joe Maddock, A Bad Deal takes you back in time to relive one of America's most divisive conflicts.","popularity":0.1755,"poster_path":"/xG9aZoIHSpUySfr2ZBRnupVpWT8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137522,"logo_path":null,"name":"WSIU Public Broadcasting","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Bad Deal - My Vietnam War Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2720500,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jim Hamlyn","original_name":"Jim Hamlyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f199ca5447f9c003437365e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2720499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark St. George","original_name":"Mark St. George","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f199c37447f9c00343732d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2720499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark St. George","original_name":"Mark St. George","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f199c4bc1ffbd003270ea3d","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2720500,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jim Hamlyn","original_name":"Jim Hamlyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f199c67abdafc00384cfb66","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10469586","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xG9aZoIHSpUySfr2ZBRnupVpWT8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2957,"name":"vietnam war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
