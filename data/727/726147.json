Discovering a lapsed compensation claim for asbestosis, Junior resolves to pursue the case, encountering the young, ambitious lawyer Nicola Blyth who tells him he must produce a witness to testify on his father's behalf. Beneath Junior's altruism lies an uncomfortable truth. In debt and on the run from wealthy businessman, John Doran, following a disastrous loss at the poker table, Junior's only hope is to get his hands on his father's settlement. But hope, like luck, is in short supply.
