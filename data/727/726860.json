Such is the opening scene of Pajeú, named after the creature, a fantastic character which follows the meanderings of the river and drives the story. Eager to get rid of a nightmare that is infecting her life, Maristela is looking into the story of Pajeú, the now forgotten figure buried in the depths of the city of Fortaleza. The film goes through successive urban transformations leading to the burying of Pajeú, a mystery imbued with supernatural elements.","popularity":0.0585,"poster_path":"/pMMBU2z6LWT1tTW2C6S51coQRSS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112646,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marrevolto","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2019-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pajeú","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2234794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fátima
