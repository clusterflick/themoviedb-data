Backed by his new eight-piece band, Elton delighted the crowd, and those watching live across Europe on Sky TV, with songs from throughout his career; he began the show with four selections from 1970 and included five from the new album in the 22-song set list. Clearly moved by the audience, who enthusiastically lead the performer into a gospel soul rendition of “Sad Songs (Say So Much)” before witnessing one of his funkier extended piano solos during “Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters (Part Two)”, Elton and the band, anchored by drummer Jonathan Moffett (George Michael, Madonna, Michael Jackson and the Jackson family) gave it their all on that Wednesday evening with a performance that stands the test of time over 30 years later.","popularity":0.2099,"poster_path":"/3OR9cCTt86wALO21BIv9Rl9YH6b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elton John - Arena di Verona, Italy","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elton John","original_name":"Elton John","popularity":0.9181,"profile_path":"/9G3k29OWPyZtScEDZEAsFJpqiM7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f15a2a56262080036608ac5","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3OR9cCTt86wALO21BIv9Rl9YH6b.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"ab","file_path":"/jFeSQG09gKqZ0hBu3v82HNKSrJu.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
