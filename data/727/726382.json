Elsewhere, a woman returns to a house she has once known and finds it now poised at the edge of an abyss. Wanting to leave, she encounters inexplicable obstacles.  Chaya Czernowin’s harrowingly sublime work Infinite Now interweaves two seemingly unconnected storylines - Luk Perceval’s play FRONT based on Erich Maria Remarque’s novel All quiet on the Western front and Can Xue’s novella Homecoming - that both speak to the human condition of entrapment and existential nakedness, and beyond that to a will to survive.","popularity":0.0466,"poster_path":"/5yrJ5ZAEKvZHPK5u3e0EqRFXQcb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Infinite Now - CZERNOWIN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Vourc’h","original_name":"Karen Vourc’h","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f16ce8328723c0038d4fd11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1572008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Rüütel","original_name":"Kai Rüütel","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/7wvW2yVReCpvp7SxdJK28BgnCsM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f16ce8ac92c5d00352b20d2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noa Frenkel","original_name":"Noa Frenkel","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/6mL7iAmcgKDmOBghW5smaFwFHpL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f16ce917a1bd60038e0ad1a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Wey","original_name":"Terry Wey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f16ce974083b3003610d7a8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincenzo Neri","original_name":"Vincenzo Neri","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f16ce9d3852020039d60163","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Salsbery Fry","original_name":"David Salsbery Fry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f16cea478570e00326394ce","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rainer Süβmilch","original_name":"Rainer Süβmilch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f16ceaf4083b3003516ab0f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luk Perceval","original_name":"Luk Perceval","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f16cec81d78f200352f54be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718888,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Titus Engel","original_name":"Titus Engel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f16cebc78570e0032639586","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2430,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5yrJ5ZAEKvZHPK5u3e0EqRFXQcb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1620}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
