These remnants may be good or bad, just as in life. But what happens once these memories between worlds are set free? In the paranormal epicenter of Gettysburg PA, wealthy businessman Snap Nimzer invents a new business: \"clearing\" remnants from our realm with a crew able to \"see\" these lost souls. All the while just below him, a portal separates the human and remnant worlds. When a professor discovers the portal breached by a new threat -- a serial killing clown -- the group goes on high alert. Snap's team draws ever closer to remnant world to right, re-live, join, or escape the past. But entering this realm between worlds demands the intruder pay a heavy price.","popularity":0.4496,"poster_path":"/6ge0jTj2w73MJqiOsODmOv6aCTC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137521,"logo_path":null,"name":"Absurd Productions Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Past...Ever Lasting","title":"Remnants","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Krut","original_name":"Jim Krut","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Snap Nimzer","credit_id":"5f172bcf1d78f200332e6233","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1208594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Heflin","original_name":"Melissa Heflin","popularity":0.1468,"profile_path":"/xISU01uemGH5WbgKmKBwjOtb3kP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Deniece","credit_id":"5f172bec4083b3003612fdc3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monique Dupree","original_name":"Monique Dupree","popularity":0.1534,"profile_path":"/aTL28CgY2LfY7BdVwnsdsVJawHf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Remy","credit_id":"5f172bff4284ea0034328afb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hillary Styer","original_name":"Hillary Styer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Anestesia","credit_id":"5f172c2ac92c5d00363623c7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2643588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Byrne","original_name":"Mark Byrne","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f172d774284ea0035337e50","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2643588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Byrne","original_name":"Mark Byrne","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f172d65a6d93100347c2fd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12047822","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6ge0jTj2w73MJqiOsODmOv6aCTC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":714}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
