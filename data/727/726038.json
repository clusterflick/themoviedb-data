The Freak Out List intends to explore who these artists are and what influence they had on Zappa's music. This listing encompasses all sorts of music, from classical composer Edgar Varese to R&B star Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson to jazzman Eric Dolphy to flamenco guitarist Sabicas. You can hear for instance, how the esoteric classical influence of Varese shaped Zappa's long-form epics like \"Lumpy Gravy\" or how Dolphy's instrumental prowess led Zappa to incorporate jazz-fusion on albums like Weasels Ripped My Flesh! (1970), which even included a song titled \"The Eric Dolphy Memorial Barbecue.\" Interviews with various Zappa biographers and music historians as well as musicians George Duke, Ian Underwood, and Don Preston, all of whom played in the Mothers at one time or another, help add additional context.","popularity":0.8207,"poster_path":"/xeMUeq6bBn0a9MeC8ZtGicHWQqA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frank Zappa: The Freak Out List","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Zappa","original_name":"Frank Zappa","popularity":0.2467,"profile_path":"/dZiJTFW4cLaqxN7CFuA4NjSMFpi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f154146626208003859242d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Duke","original_name":"George Duke","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/p56jpfTYsEvBEysxWsm2DotkvCW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f1541726262080035581943","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2019906,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ian Underwood","original_name":"Ian Underwood","popularity":0.0649,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f15418078570e00335962be","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030544,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Don Preston","original_name":"Don Preston","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f15419c1c6aa700377f2b1e","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":722,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iSMWkoFZgVUDDC7fUknCTXQaZU4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1284},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oqpRfYvpvzUmZheNXbULzLTzmZS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o2mZ8HQw5Ak84y0AOKCSnCK6T9p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xeMUeq6bBn0a9MeC8ZtGicHWQqA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1216,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6zskQOxJSfFOcKI6C5fVTnghBx4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":811}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":157954,"name":"progressive rock"},{"id":276512,"name":"the mother of invention"},{"id":337313,"name":"frank zappa"},{"id":338464,"name":"american musician"},{"id":340637,"name":"freak out!"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
