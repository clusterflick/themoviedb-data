This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated in fishes of the local water, which when consumed by the local populace resulted in mercury poisoning. In 1977, Minamata disease certification criteria was set by a strange method that tried not to recognize the rights of environmental disease patients. However, an Osaka court won the case for some patients because of a newly developed theory by medical doctors’ recent experiments and proofs. For decades, these patients struggled within the Japanese judicial system for their rights to receive compensation as victims of environmental disease. Those different aspects of these patients’ lives have been filmed by director Hara for the last 15 years, inspired by the late director Tsuchimoto’s documentary MINAMATA: THE VICTIMS AND THEIR WORLD (1971).","popularity":0.1799,"poster_path":"/sEf6NuX1CJfGMVZDEp3daGvPggI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13569,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shisso Production","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":373,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minamata Mandala","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"미나마타 만다라","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906160,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sachiko Kobayashi","original_name":"Sachiko Kobayashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c690fc58efd30078a536b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616247,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Takeshi Hata","original_name":"Takeshi Hata","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/pnpwHdz7P9A3TCChZSm0r3KnIfe.jpg","credit_id":"613ae1fcd7107e008e2f4ee9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1077301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuo Hara","original_name":"原一男","popularity":0.2709,"profile_path":"/eVcCt8yNWSbGKLWF8epCGpG6YlY.jpg","credit_id":"65bc2cc511c066017bd0ef81","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2721006,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Noa Nagaoka","original_name":"Noa Nagaoka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bc2cdc7646fd0184be6e8f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2721002,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chihiro Shimano","original_name":"Chihiro Shimano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bc2cecc144dd0163fe89f8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635514,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Takeshi Ogawa","original_name":"小川武","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bc2d242d1e4001635baf5b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1077301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuo Hara","original_name":"原一男","popularity":0.2709,"profile_path":"/eVcCt8yNWSbGKLWF8epCGpG6YlY.jpg","credit_id":"5f16871c7a1bd60037dd861b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12735324","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5U81s6eH8NS2iRaAa86oOql3TYd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1359,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sEf6NuX1CJfGMVZDEp3daGvPggI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":959},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2823,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bFuAvwlj9TKlT2bU8phxzlbey4m.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8qoyhWRsIscpkKR4gj92MYw4zSY.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Shanghai International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Busan International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"#BIFF2020 Icons - MINAMATA Mandala / 아이콘 - 미나마타 만다라","key":"EzVAfMT_zAU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-17T08:00:02.000Z","id":"5f6aaf63688cd00036205821"}]}}}
