When the confederacy fell, Pennington fled into the mountains with his daughter, rather than submit and there buried himself in the same place where Carr now lived with Rosemary. Several years passed and Lucille did not forget Carr, her Yankee lover. It was then that fate brought them together and old Pennington finally consented to the marriage, exacting a promise from Carr, not to take Lucille away from him and her mountain home.","popularity":0.0836,"poster_path":"/cso6ItJjG0xwqPaeShVkZtcoVIJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52058,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Destinies Fulfilled","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1501142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Ayres","original_name":"Sydney Ayres","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/1gffrdpSaDY0qHaoLe3BQWGvypu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John Carr","credit_id":"5f1631591d78f2003236bbf2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2334575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Rich","original_name":"Vivian Rich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8N0e2etPMt1wist0a8iOCdGwE20.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lucille / Her Daughter Rosemary","credit_id":"5f1631c078570e003464cf50","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry von Meter","original_name":"Harry von Meter","popularity":0.2045,"profile_path":"/memFnJZxuWx0PYxibqi5JyBhKZV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Frank Davis","credit_id":"5f1631c678570e0032617174","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Jaccard","original_name":"Jacques Jaccard","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/c0UJU3G96Sh1mEjIOp0azEeptUa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Luke","credit_id":"5f1631cb1d78f200352d5676","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1678978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chick Morrison","original_name":"Chick Morrison","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":"/iNvwLe8ZA7icLQyj3WxdncpELyi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Storekeeper (as Charles Morrison)","credit_id":"5f1631d01d78f200352d5691","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":171030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Richardson","original_name":"Jack Richardson","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/VS5D9sFzk4KTeFjsL1Y15Ck4yb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Thomas Pennington","credit_id":"61aa6ca0d2f5b5002b239fe8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1181143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Lester","original_name":"Louise Lester","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/16a91uSF41GXEfseEAz11teyVG2.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mammy Nappers","credit_id":"61aa6cad38469a0028d8b9ec","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3334341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Knight","original_name":"Joseph Knight","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Storekeeper's Father","credit_id":"61aa6cbda24c5000636b8522","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2581005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Burton","original_name":"Charlotte Burton","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/klXAvAowTCE9lLcBc8id3k036hp.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Tolliver","credit_id":"61aa6cca2f3b17002b684db9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Frances Cooke","original_name":"Caroline Frances Cooke","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/r92zixkuVyrd8A4kh4thHZBKR8k.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Vaughn (as Caroline Cooke)","credit_id":"61aa6cda97eab40029f394f3","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2357996,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marc Edmund Jones","original_name":"Marc Edmund Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1631db4083b30035134164","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorimer Johnston","original_name":"Lorimer Johnston","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/y4IvXjv5m41rMBf46c9d3kjeVLJ.jpg","credit_id":"5f1631e451e6ab0038c62c60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0442109","wikidata_id":"Q5265212","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vesw2n00GpaThAcjyD6caQbSg5L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":874,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cso6ItJjG0xwqPaeShVkZtcoVIJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":583}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
