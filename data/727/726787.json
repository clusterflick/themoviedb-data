The downright ordinary nature of the opportunities and festivities afforded by Frankston, and the ambivalence one can feel going back there, nonetheless give rise to a new aesthetic: the suburban symphony. In this case the symphony is rendered in strange hues and luminescences as though affirming Robin Boyd’s depiction of ‘the Australian ugliness’ in 1960, where he claims that “taste has become so dulled and calloused that anything which can startle a response on jaded retinas is deemed successful.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wxXuZ7c3dZUo2Lq4a4tH3iFEJnn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frankston","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Tarrant","original_name":"Patrick Tarrant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f18c8f351e6ab0037c6a5d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wxXuZ7c3dZUo2Lq4a4tH3iFEJnn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Alchemy Film & Arts","release_date":"2021-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
