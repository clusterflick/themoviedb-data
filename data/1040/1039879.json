On the other hand, Aasha (Apu Biswas) is a traditional, simple desi girl from Bangladesh who is brought up by her only brother, Mohammod Ali (Misha Sawdagor). Slowly Hridoy and Aasha fall in love but Hridoy's mother does not bear it as Aasha is not as rich as them, and is thus not to their standards; Hridoy is also to be married to Shabnur's brother's business partner's daughter, Bobby. Shabnur humiliates Aasha as well as Mohammod Ali, who arrives a minute before, and both are thrown of the house after Shabnur accuses them of trying to entice and trap Hridoy. When Hridoy learns of this, he goes to Aasha's house and pleads to her brother to accept him. Mohammod Ali gives him a chance, just like he was given a chance by the Zamindar when he was little.","popularity":0.1433,"poster_path":"/sSgbfNGSJSavIjlhTaDkMjRQEMy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","name":"Bangladesh"}],"release_date":"2010-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nissash Amar Tumi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1682769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shakib Khan","original_name":"Shakib Khan","popularity":7.6428,"profile_path":"/pmJvt5SBS1AwJqMSx6Ix8VtdKqQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6357dd08f8e982007c5e5ad9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1501269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Misha Sawdagor","original_name":"Misha Sawdagor","popularity":0.3022,"profile_path":"/jjWPX09il5nP3QlNOSXwONVnj2A.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6357dd11945d36008238d9d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2090557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Apu Biswas","original_name":"Apu Biswas","popularity":0.9047,"profile_path":"/zTzVUDrrawAJmav0ffF1oUndUSm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6357dd1943cd54008268610b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2051226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sadek Bacchu","original_name":"Sadek Bacchu","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":"/ePCz10D0gemKHq478be0a9FKK2Q.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6357dd30f8e98200817ce692","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Badiul Alam Khokon","original_name":"Badiul Alam Khokon","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6357dd4456b9f7007b1564b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":237985,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Veeru Potla","original_name":"Veeru Potla","popularity":0.3198,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6357dda90d2f53007e319bae","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3412034","wikidata_id":"Q15072371","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sSgbfNGSJSavIjlhTaDkMjRQEMy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bn","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
