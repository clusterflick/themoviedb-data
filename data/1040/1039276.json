It documents the workers' difficult struggle to take over the company, when justice, which had been elusive, finally proved them right, and opened the possibility that these brave, tenacious workers would  become collective owners of the company. Today, these soft-drink fighters resist a system that hits Mexican companies in favor of the monopolistic transnationals.  The film is an account of one of the most brilliant episodes of the contemporary Mexican labor movement, an example of unity and class consciousness, embodied by men and women who make their struggle a tribute to comrades Concepción Jacobo García and Alvaro Hernández García, tragically fallen at the beginning of this historic event.","popularity":0.3998,"poster_path":"/6ibQtVKQ5vOEthx20tP1WehmkB5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125335,"logo_path":"/ydfY5B9bprUsHkcoQHIvBBVvZs7.png","name":"Canal 6 de Julio","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La historia es nuestra: Pascual, lucha obrera y cooperativismo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Mendoza","original_name":"Carlos Mendoza","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65adb0b6158c8500cb2e9a87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/6ibQtVKQ5vOEthx20tP1WehmkB5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/sTJEYx0tuY1Ovfikt7EXEeR8cbp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":730,"name":"factory worker"},{"id":2339,"name":"political activism"},{"id":220373,"name":"class struggle"},{"id":230622,"name":"political struggle"},{"id":239547,"name":"cooperative"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Auditorio Cecoatecalli 1 de la UAM Iztapalapa","release_date":"2019-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"En el Museo Nacional de las Culturas INAH","release_date":"2019-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Disponible en Festhome","release_date":"2020-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Disponible en FilminLatino","release_date":"2021-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"A la venta en DVD","release_date":"2019-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Canal 22","release_date":"2020-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
