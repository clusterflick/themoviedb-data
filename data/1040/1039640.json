A journey through the corners of a space occupied by three generations of women.  Through her family history, the author examines the relationships between the steel industry and the women who coexisted with it, as well as the imprint left by industrialization in the domestic sphere. The film is presented as a sort of archaeological investigation of workers' housing, where empty rooms or inert objects are the only elements that make up the image.  In this process, the trace of an ideology of domesticity linked to the figure of the Angel of the Home emerges - whose origin dates back to the end of the 19th century - and which collides with the mentality of the new generations. By questioning forms of patriarchal domination as strongly rooted as the family institution or the idea of home, the film opens a space for the depatriarchalization of memory.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/8CzHSiQ1isamHYBMYCbFPXkgbW7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Espera & Sedimento","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tana Garrido Ruiz","original_name":"Tana Garrido Ruiz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6356f933a9117f007d85e0b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756295,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tana Garrido Ruiz","original_name":"Tana Garrido Ruiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6356f958a06efe0082e461b6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2875363,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Guillermo Etchemendi","original_name":"Guillermo Etchemendi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6356f972d18fb900825ea4cb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756298,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pablo Jurado","original_name":"Pablo Jurado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6356f994efd3c200907b2d3d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756299,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tana Garrido Ruiz","original_name":"Tana Garrido Ruiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6356f9acc9dbf90082387c96","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756301,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tana Garrido Ruiz","original_name":"Tana Garrido Ruiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6356f9cd43250f007ab73603","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756298,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pablo Jurado","original_name":"Pablo Jurado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6356f9dcc8a2d4007a4feb61","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2485513,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alberto Carlassare","original_name":"Alberto Carlassare","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6356fa06d6c300007ddbe6c8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":840,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8CzHSiQ1isamHYBMYCbFPXkgbW7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
