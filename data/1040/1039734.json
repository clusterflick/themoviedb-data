The 72-year-old and his animals sleep outside, claiming the right to move freely. Bemoaning the loss of open space, urban sprawl and our dependence on the automobile, Mule advocates a simpler way of life in harmony with nature. While many appreciate his nomadic lifestyle, Mule is not welcome everywhere. His confrontations with law enforcement have resulted in fines, arrests, even institutionalization. His story may be unique, but it has universal appeal, celebrating the creativity, courage and resilience to choose an extraordinary way of life and defend his place in the world.","popularity":0.0466,"poster_path":"/b6LfmMCWwEtWDRE6ykxJ3vjfFTO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call Me Mule","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Sears","original_name":"John Sears","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6357407cc9dbf9007f03a881","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John McDonald","original_name":"John McDonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6357409e5f4b7300835dcd13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756562,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nina Schwanse","original_name":"Nina Schwanse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635740a9b9a0bd007e36fe4c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16435568","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1215,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/PVSlCZTmj86JYpIc61bJB2Hx61.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2160}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b6LfmMCWwEtWDRE6ykxJ3vjfFTO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki Documentary Festival","release_date":"2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Eastern Oregon Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
