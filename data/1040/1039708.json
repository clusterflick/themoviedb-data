With pity in her heart, Mrs. Perkins allows her husband to stay in the house providing that he not disclose his identity. Mrs. Perkins is waging a battle against the re-election of Joel Skinner for a seat in the assembly, and when she learns that Skinner has mistreated old Mrs. Miller, she is determined to expose his actions. Rome Preston, running in opposition to Skinner, requests that she stop the story, but Mrs. Perkins refuses and so Preston disables the press. With Hiram's help, Mrs. Perkins prints the story and Skinner is defeated. In revenge, Skinner's men burn the press and demand that Hiram be tarred and feathered. At this moment, Mrs. Perkins acknowledges that Hiram is her husband and all is forgiven as the Perkins family is reunited.","popularity":0.0807,"poster_path":"/8lMoGL9X5P7KdBz3iX0CSoRjW6V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mary Jane's Pa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc McDermott","original_name":"Marc McDermott","popularity":0.1734,"profile_path":"/9EJdvYFJ99t3PgwwwMpF5moApuf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hiram Perkins","credit_id":"63572b0cd6c300007ddbf8d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mildred Manning","original_name":"Mildred Manning","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/lW5ENnNebbCNWzJdt6jPrz6lSkE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mary Jane","credit_id":"63572b1943cd54007a7e460a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Brabin","original_name":"Charles Brabin","popularity":0.2724,"profile_path":"/6nq1IU9TZp0d6jQts7NoGVsbn2O.jpg","credit_id":"63572adac9dbf9007a006310","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William P.S.
