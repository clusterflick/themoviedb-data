Arrogant and bold, he wants to recover the waters of the family's old dam, which were diverted by Colonel Igrejas, an Argentinean farmer who acts in collusion with the town's mayor to benefit the cultivation of his own vines. In the midst of all this, Gregório will have to face the contempt of the residents, the corruption and the socioeconomic power of the elite, leaving aside the love for his little son Olegário, the care for his elderly parents and the love of Paula, the teacher at the school who insists that he go live in the city. How does the one who stays on the land that everyone has decided to leave survives.","popularity":0.2486,"poster_path":"/9v6kvmoel3GvCHJUQ6bakl2vU50.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2022-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los de abajo","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Arze","original_name":"Fernando Arze","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"644fe5612fccee0314cde417","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"César Bordón","original_name":"César Bordón","popularity":0.2112,"profile_path":"/apFmSvAaVzZKGpk5H5yVcJtEEdr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"644fe5712fccee0334cd960d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Bredow","original_name":"Luis Bredow","popularity":0.135,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"644fe57c2fccee0334cd9611","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4038871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Parada","original_name":"Sonia Parada","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"644fe5a452dc7f02e5db4e6e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3995263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandro Quiroga","original_name":"Alejandro Quiroga","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642d574f2dc44e00beb0186b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3995263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandro Quiroga","original_name":"Alejandro Quiroga","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644fe5b235039802ddd5b5b6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809583,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Diego Robaldo","original_name":"Diego Robaldo","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644fe5bd35039802ddd5b5be","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10427666","wikidata_id":"Q115259566","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5K3MaY7OedRdCpo5iXHN2vn5K0p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1949,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/9v6kvmoel3GvCHJUQ6bakl2vU50.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1299},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1772,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/x52VuBUOGXlafSZfFejS3jaLD1P.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1240},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/8O6k7k9rXFH9ijSIlKMTyCQVEu8.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":255834,"name":"rural life"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"AFI Latin American Film Festival (U.S. Premiere)","release_date":"2023-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Spot película LOS DE ABAJO","key":"ab2Sw9TG1mk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-20T15:17:51.000Z","id":"661ca67a0102c9018606a824"}]}}}
