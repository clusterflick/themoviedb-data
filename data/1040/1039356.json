Beginning with paired images of boulders planted in the middle of the urban landscape and outside the city, the connection between the beauty of the city and the natural world begins to form. There are  modern skyscrapers above, and the horse-drawn carriages below.  The film is filled with motifs that Kirchheimer has made his own: the camera traveling majestically through buildings, pointing skyward, light reflecting off glass, sweeping through the streets filming storefronts and daily life, always with an uncanny ability to capture small moments between neighbors, and the faces of a metropolis, culminating to the ecstatic sound of Louis Prima and the peaceful sounds of the river.  Look close: you will even catch a glimpse of Manny himself.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up the Lazy River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","original_name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/9OwvvUNGiz3sKo4bX9tT7txI7QF.jpg","credit_id":"635608c543250f008259f873","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
