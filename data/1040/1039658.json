We see a GDR flag waved at a rally in Maputo, carried by \"Madgermanes\", contract workers who once toiled in eastern Germany. Some of them founded families there, like Eulidio. His daughter Sarah grows up with her mother in Berlin. The relationship with her \"second home\" is slow in growing, partly thanks to Luana, Sarah's baby, whose father, Eduardo is also from Mozambique.","popularity":0.3399,"poster_path":"/hKwUg1RqMAlf3eHja7jXE3EQwo3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film
