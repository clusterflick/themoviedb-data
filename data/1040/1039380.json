Chris works for a septic company and his wife Lisa teaches special ed. They're raising their three children-Maddy, Chris Jr. and Jake-in Chris's childhood home. Outgoing and bright, the Sam kids are the center of their parent's world: Maddy, the oldest, is thriving in her college classes, while Chris Jr. and Jake are both gifted athletes. They are a tight-knit family, well-liked by friends and neighbors, and living the suburban dream. That is until suddenly the family disappears, cutting off all communication with the rest of the world and leaving no clue as to where they've gone or when they're coming back. Concerned, if not a little intrigued by the Sam's abrupt disappearance, Jairus- once close friends with the Sam family-rounds up his film crew to set out and find them.","popularity":0.2925,"poster_path":"/1VwKDxX3MYCAgKZ7F4tgDhR21NR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77843,"logo_path":null,"name":"Argle Bargle Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shedim","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051259,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jairus Cobb","original_name":"Jairus Cobb","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"639621fe7304b500cd283c70","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051259,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jairus Cobb","original_name":"Jairus Cobb","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6356342a56b9f7007e2f9111","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920329,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jill Delaney","original_name":"Jill Delaney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63961eeda0f1a200c880deb3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051259,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jairus Cobb","original_name":"Jairus Cobb","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63961ef42cefc200d1730017","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6159152","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aiUidj6cgX0W7OWg4ngzEjvCgvX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1VwKDxX3MYCAgKZ7F4tgDhR21NR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"},{"id":10941,"name":"disappearance"},{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shedim | Trailer | Jairus Cobb | Jessica Little | Peter G.
