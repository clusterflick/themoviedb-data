In this rare and vulnerable portrait, vivid imagery, humour, movement, and Archie's narration come together to tell his remarkable story of resilience and unwavering fierceness. Both playful and contemplative SNAP explores the precarious and sometimes punishing world of professional dance as dancers uphold images of strength and a \"the show must go on\" mentality, despite pain and adversity. Through inventive visual collage and recent and archival footage, SNAP provides a backstage pass into Archie's path as a pioneer in this art form.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lo3EriCrmfhGq30jxcNMj5KFcHB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snap, Archie's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Snap - Archie's story","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3754630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Stamos","original_name":"George Stamos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63557118880c9200796df384","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.754,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lo3EriCrmfhGq30jxcNMj5KFcHB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":603}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
