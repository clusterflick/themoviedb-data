The investigation reveals the life story of what seems at first glance to be an ordinary Soviet family. While still young, the couple lost their long-desired infant daughter. Later in life, the fate gives them a child, but he happens to be a boy. The mother's pathological desire to have a daughter becomes an obsession. The woman treats Sashenka as a girl, dresses him as a girl and buys him dolls. The father supports his wife in every way. This is how starts a dramatic and astonishing story of human vices and deviations.","popularity":0.1646,"poster_path":"/y38yliNSw0U9tpJbF4Wdq3kJeUK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124996,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemastudio","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sashenka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3754475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitry Nizhelsky","original_name":"Dmitry Nizhelsky","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sashenka","credit_id":"63555d90f3b49a007a8511d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3147620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oksana Burlay-Piterova","original_name":"Oksana Burlay-Piterova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sasha's mom","credit_id":"63555d9cc9dbf9007affaffe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milena Kompaniiets","original_name":"Milena Kompaniiets","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lena","credit_id":"63555db056b9f7007e2f530f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3754481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmytro Orlov","original_name":"Дмитро Орлов","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/op11i7jrigK852ezvzznH0MnddS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kolya","credit_id":"63555ddb43250f008259c7ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Rybchinskiy","original_name":"Виктор Рыбчинский","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/14YgPa6LEObcWyPmn4vOofFpRV6.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Sasha's dad","credit_id":"65577b407f054018d2476ce6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2451883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Zhovna","original_name":"Oleksandr Zhovna","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/sQQGLcoPD2lMYaRRjqkOuL8Pz5u.jpg","credit_id":"638024b0d6d64d00cad79751","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2451883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Zhovna","original_name":"Oleksandr Zhovna","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/sQQGLcoPD2lMYaRRjqkOuL8Pz5u.jpg","credit_id":"638024c8229ae21572a7ad9b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2451883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Zhovna","original_name":"Oleksandr Zhovna","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/sQQGLcoPD2lMYaRRjqkOuL8Pz5u.jpg","credit_id":"638024ce6e938a00a0eb5dc9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3801604,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Evgeny Sivkov","original_name":"Evgeny Sivkov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638024db514c4a00d2e34e7f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2412350,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergey Kolbinev","original_name":"Сергей Колбинев","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638024e485b105008f4eea22","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19358770","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cjpkxh6ZU0HqnoHFFIXGynbgM2J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y38yliNSw0U9tpJbF4Wdq3kJeUK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fiK5uqaXB3W9jixwjWuLdryiHQB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival","release_date":"2022-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeonju International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Odesa International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
