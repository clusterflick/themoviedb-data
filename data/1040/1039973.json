His wife, who is living with him falls in love with another man (Mr.Nowak)(who in reality are three children in a trenchcoat), threatening the relationship. Her Husband becomes increasingly insane as nobody else is noticing the obvious fact, that it’s three children in disguise.  We follow the relationship of Mr.Nowak, who becomes an alcoholic, and the woman and her sexual frustration with her new „man“.  It ends with a death, with a human-annihilation-machine, a philosophical look into Hölderlins poems, and the realisation, that being an adult isn’t all that fun.","popularity":0.2007,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Three Children in a Trenchcoat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3757518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Gärtner","original_name":"Paul Gärtner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63581f32efd3c200907bd6fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10123,"name":"dark comedy"},{"id":3307,"name":"surreal"},{"id":286125,"name":"gritty"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
