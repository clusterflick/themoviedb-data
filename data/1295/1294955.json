For nearly 100 years the name Jos Divis was missing from histories of New Zealand photography. Now a wrong is being righted. Some call him the 'inventor of the selfie'. A street photographer ahead of his time he pioneered techniques to capture images of ordinary people and their working lives in a way no-one else could. Imprisoned for his beliefs, he lived his last years alone in the ghost town he helped bring to life, his family believing him dead. JOS is a journey of discovery following a historian, a photographer and a museum curator all working to give Jos Divis' the recognition he deserves.","popularity":0.0664,"poster_path":"/z6kq3mustAAMTgsowmHjOH1017v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","title":"Jos.
