Over 30 years later, the townâ€™s legacy remained, but now for a different community: transgender women. Trans Heaven, Pennsylvania explores the untold story of legendary, weekend-long parties that saw hundreds of transgender women and self-identified crossdressers take over the town, traveling from all over the country to meet other people like them. Through both interviews and stunning animation sequences that utilize never-before-seen archival photography, audiences not only get a glimpse into the heyday of these events in the early 2010s but also the iconic gay bar The Raven which became the unlikely cornerstone of these weekends.","popularity":0.2719,"poster_path":"/eykyeWvViJ9nI7tzn7jZnG6FvZq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trans Heaven, Pennsylvania","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2122430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hansen Bursic","original_name":"Hansen Bursic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664ea64349a2bfd7259311a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726831,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sowjanya Kudva","original_name":"Sowjanya Kudva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d07617d68163f452a0bedb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4044696,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Samantha K.
