Through the use of a rigorous linear structure and a careful work on the sound, the video activates in the viewer an imaginative process able to reanimate each single image into a new, possible narration: the gaze is intended as a responsible act, as a powerful tool able to carve the real and to unfold its deepest dimension.","popularity":0.0523,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Storie di fantasmi per adulti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Marcon","original_name":"Diego Marcon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664e73dbf57c23a361061cf3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
