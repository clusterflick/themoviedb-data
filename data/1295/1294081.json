After a gruesome conflict, leading to his death, the surviving Nazi leaders were hunted down all over Germany. These men were some of the most barbaric and evil men who stood alongside Hitler and helped make all of his atrocities possible. Even with the dedication of many Allied forces to capture Nazis, many of Hitler's men escaped Germany. As the Third Reich crumbled to pieces, thousands of Nazi officers and high-ranking party members fleed the continent and began searching for safety across the Atlantic. While some evaded arrest, many were brought to justice for their crimes against humanity. This is the story of the Most Wanted Nazis. \"","popularity":0.2609,"poster_path":"/kU8RuAFNuUxT4AR3Ovu5BNBMEt4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entertain Me Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Most Wanted Nazis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4228283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ploss","original_name":"David Ploss","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"664e16b29bfe96b35590d933","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4038195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Behar","original_name":"Eva Behar","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664e16c4ed762423cf429296","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4038200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Dagan","original_name":"Gabriel Dagan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664e16d4a482f10d04fd1a7e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4729526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Eger","original_name":"Edith Eger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664e16e9ed26e32ff7349f29","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4038177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manfred Goldberg","original_name":"Manfred Goldberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664e16f896d78c28e9b0e2fd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Mozes Kor","original_name":"Eva Mozes Kor","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664e1709b1f60e1b5bb0e276","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3880370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Pine","original_name":"Lisa Pine","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664e171a1e57059561caaaba","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4729527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naty Talavera","original_name":"Naty Talavera","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664e173106c3fa17f6061515","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Walters","original_name":"Guy Walters","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/fUxQ9OWfvtFFCEvIE6vo0Xsxmci.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664e174868eb7282bb639528","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4729523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Poorabi Gaekwad","original_name":"Poorabi Gaekwad","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664e1660ff39eafbeacaaddf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4729523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Poorabi Gaekwad","original_name":"Poorabi Gaekwad","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664e165559b6841d789edaac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27916539","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vI48oV24DTcqGWwmqejWDSyHvo8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kU8RuAFNuUxT4AR3Ovu5BNBMEt4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
