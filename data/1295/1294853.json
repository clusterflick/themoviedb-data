All images and video clips made on local walks with an old secondhand point and shoot compact cameras, gaffa tape on the front and a failing LCD.  Having found this site the 26th and seeing a suitable call asking for local stuff to be in by the 30th. I got some better software as well and was determined to get to grips with its complications. That meant a couple of days 'burning the candle at both ends'.  I walked around our small town often kneeling on my hat to get odd angles with the P&S. Each time I returned I added more bits to the video. I used Cora Thwaites as the figure she's a DAZ3D figure created by Adam Thwaites in Scarborough. She's fairly good at Ballet poses and really enjoys trying right down to her individual finger joints","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Local Figurative","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4732145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"JMRead","original_name":"JMRead","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664fc6cfed4fe89304954a50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
