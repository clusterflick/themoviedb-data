Asmus dares to speak frankly on religion (wow!), sex (whoa!) and politics (holy cow!) even as the spectre of cancel culture looms over us all. Asmus also includes some prop comedy while daring to be irreverently funny in a humorless age. After watching this special you will feel like a newborn baby, stripped of your preconceptions and ready to live again.","popularity":0.0652,"poster_path":"/gGAL8bsVktTaR88P4MIXl5X0Gqz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Geoffrey Asmus: The Prodigal Little Bitch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"杰弗里·阿斯慕斯：浪荡小贱人","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4259027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Asmus","original_name":"Geoffrey Asmus","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/1Qq95CFBjbGasUosTh3O7A1HCA9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"664e9fe42b7c699c7a9af68a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4259027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Asmus","original_name":"Geoffrey Asmus","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/1Qq95CFBjbGasUosTh3O7A1HCA9.jpg","credit_id":"664ea003ddcc9a3defdd257b","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1251916,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Leo","original_name":"Anthony Leo","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6678e18ce750a62ab2ee7639","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":915,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g2VNetIq6tZobogEX9dbZmX9OOE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":618},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":947,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gGAL8bsVktTaR88P4MIXl5X0Gqz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":631}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
