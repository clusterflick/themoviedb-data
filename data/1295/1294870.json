Man and environment are changing.  The inhabitants of a medium-sized city seek out an old abandoned area - here they are promised to be able to learn more about themselves - but each visitor has to pay an individual price.  A strange doorman welcomes the seekers and hands them each a key tailored to them.  The opening of the magical door finally heralds a journey.  The room as a mirror of themselves.  Confronted with your hidden longings and fears, the border to reality becomes increasingly blurred.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Door","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4732197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Chadwick","original_name":"Andrew Chadwick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"664fd43ca7cfca301bec1922","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4732199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Eckert","original_name":"Jo Eckert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"664fd443ddcc9a3defdd4c6f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4732201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Grosehe","original_name":"Erwin Grosehe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"664fd44ea7cfca301bec192e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4732202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niclas G.
