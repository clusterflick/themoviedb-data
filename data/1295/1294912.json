They spent the next twenty-five years operating and expanding their pottery school, raising a family and running a studio. A mining company, motivated by high gold prices, began a large open pit gold mining operation just outside of town in 1989. Nevada, encouraging mining, writes its laws to favor that industry's interests over all others. The pit grew ever larger, and the town found its very existence threatened. Spurning buyout offers from the mining company, the Parkses and the other residents decided to stay and fight the near-certain destruction of Tuscarora. As the video chronicles the ongoing saga, we learn much about the Parkses, their school, Dennis' clay work and life in the wide open west.","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":"/iquYx8CO9YckP6VbP1uIxGFBjyK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tuscarora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Schickele","original_name":"David Schickele","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664ff33cb26f59fd7d18df81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4470378","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iquYx8CO9YckP6VbP1uIxGFBjyK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
