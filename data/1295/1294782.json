Spijtmoeders is a documentary film about mothers who, if they could make the choice again, would rather not be mothers. Three women talk about their struggles with motherhood, the shame and guilt they feel, and the high expectations society places on them. The fear of judgment from others is great: what if people think that they are not a good mother, that they do not take good care of their child? What if they think they don't love their child? The mothers are represented by hyper-realistic dolls, but their voices are real.","popularity":0.3023,"poster_path":"/aBx5M9tMWL86WX69bcZvcv57jsl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239,"logo_path":"/96hCWEsfmTZQsoUap0CcG21qaA.png","name":"VPRO","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":109699,"logo_path":"/2GqnqHKf5ZXgAsyIJK9qZ6bQbSC.png","name":"Stepping
