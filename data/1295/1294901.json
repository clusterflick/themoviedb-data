Moving and still images are used in a painterly style; music, motion, colour, inner and outer nature connect and blur our senses. This visual album is both a personal and ecological journey full of natural distortions, painting, mind-blinking, breathing, dreams and hallucinations. BLOOMS is composed of seven vignettes: I) Opening: Welcome to my primordial soup. II) Many Shades / Algae Bloom: Starting to dream on a moonlit night. Descent. III) Nocturnal Mycophagy: Brain spaces. The forest comes alive at night. IV) Photosynthesis / Bird Flight: WARNING: This video may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy: Eyeball tickling, ambiance, and assault. V) Eutrophication: Disentangling dance in flowing crystals. VI) Pigeon Scrawls / Hypoxia: Trapped in a proliferating thicket of writing. VII) Sink: Rainbows in hand and erasure.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vividness Blooms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4732345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Gillis","original_name":"Laura Gillis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664fe46d1e57059561cb0659","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4732346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"powerSound","original_name":"powerSound","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664fe48114ac332553ec336b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4732345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Gillis","original_name":"Laura Gillis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664fe48d6615e132b334fd53","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4732348,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Phil Marvy","original_name":"Phil Marvy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664fe4992b7c699c7a9b2f00","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4732350,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michelangelo Iaffaldano","original_name":"Michelangelo Iaffaldano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664fe4a2ed26e32ff734f589","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4732351,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Seth Power","original_name":"Seth Power","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664fe4b07d97c9231a9b1e19","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
