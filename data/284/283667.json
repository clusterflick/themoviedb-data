In a city, she works in railway stations,as a waitress or even as a chimney sweep. At the factory, she only interrupts her work to feed her baby. At the country she does the plowing or picks olives. But above all a wife, she brings the soldier \"fraternity and tenderness\", parcels, love notes and care. She brings flowers to the dead's tombs, and remains ever present in the soldier's heart.","popularity":0.1081,"poster_path":"/hHRWvuJXmyJOXLV06ELBJd42an7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88895,"logo_path":null,"name":"Service Cinématographique de l'Armée","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1918-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La femme française pendant la guerre","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":544952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Bianchetti","original_name":"Suzanne Bianchetti","popularity":0.1718,"profile_path":"/l4xERZd9u46lyo2luijv554LOoL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53d2355cc3a368776700b89b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferdinand Foch","original_name":"Ferdinand Foch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xCwOY7GTkwIrk0bb6JkfVITC6Dt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"53d23564c3a368777a00b18a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346172,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandre Devarennes","original_name":"Alexandre Devarennes","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53d23537c3a368776400b799","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346172,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandre Devarennes","original_name":"Alexandre Devarennes","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f07eac92514125b100c4e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2939928","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hHRWvuJXmyJOXLV06ELBJd42an7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1918-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
