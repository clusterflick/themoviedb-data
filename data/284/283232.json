This established affinities between each of the image sections to the others, and the sound sections to each other. The image sections are: surveyors measuring the land near my house as seen through an old window, a family of Siamang Gibbon apes in the Washington zoo, an industrial site, and a page turned from a book on Cézanne’s composition showing a diagram of his painting Mardi Gras, filmed against bright leaves. The sound sections are: a dramatic scene from Debussy’s opera “Pelléas et Mélisande”, a passage from William Wordworth’s autobiographical poem “The Prelude,” sounds from rowing on a lake at night, and the sounds of the apes vocalizing.","popularity":0.1781,"poster_path":"/hVhNaNW85zVOmoIBGlnp27a0w0x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Elective Affinities III","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahiko Iimura","original_name":"飯村隆彦","popularity":0.1918,"profile_path":"/yOQilAdmhPQbSz6hUBDQr1E9dMO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60ef65835aba32002c419244","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6665119de5d3cf4f4bb56dfd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046110,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Kubelka","original_name":"Peter Kubelka","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/8p1CLqCFL40z8vnyTH8YZ8L346H.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"666511b2e4931860e84dc3a1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Wyborny","original_name":"Klaus Wyborny","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/wQRb6cnUErO4HuYmXsMFAmUglK6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"666511b98db38831ac13728f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Emigholz","original_name":"Heinz Emigholz","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":"/lHMPlkrIiRGV5j1uQyTEON0lhVl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"666511c3a4e6d85ae3157de1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Gottheim","original_name":"Larry Gottheim","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/y6YJWdMk6006kMVK1CwZXWtD713.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"666511c916450ea38082669b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Gottheim","original_name":"Larry Gottheim","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/y6YJWdMk6006kMVK1CwZXWtD713.jpg","credit_id":"53ce90d30e0a265dea0066e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7621512","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hVhNaNW85zVOmoIBGlnp27a0w0x.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7DhrFoBc5e1h4hpVXJO2qRK3y8q.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":848},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mYkZ01YtanoqKbxyr9c6WgSdLfL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eO5vh0KlTLPXOSzoIylMDZshb07.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iFtXJN0fui8BxheuAXPQ5fk31Lr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Whitney Museum of American Art","release_date":"1978-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
