For within her she carries the hope for all existence, and as an ancient prophecy from beyond this world begins to unfold, her own hidden destiny is revealed. But as a growing evil begins to take shape, the tides are shifted against those that would see the prophecy fulfilled, and a war started 1000 years before begins again here on Earth.\r - Written by Nathan Hall","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The end has come.","title":"The Vessel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1347203","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
