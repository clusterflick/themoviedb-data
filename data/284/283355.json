Japanese filmmakers entered the two cities intent on making an appeal to the International Red Cross, but were promptly arrested by newly arriving American troops. The Americans and Japanese eventually worked together to produce this film, a science film unemotionally displaying the effects of atomic particles, blast and fire on everything from concrete to human flesh. No other filmmakers were allowed into the cities, and when the film was done the Americans crated everything up and shipped it to an unknown location. That footage is now lost. However, an American and a Japanese filmmaker each stole and hid a copy of the film, fearful that the reality of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would be hidden from history. Eventually, these prints surfaced and became our only precious archive of the aftermath of nuclear warfare -- a film that everyone knows in part, yet has rarely seen in its entirety.","popularity":2.3612,"poster_path":"/oWZALhIHuIY46bi4kUb2APJSJ4X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157290,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nihon Eigasha","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Effects of the Atomic Bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"広島・長崎における原子爆弾の影響","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629403,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hideji Aihara","original_name":"Hideji Aihara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574f0a0bc3a3680c2300012f","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598634,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chozo Obata","original_name":"Chozo Obata","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574f0a20c3a3680c27000143","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dairokuro Okuyama","original_name":"Dairokuro Okuyama","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574f0a5fc3a3680c18000164","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1591539,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Akira Iwasaki","original_name":"Akira Iwasaki","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/wpCt1vCv0A5ZwhPaxZuvDwz6yOY.jpg","credit_id":"574f09eec3a3680c2700013e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629402,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ryuichi Kano","original_name":"Ryuichi Kano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574f0a02925141410f00011b","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masao Yamanaka","original_name":"Masao Yamanaka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574f0a67c3a3680c2300013d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sueo Ito","original_name":"Sueo Ito","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574f0a179251414109000141","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2093254","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1C9QXqmWEkrEsscMQBaRluFsmRz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oWZALhIHuIY46bi4kUb2APJSJ4X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1815,"name":"atomic bomb"},{"id":7460,"name":"hiroshima, japan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
