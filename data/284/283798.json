The lives of an inquisitive Waitress and wounded man clutching a smoking .45 in one hand as he protects a blood soaked bag of cash in the other.  They are two lonely souls who seem to know just what the other needs are forever changed when their paths cross at The Kozy Cafe.  Alexandra Smothers plays a healing angel who takes in the foreboding stranger, played by Dalin Christiansen.  Joe Osborn's innovative directing style and cinematography ignites their fiery passion.","popularity":0.0596,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"...words never describe two strangers' passion","title":"Silent Crossroads","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dalin Christiansen","original_name":"Dalin Christiansen","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Wounded Stranger","credit_id":"53d35e58c3a3686b8e000c2f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1345348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Smothers","original_name":"Alexandra Smothers","popularity":0.1336,"profile_path":"/Ac8QiqwwURXvF8eu8YEKuKMfsGZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Margie the witress","credit_id":"53d35e7dc3a3686b88000dae","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
