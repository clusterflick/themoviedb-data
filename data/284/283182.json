The film focuses on Eknath's humanitarian defence of the 'untouchable' castes. Opposed by the evil Mahant (Kelkar/Chandramohan), Eknath becomes a social outcast when he arranges to have the lower-caste people fed before the Brahmins during a prayer meeting at his house, compounding the offence by going to eat in one of their houses. The drama is heightened by Eknath's son Hari Pandit (Kale) who joins the ranks of the opposition. The happy ending occurs when the film transcends the food motif and Eknath defends himself by reading his poems to the Pradayananda Shastri of Kashi.","popularity":0.1154,"poster_path":"/uanT2G70QkAydVx3n7pXSXrmiM4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1935-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dharmatma","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1344877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bal Gandharva","original_name":"Bal Gandharva","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53ce3998c3a36877670045e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1344878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ratnaprabha","original_name":"Ratnaprabha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53ce39a0c3a36877670045e6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"K.
