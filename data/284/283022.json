Commissioned to mark the arrival of the 2014 Tour de France in Yorkshire, the film makes full use of stunning British Film Institute footage to transport the audience on a journey from the invention of the modern bike, through the rise of recreational cycling, to gruelling competitive races. Award-winning director Daisy Asquith artfully combines the richly-diverse archive with a hypnotic soundtrack from cult composer Bill Nelson in a joyful, absorbing watch for both cycling and archive fans.","popularity":0.273,"poster_path":"/ew7e27hv0SXUhAiwV4VmkunmpON.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Velorama","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1344495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daisy Asquith","original_name":"Daisy Asquith","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/zzXQRX4038yD2UzHJPr3otWY8ek.jpg","credit_id":"53ccf343c3a368776d0027c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1344497,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Atkin","original_name":"Mark Atkin","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ccf35ec3a368777a00262f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1344498,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heather Croall","original_name":"Heather Croall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ccf368c3a368776d0027ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3853804","wikidata_id":"Q17507214","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ew7e27hv0SXUhAiwV4VmkunmpON.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2059,"name":"cycle"},{"id":3797,"name":"bicycle"},{"id":18185,"name":"bike"},{"id":180491,"name":"cycling"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":199239,"name":"storyville"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
