The film is mood-filled: A duel scene in a snowy forest, obviously the morning after a masquerade ball. Harlequin lies dying, while Red Indian walks away with the wings of victory. The woman between them appears, cat-masked. The mask dissolves away. Her spirit passes into the face of the sun upon the sun upon the sun flower. But Harlequin cannot escape death. The blue world engulfs him.","popularity":0.4103,"poster_path":"/q8Y3N2Upd4e2KRbWpnNilSI1SK8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Masquerade","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":267634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Jordan","original_name":"Lawrence Jordan","popularity":0.2613,"profile_path":"/nELFCK1hpF0pmhRSQy9EdWrVG6R.jpg","credit_id":"53d46a820e0a26284400316f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2364767","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q8Y3N2Upd4e2KRbWpnNilSI1SK8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/21MZP5txmO5ypVGoFrc3yKPHZwv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"},{"id":7507,"name":"collage"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
