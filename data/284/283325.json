The little girl, whose home is at the seaside, goes out on the rocks to play with her dog. There she romps with her pet and quite loses sight of the constantly rising tide. Suddenly she discovers that the rocks are surrounded, and her escape entirely cut off. Turning to her dog, she motions him to the land; instantly he is off, swimming to shore and dashing across the beach. He reaches the stable, where he unties the pet horse, then leading the way, he and the horse dash off to the surf, through which they plunge. The horse soon reaches the rock, which he has much difficulty in approaching, but finally the little girl succeeds in getting upon his back, and is then swiftly borne to shore.","popularity":0.0957,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hepworth","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1907-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dumb Sagacity","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertie Potter","original_name":"Gertie Potter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53cf9290c3a36877670074f6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1008306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lewin Fitzhamon","original_name":"Lewin Fitzhamon","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/xoX2TycUhzArQ8tmqqXiBBL8hBH.jpg","credit_id":"53cf9286c3a368777a007070","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2007375","wikidata_id":"Q15866834","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1907-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
