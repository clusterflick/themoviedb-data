The film is based on Anatol Stern's 1925 futurist poem Europa. It uses collages and photograms, and articulates the sense of horror and moral decline its makers were witnessing. The film, while long thought to have been lost, is considered an avant-garde masterpiece.","popularity":0.0741,"poster_path":"/1A61od4ulBsoJKasp2wFiuxZOxy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1932-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Europa","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franciszka Themerson","original_name":"Franciszka Themerson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"61a8a0ee875d1a008b58fe39","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Themerson","original_name":"Stefan Themerson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53d0ed85c3a368777500a06e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139714,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anatol Stern","original_name":"Anatol Stern","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a8a0d1c5c1ef0045fe3da8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franciszka Themerson","original_name":"Franciszka Themerson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56309148925141616700179a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5178274","wikidata_id":"Q108643579","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1700,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1A61od4ulBsoJKasp2wFiuxZOxy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1134}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1932-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
