She sought help at a temple, but the problem was not solved. Instead, many devotees gather to ask her questions about their deceased loved ones and even winning lottery numbers. Her work as a psychic leaves her with no time to practice baseball. What she really cares about is whether a guy in her school’s baseball team likes her. The boy she has a crush on invites Junya to his birthday party. However, there is a long line of people waiting at the temple for her advice. How will she choose between love and her sacred mission?","popularity":0.2214,"poster_path":"/qzWnSq1K8kiy1vTGMf99HpMTet1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2013-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A young psychic who can see spirits decides to stand up and fight against the temple culture when she is faced with a choice between fulfilling the responsibility placed by superstitious adults and living up her teenage life.","title":"The Busy Young Psychic","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La jeune prétresse","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"THE BUSY YOUNG PSYCHIC","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1344776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pei-Jen Yu","original_name":"余佩真","popularity":0.1918,"profile_path":"/fHRpYFqTTuV25KHxwHR7usgSFd8.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Xie Junya","credit_id":"53cdded4c3a368777a003bda","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2407367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hung-Hsiu Wu","original_name":"Hung-Hsiu Wu","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/99ldOdALYCnfcYulKZ3D1RIBQeL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f958adc595a5600321bc7ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3147364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ying-Hung Lee","original_name":"Ying-Hung Lee","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/5Xb9GpT3J6DgF4i0VmHTe9edHb9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60e3be9227ff990074dd65ec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1756785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shih Chao Wang","original_name":"Shih Chao Wang","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/y9bvXhkC1ROrrgh7zK9Ho3THbqU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Younger brother","credit_id":"6317f12c0f0da5009b46ea3d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1344777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ho-Yu Chen","original_name":"Ho-Yu Chen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/uN5XWp7VvrqxavAIqmY36ofPeQw.jpg","credit_id":"53cddee6c3a368776d003dd2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2381375,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ming-Sheng Kao","original_name":"Ming-Sheng Kao","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6317f17f8d77c4007bca60b1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1518770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tan Seng Kiat","original_name":"Tan Seng Kiat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6317f1ae8d77c40080b741fe","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2023024,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chen Ko-chin","original_name":"Chen Ko-chin","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":"/tUxT4IkvI3P9a7M5Pkdbv2LftIr.jpg","credit_id":"667a7ac8a50baf510015945e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1344777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ho-Yu Chen","original_name":"Ho-Yu Chen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/uN5XWp7VvrqxavAIqmY36ofPeQw.jpg","credit_id":"5f958aee6611b40032bb1dbb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3120828","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"130397613805889","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/avLVpOb8JeBBSLSiRG8HLl3z9Is.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":848,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/qzWnSq1K8kiy1vTGMf99HpMTet1.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/nHVWsDhfyTbaj6SvT2eJegU5i54.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14742,"name":"psychic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"2014台北電影節｜神算 The Busy Young Psychic","key":"DXxAi-I3veI","published_at":"2014-06-03T09:50:57.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"59ddcd4b925141251f08923b"}]}}}
