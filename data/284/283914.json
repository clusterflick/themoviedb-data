The classics, for the one you love UFO today but all were already published that have not yet reached a little more focused on more pop songs phase of the early eighties, and then Englishman present in this WDR Rockpalast recording in very good shape and as a bone-dry , no-frills hard rock band, impressed their game and songwriting even 30 years later.  Especially the hits \"Lights out\", \"rock bottom\" and \"Doctor, Doctor\" ensure goosebumps. Sound and image (of course 4:3) in public service TV quality guarantee best entertainment, and only the lean Ausstatttung is somewhat disappointing: Were there no interviews, no backstage footage? An excellent live document of an exceptional band.","popularity":0.0543,"poster_path":"/hAW2RY4YWeytj9bGk8huUzdPPH8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"UFO: Rockpalast 1980","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"UFO - Westfalenhalle, Dortmund 1980","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2204033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Mogg","original_name":"Phil Mogg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kkcuP26HQi7O84KjdCs2bqLpyea.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"6129dd3c2c6b7b00626e2e5e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3214791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Chapman","original_name":"Paul Chapman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/rTYofcjSHauO2TOEp5zrZRRJWKi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Guitars","credit_id":"6129dd62a1d3320067f56686","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Way","original_name":"Pete Way","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/qfkkjk9ZHaHrJLnBCAxqZUjPTYy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"6129dd725ed9620092eae3f9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Parker","original_name":"Andy Parker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/tjoxLYB3XZBAx71L827CHINebcy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"6129dd84f8e982002cf63549","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Carter","original_name":"Neil Carter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/drKKm6GHgOlG31S8FwXMiowhW40.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Keyboards, Guitars","credit_id":"6129dd9a2c6b7b002ccccffe","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hAW2RY4YWeytj9bGk8huUzdPPH8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
