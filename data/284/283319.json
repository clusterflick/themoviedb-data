Jarman's contribution is a version of his 1977 Art and the Pose (aka Arty the Pose), refilmed at 3fps, with a musical soundtrack. Jarman planned The Dream Machine as a commemoration of William Burroughs and Gysin's 1982 visit to the UK, and received initial funding from the Arts Council in 1983, then rethought the project as a portmanteau film featuring Gysin alone. The production remained in limbo until 1986, when James Mackay obtained completion funding from the British Film Institute.  (Since this film was released on VHS accompanied by Jarman's Broken English: Three Songs by Marianne Faithfull, T.G.: Psychic Rally in Heaven and Pirate Tape under the umbrella title The Dream Machine, synopses of this film have often muddled up its details with those of the earlier films. )","popularity":0.232,"poster_path":"/l1FT6FECGtr1BnKrCzLp6ZB4LcL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of England","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dream Machine","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brion Gysin","original_name":"Brion Gysin","popularity":0.1625,"profile_path":"/4eKK9AuOo6Eqs54d9vS53K4nkg4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5673ff14c3a3685edc001d95","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Incandela","original_name":"Gerald Incandela","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5673ff1c9251412dab002051","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2350533,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Marc Prouveur","original_name":"Jean-Marc Prouveur","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f83363248333a00389bd73b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1605817,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Mackay","original_name":"James Mackay","popularity":0.0848,"profile_path":"/nLE7UEttR9cYinJqda8S1o7M9lL.jpg","credit_id":"62d6d656048638004bcbe3e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Maybury","original_name":"John Maybury","popularity":0.1563,"profile_path":"/uo2dyM33NQ6GNhXz8sMDx0pLSs3.jpg","credit_id":"53cf8b9cc3a36877640072e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Kostiff","original_name":"Michael Kostiff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5673ff43c3a3685eee001f79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86290,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek Jarman","original_name":"Derek Jarman","popularity":0.2281,"profile_path":"/vozzl6a3kqNJhWo7AheLMp81xVn.jpg","credit_id":"5673ff3cc3a3685ef1001d7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cerith Wyn Evans","original_name":"Cerith Wyn Evans","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5673ff51c3a3685edc001d9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351142,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tim Burke","original_name":"Tim Burke","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5673ff729251412db4002123","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0085459","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l1FT6FECGtr1BnKrCzLp6ZB4LcL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":221413,"name":"dreamachine"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
