Director Joel Lesko interviews modern Buddhistic teachers to find out how their teachings apply in daily life - are emotions an impediment to spiritual growth? What about so-called unspiritual emotions like anger and hate? Do emotions trap a seeker in the personal self? Tears is a serious look at an area of life that is often confusing and problematic for people in spiritual practices. Rather than another documentary about a teacher's enlightenment or awakening, Tears of the Buddha questions age-old teachings about emotions and leads to an important conversation about individual selfhood - is it real, or is it an illusion? Lesko shares his own experiences and interviews leading teachers including Gangaji, Eli-Jaxon-Bear, Jeff Foster, and others.","popularity":0.3504,"poster_path":"/liCiEAEQXbJXiaPFVltGSXPJeTq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tears of the Buddha: Spirituality and Emotions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Lesko","original_name":"Joel Lesko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1a9e7a410c811f9dfe9f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890891,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Goldblatt","original_name":"David Goldblatt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1aa57cb71b800d439d956","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Lesko","original_name":"Joel Lesko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1a9fecb71b80085dd5cc2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2523432","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/liCiEAEQXbJXiaPFVltGSXPJeTq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":188,"name":"buddhism"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":10706,"name":"spirituality"},{"id":211269,"name":"emotions"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":311871,"name":"spiritual growth"},{"id":311872,"name":"selfhood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
