Punctuated by quotes from the composer and interpretations of his works, this documentary sets out in search of a treasure of many nuances, which continues to liven up village festivals and influence the young Romanian scene. From the scores of Dan Dediu, one of today's greatest composers, to the folk songs of the Maramures, a journey to discover this fascinating mosaic of musical cultures.","popularity":0.0618,"poster_path":"/fwMKogTpq58FteUc2flRbQQMHa0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un voyage sonore en Roumanie : A travers les temps et les mondes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1083816,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Günter Atteln","original_name":"Günter Atteln","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cfe9201b157d0082ddf0ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/e6qP1RNO2ZZNup1Zla2Ot94D2Eo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fwMKogTpq58FteUc2flRbQQMHa0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
