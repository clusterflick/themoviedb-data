What is at stake in these entry-point and final-year classes? In the four years spent there, the youngsters enter their teenage years, begin to perceive their place in society and have to think about their future. From December to June, this chronicle follows the maths teachers, Anne-Sophie, Fabienne and Richard, who are also the class teachers for the first and final year pupils. We discover all the out-of-class meetings and paperwork, as well as the end-of-year committees that decide what kind of education the youngsters will go on to do. In a far from easy situation, the teachers are forced to rethink their educational role, which is not limited to transmitting knowledge.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24033,"logo_path":"/dZ7shHqHbMAD05hQPzYgz5OAKwl.png","name":"France 5","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grandir au collège","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Van In","original_name":"André Van In","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cfefd691745b00b519e19f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888886,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guillaume Mollet","original_name":"Guillaume Mollet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cff01b0d2f5301fdf9eee4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2017758,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Françoise Besnier","original_name":"Françoise Besnier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648359d999259c011c3f9f01","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
