Erik Bergqvist is a young documentary filmmaker who is eager to tell the truth and create a martyr and a symbol out of his subject. The film is a satirical look at the documentary genre and how a narrative perspective and subjects can be used and misinterpreted for a larger goal. It´s a callback to the old swedish docudramas Stockholmsnatt and They Call Us Misfits about troubled teenage men in Stockholm.","popularity":0.0725,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dokument: Blixten","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3664866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lukas Sjögren","original_name":"Lukas Sjögren","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/uTrNEvIrriBC3pX8bJvL5zpbQBV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lukas \"Blixten\" Skenström","credit_id":"63cfd96eb6cff100aa082013","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edvin Bergström","original_name":"Edvin Bergström","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Erik Bergqvist","credit_id":"63cfd9821b157d00a2dd8eaf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexi Matthis","original_name":"Alexi Matthis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Matte","credit_id":"63cfd9908dbc33009d7a72f6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lovisa Dahne","original_name":"Lovisa Dahne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bruden","credit_id":"63cfd99db6cff100b936378b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Björklund","original_name":"Viktor Björklund","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Burken","credit_id":"63cfd9ad1b157d008a3435da","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3888745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Eriksdottir","original_name":"Louise Eriksdottir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Louie","credit_id":"63cfd9bcb6cff100e91fd240","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Calle Svensson","original_name":"Calle Svensson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Calle med Kniven","credit_id":"63cfd9cc1b157d0082dde9bc","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edvin Bergström","original_name":"Edvin Bergström","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cfd9ec1b157d008a3435f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3664866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lukas Sjögren","original_name":"Lukas Sjögren","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/uTrNEvIrriBC3pX8bJvL5zpbQBV.jpg","credit_id":"63cfd9fab6cff1008eed54fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edvin Bergström","original_name":"Edvin Bergström","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cfda07cf9ba3009c49e264","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexi Matthis","original_name":"Alexi Matthis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cfda278dbc330086feea73","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lovisa Dahne","original_name":"Lovisa Dahne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cfda35cf9ba300843256f9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3664866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lukas Sjögren","original_name":"Lukas Sjögren","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/uTrNEvIrriBC3pX8bJvL5zpbQBV.jpg","credit_id":"63cfda150d2f5301d1efe6c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888750,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leon Johansson","original_name":"Leon Johansson","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cfda430d2f53025753c879","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qecd8wLw8PgyxZ6B5z6o41u9GWr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
