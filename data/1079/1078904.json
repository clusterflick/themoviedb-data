The film follows two teenage boxers from the forgotten suburbs of Buenos Aires on their way to their debut bout. It will be decided in the ring whether they can continue to hope that one day they will leave the lack of prospects in their neighborhood behind in order to \"be someone\". Youthful enthusiasm meets harsh reality when some of her colleagues form a boxing union.","popularity":0.4061,"poster_path":"/4eEDnVVNFmN5kbGb7VoQ8XR0q5r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143859,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Caminante Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2012-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Will you ever be somebody?","title":"Boxeo Constitución","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3891575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Federico Rodriguez","original_name":"Federico Rodriguez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d290a29f51af007af8c0f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3891576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Angel Dewey","original_name":"Miguel Angel Dewey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d290be66ae4d0096b70ce6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3891577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariel Abalos","original_name":"Ariel Abalos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d290d666ae4d009e9ec631","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3891579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariel Abalos","original_name":"Ariel Abalos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d290de66ae4d008428027b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3891580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Menno","original_name":"José Menno","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d290eca410c811f192f8f7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3891581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Peral de Trotsky","original_name":"Miriam Peral de Trotsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"63d2911b5a07f50082f3845b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3891582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ignacio Artime","original_name":"Ignacio Artime","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d29128a410c812385d38fc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3891583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonny Sosa","original_name":"Jonny Sosa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d2914366ae4d0096b70d19","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3891587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jakob Weingartner","original_name":"Jakob Weingartner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2919ccb71b800896cb611","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3891588,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrés Riva","original_name":"Andrés Riva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d291b066ae4d00842802bc","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3891590,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Antonio Schade","original_name":"Antonio Schade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d291dacb71b80085ddcf90","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3891587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jakob Weingartner","original_name":"Jakob Weingartner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d29206cb71b800896cb640","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3891604,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"El Remolón","original_name":"El Remolón","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d29291e72fe800e9e67cbc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11249,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bernd Euscher","original_name":"Bernd Euscher","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669fd35561d93289c7189908","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2323481","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/4eEDnVVNFmN5kbGb7VoQ8XR0q5r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":524}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5402,"name":"boxing school"},{"id":156330,"name":"boxing trainer"},{"id":311939,"name":"boxeo argentino"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
