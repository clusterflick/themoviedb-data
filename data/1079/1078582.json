But she cant sing.  When Joy takes in a stray dog, Raffi, her life immediately changes. Her best friend, the tarot card reading Tessa (Janet Watson Kruse), moves in, Joy changes her name to Luna Starr, and she meets Peter Wolfman (Andrew Einspruch).  When Peter encourages her to perform with him at the local pizzerias folk music nights, Joy sings sort of hiding behind masks of wigs and silliness.  Despite the singing, Peter and Joys relationship blossoms. But there are lots of hiccups along the way -- ex-wives, ex-husbands, frightening performances, and bucket loads of doubt.  Set to the backdrop of the folk music scene in an arty country town, the film celebrates universal themes of friendship, low self-esteem, love relationships, and the joy of dogs.","popularity":0.8126,"poster_path":"/sfd4MwuH1DBonirbe1yGs1HqiSC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding
