Is he the ‘pure fool, enlightened by compassion’, who, it has been prophesied, will purify the realm?  OperaVision is live from Bergen for a concert staging of Parsifal, Richard Wagner’s final music drama which is unlike anything that went before or has come since. It can feel more like a ritual ceremony than an opera – grand yet intimate, somehow occupying its own space and time. At the heart of Parsifal is a curious, magical treatment of the symphony orchestra that appears to give the voices above it all the space and autonomy they need.","popularity":0.0943,"poster_path":"/xbbVmQdJxeAFuadrJ1PhiVcq6JZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parsifal - PBO","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Skelton","original_name":"Stuart Skelton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63d0ee029e45860079cdb263","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricarda Merbeth","original_name":"Ricarda Merbeth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63d0ee099e45860079cdb266","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Reuter","original_name":"Johan Reuter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63d0ee0f9f51af0086459cc7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brindley Sherratt","original_name":"Brindley Sherratt","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/tTie8tju3MepAbbiuaEIgpG6Kuu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63d0ee169e4586009d3813e5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olafur Sigurdarson","original_name":"Olafur Sigurdarson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63d0ee22e72fe80084909acb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reinhard Hagen","original_name":"Reinhard Hagen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63d0ee2ca410c811f9dfaa88","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567031,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edward Gardner","original_name":"Edward Gardner","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d0ee3a66ae4d009e9e1989","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890010,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolai Riise","original_name":"Nicolai Riise","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d0ee45a410c811f1924e18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xbbVmQdJxeAFuadrJ1PhiVcq6JZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
