Emerging filmmaker Danic Champoux poses the question \"How many men still have to uproot themselves and leave their families to get work?\" as he sets out to search for his own father. He wonders about these men who are labourers, itinerants, and mostly nameless, but who are all exemplary providers. But at what cost? This film was produced as part of the Libres Courts collection of first-time documentary shorts.","popularity":0.2135,"poster_path":"/qKMHIQY1XIKO4s2zy5di6nFaoE3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Father","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1979714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Gladu","original_name":"André Gladu","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d167d366ae4d007bf63959","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danic Champoux","original_name":"Danic Champoux","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/1Ho2dRYdLj4jL5RtMyvSRKFNTmi.jpg","credit_id":"63d167da9e45860085cd8db8","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danic Champoux","original_name":"Danic Champoux","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/1Ho2dRYdLj4jL5RtMyvSRKFNTmi.jpg","credit_id":"63d167ba9f51af008299f658","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qKMHIQY1XIKO4s2zy5di6nFaoE3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5905,"name":"father"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":33585,"name":"labor"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
