It follows the history of old music groups called tajfi, founded in Ohrid, Veles and Bitola as a result of influences of Turkish classical music, which in Macedonia was blended with Western European traditions. The movie uses old archival footage of the performances of the bards of this type of music, highlighting important aspects of Macedonian music traditions for future generations. In parallel with historical coverage, the film follows the creation and development of new music bands in Macedonia, representing the survival of this musical style in today’s context.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":"/6hl28g9HathcRlhqmNOgHYsQwWV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68218,"logo_path":null,"name":"Award Film & Video","origin_country":"MK"},{"id":66158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quasar Film","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2019-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keif (Macedonian Chalgia Tradition)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","title":"Македонска чалгиска традиција","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"KEIF","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"MK","title":"Kjeif","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538194,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Blaže Dulev","original_name":"Blaže Dulev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2c3a366ae4d00c1cf7df1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538193,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Goran Naumovski","original_name":"Goran Naumovski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2c3b9e72fe800849152a3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538194,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Blaže Dulev","original_name":"Blaže Dulev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2c37ae72fe800b2052653","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3879583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Risto Solunčev","original_name":"Risto Solunčev","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d319eee72fe800e9e6a741","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617852,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Darko Spasovski","original_name":"Darko Spasovski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d31a86cb71b800896ce61e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6hl28g9HathcRlhqmNOgHYsQwWV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":571}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
