For over seven years, military conflict, unseen and forgotten by many, has been raging here. But the Ghost Battalion held down the fort all this time. The film documents the life of the battalion for the past three years.  What do summer days and winter nights look like for the soldiers? How do they go about their daily routine of eating and sleeping? What does actual battle look like? These military personnel have spent over seven years in battles. What are they fighting for? These are the questions the soldiers are discussing in the independent documentary by Maksim Fadeev and Sergey Belous — what they feel, what their life is like and what they expect of the future.","popularity":0.1859,"poster_path":"/3oU1jH0ydREGHcnrIZoffudopbF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Living and fighting in the Donbass hot zone","title":"Ghosts: Soldiers of a Forgotten War","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1565981,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maxim Fadeev","original_name":"Максим Фадеев","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/mMgfSuPWcSULCGQ0OF0fTZ57hPY.jpg","credit_id":"63d114b3a410c811e9be38ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/tL1IZ3jqArlqoH5dDHLcxjioQSP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/dKjwWz0aleshE9fmXp0tIASXZja.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/jXNY8v3rZdvYSa5l0ESD7tvEJLw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3oU1jH0ydREGHcnrIZoffudopbF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":206541,"name":"seperatist"},{"id":312463,"name":"donestsk"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
