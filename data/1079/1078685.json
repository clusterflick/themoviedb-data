Together they have created an oasis where they can be themselves, a group of friends with a mishmash of backgrounds and sexualities where no one apologizes to anyone. Over the course of a day, they move from forest raves to house parties, mixing alcohol and drugs with reflections on love and existence, right up to the inevitable going home. Blomster offers a playful and associative close-up of a group of young people’s search for belonging, seasoned with humor, civilizational criticism, and sensual realism.","popularity":0.3461,"poster_path":"/fGsHjT7gi7RfmnbzvulPIhWn9Bi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Young love, thrill-seeking, and hallucinatory Swedish summer night in Neil Wigardt’s visually explosive debut.","title":"Synthetic Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali Sharif","original_name":"Ali Sharif","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63d1b501cb71b80085dd5fbf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Berg","original_name":"Agnes Berg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63d1b512cb71b8007c1b4a5f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amber Mastacci","original_name":"Amber Mastacci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63d1b53066ae4d00c1cf0a4c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liam Aguilar Castillo","original_name":"Liam Aguilar Castillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"63d1b5469f51af00b67cb5a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moa Boström","original_name":"Moa Boström","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"63d1b569a410c81215b632fe","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saint Toll Wood","original_name":"Saint Toll Wood","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"63d1b5765a07f500869073a9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santiago Martinez","original_name":"Santiago Martinez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"63d1b5909f51af00b67cb5b5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Savanna Hanneryd","original_name":"Savanna Hanneryd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"63d1b59e5a07f500869073bc","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2242833,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Neil Wigardt","original_name":"Neil Wigardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1b4789f51af00b67cb57b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2242833,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Neil Wigardt","original_name":"Neil Wigardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1b48acb71b800810234da","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2242833,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Neil Wigardt","original_name":"Neil Wigardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1b49c66ae4d008427963b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2242833,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Neil Wigardt","original_name":"Neil Wigardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1b4a7e72fe8008490dd00","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761694,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lia Hietala","original_name":"Lia Hietala","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1b4ba66ae4d0096b6a9f8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2306858,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Malin Hüber","original_name":"Malin Hüber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1b4d2cb71b800896c502e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27505039","wikidata_id":"Q119084930","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1462,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Vm5tOjARa5RUBxJUqFLwd4BHcf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fGsHjT7gi7RfmnbzvulPIhWn9Bi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
