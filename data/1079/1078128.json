Over the years, the Manaki brothers have been mythologized, and the addition of new and unconfirmed information in order to increase their importance is unnecessary and harmful, because their work is of great cultural importance not only in Macedonia, but also in the wider Balkan context.  For this reason, every fact and opinion presented in the movie MANAKI – A STORY IN PICTURES has been carefully researched and confirmed with presented artifacts. The story is told through original documentary photographs following their work from the opening of the first professional studio in 1898 in Ioannina and later moving to Bitola, now known as the town of the Manaki brothers.","popularity":0.1051,"poster_path":"/ueKN5dugzG9UZqaMe343ACB3e21.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":191772,"logo_path":null,"name":"MCF Filmska Produkcija","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2019-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manaki - A Story in Pictures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","title":"Manaki - Prikazna vo sliki","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798523,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robert Jankuloski","original_name":"Robert Jankuloski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d0016291745b00b519e95e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888941,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ilindenka Petrusheva","original_name":"Ilindenka Petrusheva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d0018ecf9ba300b1df5d62","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538194,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Blaže Dulev","original_name":"Blaže Dulev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d0019d1685da00c92369e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798523,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robert Jankuloski","original_name":"Robert Jankuloski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d001560d2f53022e460661","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1680253,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Goran Kerkez","original_name":"Goran Kerkez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d001c11685da008710888a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617852,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Darko Spasovski","original_name":"Darko Spasovski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d001b31b157d00863801e8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798523,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robert Jankuloski","original_name":"Robert Jankuloski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d001708dbc33008e773616","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1654,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ueKN5dugzG9UZqaMe343ACB3e21.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1181}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
