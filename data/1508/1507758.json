In the domestic environ of London, shafts of sunlight alternatively obscure and illuminate a simple still life view of a kitchen sideboard and shelves, caught in bursts of real time. Filmed over a day, the culinary tableau of plates, mugs and bowls disappear from the frame, piece by piece, in a playful tidying of the filmic space, which also recalls a child’s memory game, requiring us to remember what was once placed where. Berlin was also filmed within a kitchen interior, but rather than a fixed frame view Todd’s camera roves around the space, revealing the absent householder in an intimate focus on small details and simple kitchen objects.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/b7e55E01YmfkjuvyL2zmBsB0dW9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Films From The Room","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Todd","original_name":"Peter Todd","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686686be2370ef35f9da4484","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b7e55E01YmfkjuvyL2zmBsB0dW9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
