Enter Maurice — a raccoon puppet with a questionable past and a knack for unsolicited life coaching. His methods? Dubious. His timing? Impeccable. Together, they navigate alleyways, awkward truths, and the art of starting over. A trashy little tale about redemption, unexpected friendship the beauty of getting a second chance from the most unlikely places.  Sometimes the best advice comes from the bottom of a bin.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"A problem shared's a problem halved...
