So when she stumbles across a clue to the identity of the muse for one of rock’s greatest, she devotes herself to uncovering the truth, even as her own relationship is falling apart. While writing an article for Rolling Stone, Cecilia works to reveal the mystery that has intrigued fans and discovers a classic tale of two soulmates separated by fate and circumstance. Rockstar Eddie Vee once sang with his soul, dedicating love songs to Sara Friedman, his inspiration and first love. Now, Eddie takes refuge in anonymity, closed off to the past. Sara, too, has distanced herself from their love, moving thousands of miles away to live the life she once railed against. As Eddie and Sara tentatively open up to Cecilia about broken dreams, she struggles to give them a happy ending. In the process, she learns that broken hearts can be healed—even her own.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":"/xAhQJwWSjW3qyW257XhHC0tFoyI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":252702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Fishy","origin_country":""},{"id":107513,"logo_path":"/rkIrMsS6rmTjgs5wc2odqco0P5i.png","name":"Phiphen Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"What You Do to Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5540496,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rochelle Weinstein","original_name":"Rochelle Weinstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68658ff25aab7ae92d705496","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xAhQJwWSjW3qyW257XhHC0tFoyI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":4048,"name":"musician"},{"id":917,"name":"journalism"},{"id":244886,"name":"love story"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
