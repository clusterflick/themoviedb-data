Vivie Warren is a woman ahead of her time. Her mother, however, is a product of that old patriarchal order. Exploiting it has earned Mrs. Warren a fortune – but at what cost?  Filmed live from the West End, this new production reunites Staunton with director Dominic Cooke (Follies, Good ), exploring the clash between morality and independence, traditions and progress.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xh02VRO7Duh5LaU67cusKEcESTB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16355,"logo_path":"/tWuPpLrD2urqKPXIit4VLTHWvgK.png","name":"National Theatre","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Theatre Live : Mrs Warren's Profession","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imelda Staunton","original_name":"Imelda Staunton","popularity":1.632,"profile_path":"/tABRYOHUQeaUCAqrelJV5ZHjl1W.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mrs Peggy Warren","credit_id":"6865dbd31103bda4f27bf661","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1278548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bessie Carter","original_name":"Bessie Carter","popularity":0.6581,"profile_path":"/rMzm3hoFQIisFFXOhsDvHI2Ka9z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Vivie Warren","credit_id":"6865dc35ba5554df088f1add","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1216101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Doyle","original_name":"Kevin Doyle","popularity":0.6149,"profile_path":"/qAOTfour2vXXpQxlMK4sSKISb4F.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Reverend Samuel Gardner","credit_id":"6865dc76b7d2f00ea88f1abe","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Glenister","original_name":"Robert Glenister","popularity":0.7278,"profile_path":"/18oHwzcExUfXnDLyDWQEtmjPo1V.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sir George Crofts","credit_id":"6865dc8f295918d25231f830","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4642360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reuben Joseph","original_name":"Reuben Joseph","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Frank Gardner","credit_id":"6865dcae2c9b9367e031f7f7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5540925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Sigar","original_name":"Sid Sigar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Praed","credit_id":"6865dccae37aba088aac631c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1539858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominic Cooke","original_name":"Dominic Cooke","popularity":0.1903,"profile_path":"/iWAAi2vJd3zHZWckPY8Q5gp7TWM.jpg","credit_id":"6865dcddaed1b32568c115a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33085,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Bernard Shaw","original_name":"George Bernard Shaw","popularity":0.3376,"profile_path":"/fBFXY9ZUUToA5VUM8yXNqiOPw5O.jpg","credit_id":"6865dcfde12e92fd80da4264","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95911,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Chloe Lamford","original_name":"Chloe Lamford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/468ZWYwkK2hqrLc150o4Nloh6oO.jpg","credit_id":"6865dd3b1b098d0036da4273","department":"Art","job":"Decorator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5540927,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Jon Clark","original_name":"Jon Clark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6865dd5d6e32cf58548f1b71","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479314,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christopher Shutt","original_name":"Christopher Shutt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6865dd6e753b16619e9c2c98","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uGiMhHMEU9m5pdkfeQi9qnD6Cvr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xh02VRO7Duh5LaU67cusKEcESTB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":195729,"name":"stage play"},{"id":319259,"name":"national theatre"},{"id":351765,"name":"2025"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
