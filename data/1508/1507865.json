Over the course of 24 hours he must work tirelessly to satisfy his new client’s impossible tailoring needs.  But as the night goes on, it’s not just the trouser hems that start to fray as tensions rise and Walker’s friendships and relationships are pushed to their limits. His success comes at a cost, but what price is he willing to pay?  Lynette Linton (Blues for an Alabama Sky, Shifters) directs Michael Abbensetts’ (Sweet Talk, Empire Road) era-defining drama, with additional material by Trish Cooke, in its largest ever staging.  Celebrating this award-winning writer, the reinvigorated version of his seminal work illuminates the Guyanese experience of 1970s London and the aspirations and sacrifices of the Windrush generation.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/am2iABg0hk1ZwwfPJORG92UfR3L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"‘Is that what you want?
