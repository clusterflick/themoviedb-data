The Veggies have received letters from the VeggieTales Fan Club asking about how to be joyful even when you don't get what you want, how to truly love and how to get along on a team. Bob wants to make shows to help the kids, but there always seems to be some sort of calamity before the curtain goes up. Every show is set in Mr. Nezzer's theater and is filled with hilarious on-stage performances, silly songs and crazy backstage antics that both entertain and teach a lesson in Love, Joy and Peace. As part of the Bible's Fruit of the Spirit passage â€” the Veggies learn that these truths are a guide and help in any situation!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hhu6cejdfFvH6U3OCIkMKiyk7Q1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VeggieTales: Fruit of the Spirit Stories: Love, Joy, Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"VeggieTales Fruit of the Spirit Stories Love, Joy, Peace","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
