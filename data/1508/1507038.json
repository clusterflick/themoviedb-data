Their patients are their nearest and dearest who suffer from PTSD as a result of trauma incurred in their work in the triple zero services of Fire, Ambulance and Police, and the Australian Defence Force. Who cares for the Carers? We follow three individuals who are now reawakening their dreams. Join them as they find ways forward to love, to care and still be free to find their identity and fulfill their own needs. PTSD Love Stories combines observational documentary and re-enactment with animation, the film shines a light on mental health, trauma, PTSD, suicide, and stigma in the workplace.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who Cares for the Carers?","title":"PTSD Love Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5539032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arun Ketsirat","original_name":"Arun Ketsirat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6864969d32e249045949584e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5539033,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kym Melzer","original_name":"Kym Melzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686496d872c8b20fdef8410c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5539032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arun Ketsirat","original_name":"Arun Ketsirat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686496f8984607c6c3d1272d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317141,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Judy Yeh","original_name":"Judy Yeh","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6864974f459b7303f71f8308","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5539032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arun Ketsirat","original_name":"Arun Ketsirat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6864977a72c8b20fdef84119","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5539033,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kym Melzer","original_name":"Kym Melzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686497940a8cebe3b6eef6d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5539124,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Benjamin Stanic","original_name":"Benjamin Stanic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68649d561e3ca3f5c1eef71a","department":"Production","job":"Assistant Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5539141,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sarah Ward","original_name":"Sarah Ward","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68649e1773abe97b5feef6dc","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5539143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Marshall","original_name":"James Marshall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68649e505f1ca0512141491f","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5539145,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joseph R.
