He could call himself a successful, financially stable soviet writer. But he wanted more – to be free. The free West, especially Paris, was a life-long dream for Imermanis, but he was never allowed to leave the Soviet Union. So he created his own personal Paris – a bohemian lifestyle, sexual freedom, ignoring all puritan norms of the soviet world. He died alone without fulfilling his dream about Paris. But death was not a reason to give up – his last will was to be cremated and his ashes to be dispersed in Paris red light quarters.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":85171,"logo_path":"/1O7e8sk2hazDqDdK59ZehQHQQ7g.png","name":"Ego Media","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Last Will","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1747930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jānis Ābele","original_name":"Jānis Ābele","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":"/5W6q16LFlbePLs4G5Nxf7XGo8Jc.jpg","credit_id":"6865dde36e32cf58548f1b77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jānis Joņevs","original_name":"Jānis Joņevs","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6865de7f1b098d0036da427a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
