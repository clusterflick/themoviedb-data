On October 10, 1969, various factions, including Beheiren (Citizens' Alliance for Peace in Vietnam), Zenkyoto, and the Anti-War Youth Committee, joined forces and held rallies in parks in Yoyogi, Hibiya, and Shimizudani. The factions, which had rallied in multiple parks, gathered in Meiji Park in Tokyo. The demonstrators headed from Gaienmae to Aoyama-dori, where they were joined by ordinary citizens. It became a French demonstration, with people running hand in hand.In the film, a flag flutters for a moment, and the words \"KOKUIN, Joint Struggle to Destroy the Expo\" can be read. Two months earlier, members of the KOKUIN group had been arrested in connection with the \"Joint Struggle to Destroy the Expo,\" but after their release they took part in this anti-war rally. The commentary at the beginning of the film was written by Tamio Suenaga.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pw2kb7EVkE2HyLSQJ9JWjQg4V3L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anti-Vietnam War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5540888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamio Suenaga","original_name":"Tamio Suenaga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6865ddc4d4f3927d3c7055db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5540888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamio Suenaga","original_name":"Tamio Suenaga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6865ddf27bdbaba3ca8f1a4a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5540894,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Naoya Kuroki","original_name":"Naoya Kuroki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6865de1b17693b49a7705573","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1664,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pw2kb7EVkE2HyLSQJ9JWjQg4V3L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1109}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1969-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
