Margaret’s story becomes a springboard for an investigation of the political history of aged care in Australia, marred by a 40-year bipartisan privatisation agenda. As we hear from advocates, journalists and senior citizens who have experienced the system, a group of schoolkids discuss the situation we’ve reached with aged care and where we need to go from here – and of what they, and we, can expect in the future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Careless","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3869179,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sue Thomson","original_name":"Sue Thomson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6865179615759b23837840ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5539609,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lola Nankervis","original_name":"Lola Nankervis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686517a2d7c778eef4430bf5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2068046,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Farrington-Williams","original_name":"Adam Farrington-Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686517abde823cec4e6f62a4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3869179,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sue Thomson","original_name":"Sue Thomson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686517b21470ba2975414b0a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2068046,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Farrington-Williams","original_name":"Adam Farrington-Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686517c4ef48c113b58c28f6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3869179,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sue Thomson","original_name":"Sue Thomson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686517d0faea2154e95326a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830278,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben Bryan","original_name":"Ben Bryan","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686517e51470ba2975414b10","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1878158,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark D'Angelo","original_name":"Mark D'Angelo","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686517fc15759b23837840bd","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2068050,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Uri Mizrahi","original_name":"Uri Mizrahi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686518081470ba2975414b16","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
