However, because of the stress and pressure, he passes out while performing for the final screening. Because of this trauma, he no longer can go near the piano. When that boy collapses in a park, he's rescued by a man. The months and years pass, and the two have become acknowledged members of a certain underground conglomerate. One day the young man is involved in a drive by shooting and loses his memory, then turns back to the piano and begins to perform beautifully..... A musical in which the protagonist is wrapped in trauma, that follows him until he is determined to search for his path in life, with his friend as an axis, and the distractions of his feelings for the many women he loses his heart to.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aUXSTHfPYZ1HMj1M1j41sGoeRmG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Play -In the Form of Prayers-","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2425405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Sena","original_name":"瀬奈じゅん","popularity":0.2213,"profile_path":"/p7BzfdNTbzpRXZYvTtbIi0slCCE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Alistair","credit_id":"6866c26830e39567915cf73d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3533559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiriya Hiromu","original_name":"霧矢大夢","popularity":0.8905,"profile_path":"/htHzExODogYCWKrcgsr6Y45xVAj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Moore","credit_id":"6866c2764434ed512875c2e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4027011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Misa Noeru","original_name":"Misa Noeru","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":"/9dbkxOakVPTK4Emfc58nIpge9nS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Graham","credit_id":"6866c2802485fede86fcba7f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koshino Ryuu","original_name":"Koshino Ryuu","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ernesto","credit_id":"6866c2899d9ff3dc0e765e68","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4826401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanase Mizuka","original_name":"Hanase Mizuka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rosa","credit_id":"6866c293f3ed8cf364789d5d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seijou Kaito","original_name":"Seijou Kaito","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Aloys","credit_id":"6866c2a5f0bc3e87828237d6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3073407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masaki Ryū","original_name":"龍真咲","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/gPKvORRXU3SaK8Gh3KqAkIN14mb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Christopher","credit_id":"6866c2b2490b6b4f2e241b3d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2706179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rio Asumi","original_name":"明日海りお","popularity":0.2848,"profile_path":"/8Vj0dTfg9wuDnbz1JAD8EC9A73T.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Maximilian","credit_id":"6866c2ccabe9beb510f7c1ab","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3383812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ranno Hana","original_name":"Ranno Hana","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/pQJRt1NGY3OoQB5RvqlRYHDgKWA.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Pauline","credit_id":"6866c2d5db7caa99e7f7c199","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3398416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masatsuka Haruhiko","original_name":"正塚晴彦","popularity":0.1712,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6866c2e6589c81e1c7241b35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4rpRz3G0buC3pINJmlmByM1ydUP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aUXSTHfPYZ1HMj1M1j41sGoeRmG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
