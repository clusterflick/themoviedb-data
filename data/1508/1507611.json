It tells the story of this ongoing tragic chapter through the lens of Armenian-American journalist and LGBTQ+ activist Vic Gerami. Through a journalist’s perspective, ARTSAKH documents Azerbaijan’s and Turkey’s unprovoked genocidal attack and ethnic cleansing against Armenians of Artsakh, also known as Nagorno-Karabakh, starting on September 27, 2020. Azerbaijan, with the declared assistance from Turkey, launched a large-scale offensive against Artsakh. In its war effort, Azerbaijan relied on thousands of Turkish-paid jihadist mercenaries airlifted from terrorist camps in Syria, Libya, and Pakistan and brought to fight alongside the Azerbaijani Army. For 44 days, the world watched mainly in deafening silence as over 5,000+ Armenians were massacred.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8HQAah2soaYtA23kiEiGa9aPCpm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Artsakh Genocide","title":"ARTSAKH Armenian Genocide Continues","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":2157,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8HQAah2soaYtA23kiEiGa9aPCpm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1448}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
