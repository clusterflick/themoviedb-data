Not knowing who to trust, Casey flees, using her intelligence and resourcefulness to stay hidden and the signs of divine guidance to help her in her journey. Meanwhile, Dylan Roberts, a war-weary veteran and private investigator with PTSD, is hired to track her down. As Dylan digs deeper into the case, he begins to suspect that Casey might actually be innocent and that the real story is far more complex—and dangerous—than it first appeared.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6345,"logo_path":"/pctomojbRLZNdYB0muFoZiaYdPI.png","name":"Lighthouse Pictures","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":170390,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fezziwig Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2025-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Terri Blackstock's If I Run","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":159962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kat Graham","original_name":"Kat Graham","popularity":1.6789,"profile_path":"/gZb5Xz2eKZqDy4hXgTEtvyTvRq4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Casey Cox","credit_id":"686599a25f38c7f7a58e635c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2194273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Roderick","original_name":"Evan Roderick","popularity":0.7029,"profile_path":"/nyvCM1XGkh3bAIx1IFgZFuBfpVh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dylan Roberts","credit_id":"686599ab3cf5e2f97731f724","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Tupper","original_name":"James Tupper","popularity":0.7253,"profile_path":"/juB7BiVfi1M8H8YbL3XdUGcnFhf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"68659a22e12e92fd80da41a0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5540557,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Terri Blackstock","original_name":"Terri Blackstock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686599c136e7cdc9398f1a21","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael M.
