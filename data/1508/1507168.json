This film recounts the lives of fishermen and fisherwomen at the beginning and end of the Moon River where it joins the Mekong, on the border between Thailand and Laos. Each place - and its people - is confronted with the modification of the river landscape by the man-made dam, but their stories and the impact on their lives are contrasting. One community has started to learn how to fish, while the other is counting the names of lost fish and tools. The concept of light and darkness derives from the brightness of the moon and its shadows, and the contrast between the two sides of the river reveals the inequality of fates.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/ZHt78hnVNxOL9dRQ5OsGQjHsFP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Sides of the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5466711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Som Supaparinya","original_name":"Som Supaparinya","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686504d3b916e1f47cbb3c79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ZHt78hnVNxOL9dRQ5OsGQjHsFP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"th","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
