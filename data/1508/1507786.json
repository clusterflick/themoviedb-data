Set entirely on a rooftop, the film explores themes of isolation, emotional stillness, and the quiet unraveling of the human spirit. Through minimal dialogue and expressive visuals, Rooftop offers a poignant meditation on fleeting time and internal struggle.  Starring Kamran Ahmad and directed by Hosh-e-Ruba (Kamran Ahmad) and Khwaabgari (Khizer Zaman), with story by Khwaabgari, the film is set to Max Richterâ€™s haunting composition On the Nature of Daylight.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gdpthTiIANj6YZyw0cHhvHSEehf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":266938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Khwaabgari","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"}],"release_date":"2025-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Moments before death","title":"A ROOFTOP","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","title":"A ROOFTOP","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5488516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kamran Ahmed Khan","original_name":"Kamran Ahmed Khan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Young boy","credit_id":"68669cbf0672d0f802da447d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5542054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"KHIZER ZAMAN","original_name":"KHIZER ZAMAN","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68669d18f1784c1de9705913","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5542054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"KHIZER ZAMAN","original_name":"KHIZER ZAMAN","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6867ad2426be2697826772cd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5488516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kamran Ahmed Khan","original_name":"Kamran Ahmed Khan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6867ae00a471486ea779e246","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"Khwaabgari","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8QX1IKtWRpt41eYu2MAuyX80wn6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.756,"height":1560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gdpthTiIANj6YZyw0cHhvHSEehf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1180}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":335871,"name":"roof-top"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A ROOFTOP | 1 MINUTE SHORT FILM","key":"nMbjpdZ5XDE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-07-03T14:08:05.000Z","id":"68678e5dbe0fb4fef5eeb417"}]}}}
