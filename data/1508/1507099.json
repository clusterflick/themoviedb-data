Most of these refugees were diagnosed as HIV positive, and for that reason were not being allowed into the U.S. In addition, they did not receive adequate medical attention at the Camp for their condition. Donovan Cole, a former U.S. soldier in Guantanamo, tells of the horrendous conditions and treatment the Haitians were forced to endure while at the Camp. The refugees were released in 1993 by order of Judge Sterling Johnson, Jr., of the U.S. District Court of Appeals after being detained for almost two years","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guantanamo Notes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
