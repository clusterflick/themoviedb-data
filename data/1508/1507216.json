The film was created with the support of folklorists Irina Romodina and Alexander Romodin.  Cinematography by Alexander Sokolkov (Moscow).  Produced for the art channel ZDF (Berlin) with participation from Jochen Krausser and Ulrike Hunt (Bonn).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mOqb4gJQoOvGLlCwAPhsfRzdMcj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“A farewell to those who sang the soul of the land.”","title":"Farewell to Mekhov","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/mOqb4gJQoOvGLlCwAPhsfRzdMcj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2000-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
