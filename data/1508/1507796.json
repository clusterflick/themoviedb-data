He works as a Hand Raker on the mussel beds in North Wales alongside his younger brother, Dyfan, and Dyfan’s three sons. Jack has always assumed that his own boy, Tom, will join the family business on leaving school but Tom’s resistance to follow in his footsteps creates familial tension. Tensions are further inflamed by the arrival of an itinerant deckhand, Daniel, who makes known his feelings for Jack. In this remote, rural community where life revolves around Church and fishery, Jack is faced with an impossible dilemma. On The Sea is a beautiful, sensual and at times, tragic exploration of masculinity, place and desire.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/iLy6f6LMMIrcGbnRAKQFDMEACwh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Union Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"On the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Ward","original_name":"Barry Ward","popularity":0.2239,"profile_path":"/3cIhm76aPUvJdIa9GbGrzhAL5GF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jack","credit_id":"68669d728101ec53419c2e7f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1034703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorne MacFadyen","original_name":"Lorne MacFadyen","popularity":2.9656,"profile_path":"/y1cdclslL2nNkFw5RVj64iAHIIb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Daniel","credit_id":"68669d8d519b363dc37058d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz White","original_name":"Liz White","popularity":0.9187,"profile_path":"/8DLHz7kZFl0bUwPm67NRnDTaG8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maggie","credit_id":"68669d9c2816f90a42c118da","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2209728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Lawfull","original_name":"Henry Lawfull","popularity":0.1565,"profile_path":"/csiZffsmwifkFrd91APNnJwCCw1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"68669da686f1f309c7743419","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":206161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celyn Jones","original_name":"Celyn Jones","popularity":0.5984,"profile_path":"/7aDQ4sZDyWAhUx15jlPhQPm9apH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dyfan","credit_id":"68669db50a2a4a7434c11872","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Walsh","original_name":"Helen Walsh","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68669dd4d0a4c7766e743375","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Walsh","original_name":"Helen Walsh","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68669ddf753b16619e9c2f7a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545152,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sam Goldie","original_name":"Sam Goldie","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68669df2d7e74f867f7bf96c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31936369","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yS3Eb0vnlN3gwiMsuPVRp91jDVx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iLy6f6LMMIrcGbnRAKQFDMEACwh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Edinburgh International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
