After years in the 12-step programme of Alcoholics Anonymous, James becomes a sponsor to newcomer Luka. The pair bond over black coffee, trade stories and build a fragile friendship out of their shared experiences. But as Luka approaches step five – the moment of confession – dangerous truths emerge, threatening the trust on which both of their recoveries depend.  Finn den Hertog directs the provocative and entertaining production filmed live from @sohoplace on London’s West End.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6lA6FDmP6YZV9CO8K9VhWmmcwyz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115529,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Theatre of Scotland","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16355,"logo_path":"/tWuPpLrD2urqKPXIit4VLTHWvgK.png","name":"National Theatre","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":119326,"logo_path":"/58wErOVuOWMOlRBy4UDQRXPiKBk.png","name":"Playful Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":1522,"logo_path":"/8uaoEVgNxFH0R94O53gUiByahVr.png","name":"Neal Street Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NT Live: The Fifth Step","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1334638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Lowden","original_name":"Jack Lowden","popularity":1.3137,"profile_path":"/3wSE6uHLkslE9xvRiMbnphuI0VK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Luka","credit_id":"6865e1660c97448b7731f871","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Freeman","original_name":"Martin Freeman","popularity":2.3849,"profile_path":"/pLG7mmxBXXTVAgzXvQl0ap3qlJU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"James","credit_id":"6865e17b535c63316931f89c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ireland","original_name":"David Ireland","popularity":0.1422,"profile_path":"/kiCdNLQ6tQ1l9lWp78thFuVm9fF.jpg","credit_id":"6865e1ab36dd07ed3131f7e8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1626601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Finn den Hertog","original_name":"Finn den Hertog","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":"/r6x2OkSXlfVtzBuomzPVXAzGRlj.jpg","credit_id":"6865e1c32370ef35f9da42a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5540946,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Milla Clarke","original_name":"Milla Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6865e1df5fba8d8d5e9c2ce5","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9dXwJwaJJPwlAhxb53Fy6kPdN4o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wCwLG61Ac4AitGGGaaJltjGHbAG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ymQ3OojDi9DUFqMROtnTerfwz3k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6lA6FDmP6YZV9CO8K9VhWmmcwyz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
