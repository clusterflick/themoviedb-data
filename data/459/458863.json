Working and growing together since 1993, their collaborations have produced unobtrusive yet elegant images that complement songs from across the band's discography. The DVD is a trim package with only nine videos in roughly 40 minutes, yet it excels as a document of thoughtful visual poetry, an evolving symbiotic relationship, and a convenient condensation of the group's achievements over the past decade [upon release]. In other words, Bareback can be appreciated for its visual and aural qualities, both independent of and in combination with each other.","popularity":0.0909,"poster_path":"/5QRrqk3pSGTBfARnL7ETr6WcGOH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90006,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warp Records","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tindersticks: Bareback","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483091,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stuart Staples","original_name":"Stuart Staples","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d9c241d439be100127920f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Boulter","original_name":"Dave Boulter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5951cbe79251412b23017947","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Colwill","original_name":"Mark Colwill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5951cbee92514128e1018699","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Frazer","original_name":"Neil Frazer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5951cbf4c3a3681388018bcb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53712,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dickon Hinchliffe","original_name":"Dickon Hinchliffe","popularity":0.1502,"profile_path":"/83nvbDqwG99HXYajNfLw47rJoCJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d9c23f76b5fc20029d7f588","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2428066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alasdair Macauley","original_name":"Alasdair Macauley","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d9c2403d388ae002713cfa1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Wallace","original_name":"Martin Wallace","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5951cbdec3a3680d730155c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1182327","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5QRrqk3pSGTBfARnL7ETr6WcGOH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
