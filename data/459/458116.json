Hoping to move up in the world, Leslie and David decide to start pitching a glossier project around town, and they score a deal with a major studio to make a mid-budget science fiction-thriller. However, Leslie and David soon find themselves butting heads with the head of the studio, and when the financing is pulled from their project, they find themselves trying to finish it on a budget even they find impossible. Jason Priestley, Neve Campbell, and Dean Devlin all make cameo appearances as themselves.","popularity":0.644,"poster_path":"/545lWrmLelXWhCv8c7mhY7GG7s2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lighthead Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A new comedy about Hollywood, Aliens, and Vodka!","title":"Predators from Beyond Neptune","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neve Campbell","original_name":"Neve Campbell","popularity":1.9233,"profile_path":"/8DZiZ0TyKguNFYSn603rtIUzNOw.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"591cd6589251414a57011355","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Caldwell","original_name":"Tim Caldwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Groppo, King of Pluto","credit_id":"591cd666c3a3687a4b011120","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8676,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dean Devlin","original_name":"Dean Devlin","popularity":0.5366,"profile_path":"/lO8HDHI3aVrpVubWb2DH1jeqM40.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"591cd678c3a36878fe010cbb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196728,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stephen Eckelberry","original_name":"Stephen Eckelberry","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Bill Goodwyn","credit_id":"591cd6989251414990011f73","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818857,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tony Ferriter","original_name":"Tony Ferriter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Barton Bachs","credit_id":"591cd7799251414a57011449","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Gill","original_name":"Bob Gill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Crazy Toymaker","credit_id":"591cd7b29251414a7b011f41","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Harvey","original_name":"Robert Harvey","popularity":0.273,"profile_path":"/pmby45cirYiKe7NvqPe38zog0UL.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Lance Wright","credit_id":"591cd7ccc3a368723d012a95","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Hill","original_name":"Ashley Hill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Leslie Miller","credit_id":"591cd7fb92514149900120a6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Mabbutt","original_name":"Scott Mabbutt","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"591cd81a925141482f011d35","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracy Langan","original_name":"Tracy Langan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Studio Lawyer","credit_id":"591cd823925141485e0129f2","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shannon K.
