He raised funds, filmed Almada, interviewed him and worked on this multimedia project for several years, even after the artist's death. The result was a complex artistic work, with three simultaneous projections of slides and film, music by Jorge Peixinho and the incorporation of other projects by Ernesto de Sousa. In a text titled \"Anticinema\" he would write: \"i do not make a movie / about almada / i make a movie with almada\".","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":"/12DKmCknMwdooEudPNIjBkbdPcf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Almada, Um Nome de Guerra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernesto de Sousa","original_name":"Ernesto de Sousa","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591c59bdc3a368774e00b9ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.06,"height":1096,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aXNdqWKoynKUmcvyUSz9usqE4xz.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2258}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.74,"height":1352,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/12DKmCknMwdooEudPNIjBkbdPcf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
