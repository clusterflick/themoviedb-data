Devastated, Jessica sued her local police department for failing to adequately enforce her domestic violence restraining order despite her repeated calls for help that night. Determined to make sure her daughters did not die in vain, Jessica pursues her case to the US Supreme Court and an international human rights tribunal, seeking to strengthen legal rights for domestic violence victims. Meanwhile, her relationship with her one surviving child, her son Jessie, suffers, as he struggles with the tragedy in his own way. Shot over the course of nine years, Home Truth chronicles one family’s incredible pursuit of justice, shedding light on how our society responds to domestic violence and how the trauma from domestic violence can linger through generations.","popularity":0.3334,"poster_path":"/53v0P7iM0G7Tf6LZPgGEQiZOHsE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home Truth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1641162,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eliott Taylor","original_name":"Eliott Taylor","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/3RbDyL42fRLBiJd8c6H9LjNDGGZ.jpg","credit_id":"65d56355f29d66017de8f25d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1499444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"April Hayes","original_name":"April Hayes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591f2274c3a3687a64035937","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1499457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katia Maguire","original_name":"Katia Maguire","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591f2284c3a3687a4b03359a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/53v0P7iM0G7Tf6LZPgGEQiZOHsE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11925,"name":"domestic violence"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
