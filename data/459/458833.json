It would appear that together these filmmakers go by the name of P.S.Y.C.H.O. Productions (you can't help but notice that half the cast is wearing that company's t-shirt). I wouldn't have thought that a low budget comedy about cannibals that runs close to 120 minutes would be something I'd enjoy, but it turns out I was very wrong.","popularity":0.2301,"poster_path":"/qhQd19pxrSHFVk98UzZi566CSYK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34828,"logo_path":null,"name":"P.S.Y.C.H.O.
