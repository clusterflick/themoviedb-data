The strain becomes so overwhelming that it leads many students down the path of rebellion. Mr. Tai (Lui Wai-hung) is a dedicated, albeit nerdy, high school biology teacher who finds himself with his hands full, contending with a group of troublesome teenagers. These unruly students go to great lengths to make Mr. Tai’s life a living nightmare, often with comically disastrous consequences.  Amidst this chaos, Ye Feng plays the role of the father of the protagonist. He inadvertently gets caught up in the raucous antics and pandemonium that unfold within the school. This film marked Ye Feng’s final appearance in cinema.","popularity":0.4228,"poster_path":"/5RDHc3qarzYbZsunDkiGchvZvjz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76418,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kay's Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1981-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Sir with Troubles","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"To Sir With Troubles","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Yi Lui","original_name":"James Yi Lui","popularity":0.2023,"profile_path":"/nHLuXvK6PemSM3WOsiROyFZ4RG.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Teacher","credit_id":"591c47189251414a7b00a294","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":544779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moon Lee Choi-Fung","original_name":"李賽鳳","popularity":0.6186,"profile_path":"/2wTS5wK0tlbtHvNYm8AwiAG5PNf.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3a9ec1ab68493a2a849bda","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":998678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Wai-Hung","original_name":"廖偉雄","popularity":0.4971,"profile_path":"/ardsrPTdd2qQsm0tW5WqEDu0hNl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mr. Tai","credit_id":"591c472fc3a3687a8e009c2d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29693,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Wu","original_name":"David Wu","popularity":0.3196,"profile_path":"/coGYkBJEQoBgGn5KM61rZ7eMSrD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"591c47669251414a57009bde","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lau Si-Hong","original_name":"Lau Si-Hong","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"591c47409251414add009f9d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1567054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yau Fung","original_name":"Yau Fung","popularity":0.1313,"profile_path":"/aqex8OHYpCH6m7GQKIkhHuUOZvs.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5a014cc7c3a368071101153c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Lam Wai-Kin","original_name":"Oscar Lam Wai-Kin","popularity":0.5264,"profile_path":"/ulpmy1qjsF90hi15wn5zWbcA6FC.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"64fcfcf7ffc9de0edf5f18ba","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":562296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wong Wa-Kei","original_name":"Wong Wa-Kei","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591c47c9925141485e00a986","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1671560,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laai Hon-choh","original_name":"Laai Hon-choh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591c47c0c3a368799b009cc4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":562296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wong Wa-Kei","original_name":"Wong Wa-Kei","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591c47d09251414a7b00a31d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":562296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wong Wa-Kei","original_name":"Wong Wa-Kei","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591c485bc3a36878fe009886","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0121420","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5RDHc3qarzYbZsunDkiGchvZvjz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"1981-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
