Mentioned in Icelandic manuscripts and speculated about for over two centuries, Vinland is known as \"the place where the wild grapes grow\" and was thought to be on the eastern coast between Virginia and Newfoundland. In 1960 a curious group of house mounds was uncovered at l'Anse aux Meadows in northern Newfoundland by Drs. Helge Ingstad and Anne Stine Ingstad of Norway. Added to the United Nations World Heritage List, l'Anse aux Meadows is considered one of the most important archaeological sites in the world.","popularity":0.4939,"poster_path":"/v7PC0EAnq6z2S9VjFDUS87CASGi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Vinland Mystery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3911511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Granik","original_name":"Jon Granik","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63e3c44cdb154f00ded268e9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Pettigrew","original_name":"William Pettigrew","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e3c3bbfac502007c5a0317","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1870502,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Don Virgo","original_name":"Don Virgo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e3c3c25ca70400c6e06d06","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826617,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Simon Leblanc","original_name":"Simon Leblanc","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e3c3d11283e9008e4883e4","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1499546,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bev Davidson","original_name":"Bev Davidson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e3c3dc7304b50092e760b5","department":"Sound","job":"Location Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1697300,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"André Vincelli","original_name":"André Vincelli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e3c3e4fac50200f330d158","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2934884,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Louis Hone","original_name":"Louis Hone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e3c3fefac502007c5a0329","department":"Sound","job":"Music Sound Design and Processing"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2599324,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Knight","original_name":"John Knight","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e3c4095ca70400a7d37a5b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354861,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Pierre Joutel","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Joutel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e3c4155ca7040084dcdb32","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":582534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Spence","original_name":"Bob Spence","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e3c4275ca70400a7d37a65","department":"Production","job":"Administration"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Pettigrew","original_name":"William Pettigrew","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e3c4317304b5007e64c0fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barrie Howells","original_name":"Barrie Howells","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wl9j33wHjYwssXlzwnlDwjyFBRX.jpg","credit_id":"63e3c43bfac50200c349f4dd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Pettigrew","original_name":"William Pettigrew","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591cb416925141482f01013b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v7PC0EAnq6z2S9VjFDUS87CASGi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":713},{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kkNLYxq14PQhmkyb6nmFbEIaCdi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":714},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zWyEhlIURwkfcLaQiAPI75BZdbs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1191,"name":"norway"},{"id":184134,"name":"archeology"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
