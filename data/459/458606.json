Mafavuke Ngcobo was a traditional herbalist who was accused by the local white medical establishment of ‘untraditional behaviour’. The film explores the ideological and commercial confrontation between two different yet intertwining medicinal traditions and their uses of plants, with slippages across gender and race further questioning notions of purity and origination. The re-imagined court case is filmed at the Palace of Justice in Pretoria, where the Rivonia trial was held that sent Mandela and his fellow accused to Robben Island prison.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Crown Against Mafavuke","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uriel Orlow","original_name":"Uriel Orlow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59222d049251414990060199","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uriel Orlow","original_name":"Uriel Orlow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59222cfc925141499006018e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
