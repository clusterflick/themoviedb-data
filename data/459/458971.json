JEKYLL AND MISS OSBOURNE. Utilising the materials of the complete, restored version of the film, and its French language soundtrack, the film offers a new way of looking at, understanding and appreciating Borowczyk's intensely cinematic art. Particular attention is paid to a painting by Vermeer of a pregnant woman, introduced early into Borowczyk's film, and reappearing at key moments. Beginning from this painting - its content, style, and historical background - particular aspects of the film are explored: its unusual pictorial compositions; the mingling of sexuality with violence; and the association of men and women with (respectively) open and closed spaces. The film argues that Borowczyk brings a surrealist sensibility to his free adaptation of the Jekyll and Hyde story, especially emphasizing the transgressive, revolutionary role of the free-spirited Lucy Osbourne.","popularity":0.4461,"poster_path":"/j1IGFvDelNq4DwkLpF4V1NjUM2U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phantasmagoria of the Interior","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Pierro","original_name":"Marina Pierro","popularity":0.4228,"profile_path":"/u52gZquc1BszJ1uRbsVMFql9Jyc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fanny Osbourne","credit_id":"592613379251413ba001528e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Udo Kier","original_name":"Udo Kier","popularity":1.106,"profile_path":"/8bD9dTPML8JZgkCzUu2tUN8byOG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Henry Jekyll","credit_id":"5926134cc3a368787001512a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1823065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristina Álvarez López","original_name":"Cristina Álvarez López","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59260ff49251413b5b016bd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1823066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Martin","original_name":"Adrian Martin","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592610319251413b5401579e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7591772","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j1IGFvDelNq4DwkLpF4V1NjUM2U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Digital release","release_date":"2015-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD release","release_date":"2015-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
