While Jochebed (Venus Monique) hides in a shelter to protect her son from being murdered, she tells him the story of her people over the course of a dangerous night. This film explores the idea that mankind will one day return to the place where we started, but that the journey will be filled with hardship, beauty, and a desperate need to trust the Creator.","popularity":0.3941,"poster_path":"/qf6FGaNPQGiEzDWau8dEh72xkpU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101081,"logo_path":null,"name":"Austin Ridge Bible Church","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Eden is still in our blood.","title":"The Book of Genesis","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":27,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Γένεση","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"O Livro de Gênesis","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Venus Monique","original_name":"Venus Monique","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jochebed","credit_id":"5a889e8c9251417599056679","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cabil Gibbs","original_name":"Cabil Gibbs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Abraham","credit_id":"5a889e98c3a36862e1057f85","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Jones","original_name":"Jordan Jones","popularity":0.0583,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Joseph","credit_id":"5a889eb3c3a3686207055cfc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivia Jordan","original_name":"Olivia Jordan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Eve","credit_id":"5a889ed80e0a2653b305889d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avery Merrifield","original_name":"Avery Merrifield","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Adam","credit_id":"5a889eec9251410ac40553d2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitchell Rad","original_name":"Mitchell Rad","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Noah","credit_id":"5a889f0bc3a36863e7055a03","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675398,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Craig S.
