They learn how easy it is to be a bully if you're not kind to people. Learning to be a friend has much better results. Meanwhile, Mr. Quigley tells the story of a little kid who saved a town by teaching a clumsy giant to tie his shoes. Helping our friends and others around us causes us to grow in our faith and walk with Jesus. It, also, helps the community we live in, if we are willing to be friends to all people.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Friendship","title":"The Simply Grand Quigley Band: Small Wonders and Giant Blunders","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
