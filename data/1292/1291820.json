The background is pitch black, and he is lit with an almost otherworldly glow. The artist recorded at two frames per second, rather than the typical twenty-four, speeding up the erratic movement. He occasionally flips upside down or appears in blue and green colourised layers on top of the colourless original. A high-intensity electronic track, ‘Pulstar’, by the Greek musician Vangelis, accompanies the video and accentuates its volatile energy.","popularity":0.1667,"poster_path":"/lKadWLZyvq4UHbshy9WgT1TrC96.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Face in Motion","title":"Face in Motion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Chao-Tang","original_name":"張照堂","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":"/43U7LH5tnW9KQvgWYwDMC7gQ0SD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66479ee4a0f7144e44921b95","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Chao-Tang","original_name":"張照堂","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":"/43U7LH5tnW9KQvgWYwDMC7gQ0SD.jpg","credit_id":"66479e902319669d9c9210b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":595,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vangelis","original_name":"Vangelis","popularity":0.3954,"profile_path":"/7qSj7Dk0mMytSxSHTsSIi4tmgnu.jpg","credit_id":"66479ea8a17f2bc5d62e0772","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1296,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5EygBmaV1ALYoSgHZdOHDAuAvb7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2303}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lKadWLZyvq4UHbshy9WgT1TrC96.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1403}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"},{"id":308818,"name":"avant garde"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
