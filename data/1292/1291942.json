This period, when the body is at rest and sensory input is more or less inactive, is in fact a time of intense activity for the brain. This documentary, which interweaves informative interviews with internationally renowned researchers and vivid graphics gives a clear explanation of what happens to us during those unconscious hours. Sleeping soundly enhances psychological well being and productivity, while sleep disorders undermine mental and physical health.Some of the topics covered are: the stages of sleep; its role in restoring the bodyâ€™s metabolic energy; sleep cycles and circadian rhythms; the role of melatonin; sleep disorders, and adaptations during aging. The film includes footage of early sleep deprivation experiments and offers interesting tidbits on the sleep habits of Dali, Napoleon and Einstein. Among the experts represented are psychologist William Dement from Stanford University and neuropsychologist Allan Hobson from Harvard.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":"/udh5a4yv83DUcedMjzkDxEg8UCx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sleep and Its Secrets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4720563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brigitte Holzinger","original_name":"Brigitte Holzinger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66481d0c24159ce9d42e4401","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4720564,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karina Resller","original_name":"Karina Resller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66481d15184a463172923143","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/udh5a4yv83DUcedMjzkDxEg8UCx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
