This is ballet in 2024. But a group of defiant dancers, survivors of industry abuse, want to form a radical, diverse company that opens its doors to others who have also suffered abuse, and gives these talented, traumatized survivors a chance to fight back, on stage. They find a run-down studio, and Chase Johnsey, a gender-fluid dance insurgent, to direct them. But, they have no money, no reputation, and Chase has never directed before. The dancers are brave, but young and deeply fragile. They must confront their traumas and find belief if they are ever to retake the stage. It is a journey of pain, hope, and above all resistance -to fight for justice, change lives, and create groundbreaking, liberated ballet- one choreographed step at a time.","popularity":0.1061,"poster_path":"/skFlWiFNnukbVPXlGxHPOacf4Ma.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103675,"logo_path":null,"name":"OTOXO Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Catal√†"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Reistance.
