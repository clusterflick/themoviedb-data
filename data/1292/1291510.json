The Mozart trademark is now worth no less than 5 billion Euro, not to mention the music, which is so worth listening to. We at MTV (Mozart TV) decided to be part of this celebration. So we created a quiz in a true \"WWBM \" style and entitled it \"Who Wants to be a Mozart\". The host of the programme is Mr Antonio Salieri, who is the master of ceremonies to ten competitors: Lizst, Rossini, Beethoven, Tschaikovsky, Bach, Schubert, Mussorgsky, Falco and Mozart himself, who wishes to gain one million Euro like the rest of the competitors and claim back at least a tiny slice of the cake, which countless others have earned by exploiting his name and music.","popularity":0.234,"poster_path":"/1mItfpYz2w1533Pnlz1fqRmAD66.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV
