Despite the warm welcome and encouragement she receives there, very soon Win-yee faces setbacks and realises she is falling behind her peers.  It is the friendship and support of warm-hearted Christy that eventually helps Wing-yee through her initial confusion and self-doubt, and she gradually develops a fondness for this beautiful roommate. Filmed between wintry Canada and mild Hong Kong, the short offers a poetic tale of two cities, about young passion, loss, and loneliness.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6eIptzn06yi2h1GX13RtVAlgiGr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landing On Ice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4717235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Lee Wing-hei","original_name":"Nicole Lee Wing-hei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"664583c6c4cb86b6efcfd5db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4717236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Mercer","original_name":"Julia Mercer","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"664583e98ee7f81e2d91e1fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4717237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brett Brohman","original_name":"Brett Brohman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"664583fbabe7563b1591d5db","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4054184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Leung Chi-Tung","original_name":"Jane Leung Chi-Tung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664582e7a254a55496bd6451","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4054184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Leung Chi-Tung","original_name":"Jane Leung Chi-Tung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66458326903ded84a83afcc5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6eIptzn06yi2h1GX13RtVAlgiGr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
