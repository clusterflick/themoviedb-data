The film unfolds in central Kyiv, in a space that has been reclaimed from the city by forces of nature. As a result of a series of landslides, the area of Petrivska street has become untenable and was subsequently occupied by the outcasts and outsiders of all kinds. A secretive graffiti team, a group of tech geeks and an avant-garde gay theatre that fled the war in Luhansk all struggle to create a place where they could coexist outside the pressure of dysfunctional social structures. - DAfilms","popularity":0.2359,"poster_path":"/q06en2wKXlsSsCZHLm88zFfmEWe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landslide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4649573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mykhailo Koptev","original_name":"Mykhailo Koptev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"666b8823ab30f317105ab9b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4774087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ira Novikova","original_name":"Ira Novikova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"666b8858c390f26ea6317e78","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4774088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Snitkus","original_name":"Arthur Snitkus","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"666b88849153af4637080683","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4774093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yura Antonov","original_name":"Yura Antonov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"666b88c2f6866a302608068d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4774094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sasha Pavlov","original_name":"Sasha Pavlov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"666b88e458bf091bed38337c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4774096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Davyd Chychkan","original_name":"Davyd Chychkan","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"666b890410e874b88aa7a8b9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4774099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dana Kosmina","original_name":"Dana Kosmina","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"666b892822c29c5df538339d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4774101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denys Teno","original_name":"Denys Teno","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"666b89402f2d14fd1c7621ea","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4774102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Doper","original_name":"Anton Doper","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"666b8953fe4b117782cd2907","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2312788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksiy Radynski","original_name":"Олексій Радинський","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/oS5f8bt3dRGZ1WcAuEenDvn7UYp.jpg","credit_id":"664769053f44dc5e377875aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2614270,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Max Savchenko","original_name":"Max Savchenko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6647691634617fd7ff3462a9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4719753,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sasha Bojko","original_name":"Sasha Bojko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6647692e2319669d9c920e3a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4504817,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olexandr Gorbunov","original_name":"Olexandr Gorbunov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6647694082e0c772262f404e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":1461,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q06en2wKXlsSsCZHLm88zFfmEWe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
