Using mostly stock footage, this collage-like documentary “stars” Robert Redford, John Gavin and Superman in an exploration of the largest border separating the First and the Third World—that separating the United States of Mexico from the United States of America. Incorporating texts by Octavio Paz and others, images from Mexican melodramas and Hollywood movies, this film forces American viewers to consider the question of cultural imperialism from “the other side.”","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/6P147A2KuIbXj6lhZqTdmh5N5mL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Here, From This Side","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4718481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gloria Ribe","original_name":"Gloria Ribe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664677a5ee8cab60d7782e7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6P147A2KuIbXj6lhZqTdmh5N5mL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
