For this project, each of the Polish brothers will write and direct one half of the movie without one knowing anything about the other's work, resulting in two separate storylines that will be interwoven into a single feature-length film. This approach will enable each brother to explore the nature of the twin relationship from their own unique perspective without being influenced or constrained by the other's vision.","popularity":1.0802,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7417,"logo_path":"/13GyIWMzFvDqJN6I6tZCQYzWr7L.png","name":"Convergence Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"There There","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Polish","original_name":"Mark Polish","popularity":0.2868,"profile_path":"/5HmEhRjyZa1xIiXQeZALsOmm01E.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6647ccbce3aa523b96f642f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Polish","original_name":"Michael Polish","popularity":0.2421,"profile_path":"/gcwCq1ap4gbSf4Ip3qaTLR7PLFS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6647ccc3ccb34dfb1b11e228","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gretchen Mol","original_name":"Gretchen Mol","popularity":0.8112,"profile_path":"/e3C1D1I09gtSGy4Ej1ewW2FFoew.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6647cd09d53ae967c0a5dcb1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shannyn Sossamon","original_name":"Shannyn Sossamon","popularity":1.3908,"profile_path":"/wb8IqhUm3j5epCiw6UwIV3nfNQR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6647cd12b7786825aa63065d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corbin Bernsen","original_name":"Corbin Bernsen","popularity":1.5113,"profile_path":"/zkftLlEO5fmKmcKienRKw9Gx0U9.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6647cd1cccb34dfb1b11e233","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zack Pearlman","original_name":"Zack Pearlman","popularity":0.5305,"profile_path":"/ez93T66xMaCycaw5aoh61o6FO2H.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6647cd2b0d6cd6f50f2f3bcc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Logan Polish","original_name":"Logan Polish","popularity":0.2957,"profile_path":"/zqABntvul41SPc7FWwCewRedGRc.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6647cd5ed53ae967c0a5dcbb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"D.W.
