Half performance and half presentation of trace, the work charts the repeated physical and psychological damage sustained by both players in endless replay. While Tatum’s mark-making on the gallery walls is the result of a series of running drills conducted while he impacts a cast clay weight, other gestures belie something more ominous. One of the first NFL players to be diagnosed with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, Stabler leaves his imprint with a metal barbell and clay weight attached to his skull.","popularity":0.0652,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DRAWING RESTRAINT 26","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Barney","original_name":"Matthew Barney","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/d7huIJFX311Q5RiSTgjDvo6FNqy.jpg","credit_id":"6646377ba10ed68e1b246d6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
