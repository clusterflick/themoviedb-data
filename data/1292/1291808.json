He had a brilliant career as the head of culture, the royal theatres, and Swedish academy. He quickly raced to the top both politically and militarily. An eccentric and aggressive character. His relationship to Miss Magdalena Rudenschöld remains one of the most passionate in Swedish history. An extraordinary person's portrayal, from a nobody to one of Sweden's most powerful men, in such a short time.","popularity":0.122,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gunstlingen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Ulfsäter","original_name":"Richard Ulfsäter","popularity":0.3502,"profile_path":"/mVhB7jztj07sTV5NgU84qyZXTrW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"664792a33f44dc5e3778779d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Fagerudd","original_name":"Johan Fagerudd","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/qCksgOKY057eWVbS4O68ve87E7F.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"664792acfe57646ee863037b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":234908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasmine Garbi","original_name":"Yasmine Garbi","popularity":0.1443,"profile_path":"/c0ulgB8hp2AvGEkpborqm9zLF2g.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"664792b28ee7f81e2d922c00","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1915829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"EwaMaria Björkström-Roos","original_name":"Ewamaria Björkström-Roos","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"664792d1184a463172920ccd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2363316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Håkan Pieniowski","original_name":"Håkan Pieniowski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/gCElob31xLkU8kW7u39F7gx3Dgd.jpg","credit_id":"6647930ab7786825aa63031d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2363317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Astrid Ohlsén","original_name":"Astrid Ohlsén","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xVwLirA9sWmGA0TRUndXZNf2I8A.jpg","credit_id":"66479294e3aa523b96f64055","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2363317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Astrid Ohlsén","original_name":"Astrid Ohlsén","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xVwLirA9sWmGA0TRUndXZNf2I8A.jpg","credit_id":"6647928af02cee3d9e1d01cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0431101","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
