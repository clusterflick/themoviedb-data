After relentless bombing of the Spitfire factories in Southampton, the Germans were convinced they had halted the production of the Spitfires for good. But across the South of England, hidden in sheds, garages, back gardens, bedrooms, a bus depot, and even a hotel, a workforce of unskilled young girls, boys, women, elderly men, and a handful of engineers secretly built thousands of Spitfires to help win the war. Witnesses recount this never-before-told story of amazing achievement.","popularity":0.9967,"poster_path":"/iaUZrTju6LHyLgVAZXk2EtiUHh3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":229067,"logo_path":"/3FrHaHNqk18cOcv91kSwBOrgqbe.png","name":"Ethem Media","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Secret Spitfires","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":192922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Thornley","original_name":"Paul Thornley","popularity":0.2147,"profile_path":"/zFrloO5FRGUSXRlOS6r2TvFdDoJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"66457b303f44dc5e37782bce","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4717205,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Roberts","original_name":"Gary Roberts","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66457b807305bf48af9e8987","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1473992,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stuart Roslyn","original_name":"Stuart Roslyn","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66457b4a8cd8de4dba1ca619","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4717213,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ethem Cetintas","original_name":"Ethem Cetintas","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66457cf0d05a769bb89e8a11","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4717213,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ethem Cetintas","original_name":"Ethem Cetintas","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66457ce4f02cee3d9e1ca7e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Howman","original_name":"Karl Howman","popularity":0.197,"profile_path":"/oSmEQDITOVrB5VRremET6Uv5G8o.jpg","credit_id":"66457cfc3f44dc5e37782cd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6303380","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"SecretSpitfires","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Z0lvujGUAfhJnwQpLu0diHzkf3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.468,"height":346,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oEY694KZKeQxWnhYuODBoEyfsXZ.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":854}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1744,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iaUZrTju6LHyLgVAZXk2EtiUHh3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1162},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2078,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jdewPGj7zZ9UOkc6p05MT4CzPcm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1386}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":10168,"name":"aviation"},{"id":251579,"name":"royal air force"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Director's Cut","release_date":"2018-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD - Director's Cut","release_date":"2018-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Channel 5","release_date":"2023-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Secret Spitfires Cinema Trailer 2mins","key":"GiE_N5qdbZg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-05-07T11:11:02.000Z","id":"664568500475358ff95c01ea"}]}}}
