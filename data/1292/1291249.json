One of them dominates the conversation as the other silently listens. As we learn about their stories, their joys and sorrows, tension slowly escalates between the young women, until the truth comes out in the end. Who has the upper hand in this female friendship? Adapted from Swedish playwright August STRINDBERG’s 1889 one-act play The Stronger (Den starkare), the short explores the age-old theme of female agency in contemporary Taiwan, accompanied by Valentine vignettes of the other young people in the cafe.","popularity":0.0777,"poster_path":"/9DV34LHSmFZCW9KaWahRPt9E41H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chang Tso-chi Film Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2023-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Valentine’s","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4717526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yile Lee","original_name":"Yile Lee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6645da2c1d9108f7271be782","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4445203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Szu-Chu Wu","original_name":"Si-Zhu Wu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7R57odiKFgiziTVaIXg1eHVnUFb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6645da8f7d2bc9308b1be76d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4717526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yile Lee","original_name":"Yile Lee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6645daa12319669d9c91da79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4717526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yile Lee","original_name":"Yile Lee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6645daa7a254a55496bd6d38","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Tso-chi","original_name":"Chang Tso-chi","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/oHNRoqpUboRPUfiKNf4anrCvJgg.jpg","credit_id":"664604dcf02cee3d9e1cb5b2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9DV34LHSmFZCW9KaWahRPt9E41H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1350}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
