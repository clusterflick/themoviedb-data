From the seed to the product, the cacao is the narrative thread that takes us through the Community's stories of violence and resilience, and their fight to remain neutral in the face of the Colombian armed conflict. This film offers a panorama of hope, proof that despite great difficulties it is possible to sow peace through human and economic relationships. It invites us to rethink our relationship with food, to value the efforts of those who produce it, and to build bridges between the victims of the armed conflict and other sectors of global civil society.","popularity":0.3435,"poster_path":"/qEMpFwg7CqZVhfOnf9XSLPOyhza.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chocolate of Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4718005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Mejia Trujillo","original_name":"Pablo Mejia Trujillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66462a9330016f7c5b3af66c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4718004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gwen Burnyeat","original_name":"Gwen Burnyeat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66462a81fbddf970f1eeda30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9838392","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":762,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qEMpFwg7CqZVhfOnf9XSLPOyhza.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5890,"name":"community"},{"id":11933,"name":"conflict"},{"id":182281,"name":"farming"},{"id":285275,"name":"colombia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
