All four knew each other, were regulars in the contemporary artist circles of Paris and, above all, shared a common fate: they were talented women in a world ruled by men. The documentary by Rudij Bergmann, an expert on impressionalism, which was filmed in France and the United States tells the story of the four women, placing their works at the centre of reflection on aesthetic, historical but also social matters. Set against the backdrop of Paris in the late 19th century, it reveals a new dimension of this fascinating and revolutionary period of art.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/neqXVq4M6GjbDwM2mc4Rjy5Mnkc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women of the Impressionist Movement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudij Bergmann","original_name":"Rudij Bergmann","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66475d29e68b7c68cb787788","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32389681","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/neqXVq4M6GjbDwM2mc4Rjy5Mnkc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
