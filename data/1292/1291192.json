Falsely claiming that her mother is American, she gains favour with the CHUNG’s, a middle-class family where she works as a tutor, thereby improving her career prospects. However, Carmen’s carefully constructed world shatters when she stumbles upon her employer’s secret, and she is forced to re-examine herself and confront her own identity. Through this poignant story about the Filipino diaspora in Hong Kong, the short explores a wide range of issues surrounding race and class in contemporary Hong Kong society.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/mn99JCEYznXfm7WwwLekoHjEYLb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2024-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adrift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4717313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabrina Man","original_name":"Sabrina Man","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66459b512319669d9c91d7a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2355365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fonnie Ng","original_name":"吳鳳鳴","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66459bbe01b10f96b982ce0b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4717312,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lam Wai In","original_name":"Lam Wai In","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66459af8bdc886da48bd6b81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4717312,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lam Wai In","original_name":"Lam Wai In","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66459b0764e340818f782fed","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mn99JCEYznXfm7WwwLekoHjEYLb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
