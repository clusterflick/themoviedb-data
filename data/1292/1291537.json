Saeki, who lives cunningly, schemes to oust the increasingly disliked Ryuji. However, his plot reaches the ears of the Daido-gumi boss, leading to his expulsion, and Fujinami, Ryuji's former junior, also leaves the organization.  In Saeki's place, Nagatomo becomes the new Wakagashira, and Ryuji inherits Saeki’s territory. But soon, mysterious meth begins circulating in the area. Ryuji and Tatsuya send three gang members who had joined the territory as Tatsuya’s juniors to investigate the source of the drugs. The shadow of Saeki looms large... Could Fujinami be involved too?  A new conflict erupts! The struggle between a yakuza forced into a corner and one who defends his honor intensifies. Will the brutal, chaotic killing spree that shakes the yakuza world ever end? Ryuji, to settle his own score, fires a sorrowful bullet.","popularity":1.1518,"poster_path":"/iVgrGbL6GLseUgLVfDEQ7NLvyid.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gokudo Ryuji PART2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riki Takeuchi","original_name":"竹内力","popularity":0.8145,"profile_path":"/qkCuwootNhUjRrGpl9V4UmUkyRL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6646978aad08a305073d74bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshiyuki Yamaguchi","original_name":"山口祥行","popularity":0.4173,"profile_path":"/jAaHxP854jQzsqRhx6vCQ05hwHc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6646979d3866fbb2d141062b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":80792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mihiro","original_name":"みひろ","popularity":1.6762,"profile_path":"/1EH4u7KlMHuj2prXWqJ39cRRoH0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"664697c0fccec0ec3c3b010b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takashi Matsuyama","original_name":"松山鷹志","popularity":0.9254,"profile_path":"/fBufEEFKgnEirPWJoGOpnJsZUjn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"664697c95f2ecfc56b410640","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1564426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sion Nakamaru","original_name":"中丸シオン","popularity":0.276,"profile_path":"/aOpBUKcQdJix3xnae7NYYWI8yvU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"664697d6256e4cb6bf9670f2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yudai Ishiyama","original_name":"石山雄大","popularity":0.3555,"profile_path":"/FStvCyUtOqFJ8cGZSjD1YfAxWN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"664697e2b694f43b71b356c4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masahiro Sudo","original_name":"須藤雅宏","popularity":0.1699,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"664697ecfdb2174287eee0d3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hitoshi Ozawa","original_name":"小沢仁志","popularity":0.8392,"profile_path":"/m2mLrkCcttT2fgHBMfObbq6G0sw.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"664697f524159ce9d42dc682","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takeshi Miyasaka","original_name":"Takeshi Miyasaka","popularity":0.1483,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66469b5f243f2fd4193b03d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takeshi Miyasaka","original_name":"Takeshi Miyasaka","popularity":0.1483,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66469b4d0d6cd6f50f2f0051","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1420,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/iVgrGbL6GLseUgLVfDEQ7NLvyid.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1001},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1420,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qf5E2VsErDhdBZjuhKIYsyzUf1x.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1005}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
