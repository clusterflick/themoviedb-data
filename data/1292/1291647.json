They then crossed paths with Ichi, a blind masseur and master swordman. However, upon recognizing his blindness, they decided to leave without confrontation. The next day, a woman known to Ichi and her samurai customer was found murdered at a brothel, leading to the wrongful apprehension of Ichi as the culprit. However, a few days later, when another couple was found murdered in a similar manner, Ichi was released. With his friend, they began their search for the real culprits.","popularity":0.2948,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1981-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sabu and Ichi's Detective Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae","type":"romaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomokazu Miura","original_name":"三浦友和","popularity":0.9632,"profile_path":"/2tKusMF6dzGOfH7MM73FCsJzRoJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66471675243f2fd4193b2e95","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatsuo Umemiya","original_name":"梅宮辰夫","popularity":0.6547,"profile_path":"/w5wodtODl7pMwNCaQNVkBh3YXBJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6647167b34617fd7ff345f10","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yûko Natori","original_name":"名取裕子","popularity":0.5275,"profile_path":"/2HpVR81BqoZeuz9EJGZyzvnZATy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"664716810d6cd6f50f2f32d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junzaburō Ban","original_name":"伴淳三郎","popularity":0.3664,"profile_path":"/qcJmLs8THtLqH8sjfeCW79Q274x.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6647168c96babcca25e08bb3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takeo Chii","original_name":"地井武男","popularity":0.4514,"profile_path":"/rwzis7FQC0LDgzWkKhkJy9aF4wr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6647168f781c4b29fb7878b8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuyoshi Yoshikawa","original_name":"吉川一義","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664716b33f44dc5e3778712f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32134924","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ccx9CtSeDkX8GXgo1UR2DBkTAGz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":186753,"name":"jidaigeki"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1981-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
