A child who grew up in Baraam, where there was a firearm called 'Jeomrye', had two or three affairs with Mr. Jang, a boatman from Gwiraecheon, at the time of the signing of the pre-war agreement at the end of the Korean War. , Unable to control his burning passion, he suddenly leaves for a foreign country, and as if he had done the double-take of selling his body to American soldiers, he gave the brown-haired mixed-race boy to Buddhist monk Baraam Beopdam and left, leaving behind a message that he would definitely come back to find him.","popularity":0.3144,"poster_path":"/kQpjYdAvqyiW7s5BJU2AtWypkzn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154810,"logo_path":"/ptFmUmvS7aANRcmajNW249FGPMu.png","name":"KBS","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South
