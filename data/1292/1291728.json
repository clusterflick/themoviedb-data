In digital video format, the film works with the “poor image” and is constructed through the documented archive of a real week, where the camera appears as another character, a machinic-sensitive extension of the protagonist himself. Ian constructs landscapes (sonorous and visual) to document the residual dissociative experience of his relationship with various drugs throughout a period of his life. The film M-HOLE constitutes both a therapeutic and documentary attempt to expose, through the archive, the aesthetic experiences that follow him during a week of his life. This experimental-documentary film addresses the issues faced by youth in confronting precarity and chemical policies in relation to the pathological avalanche of our times.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/dDkFhxRkhYVYJ8ZBrpGHzTjn3hF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"M-HOLE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4719686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junnio","original_name":"Junnio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Junnio","credit_id":"66476665a0f7144e44921888","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4620234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian
