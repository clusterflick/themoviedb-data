It's one of the few sounds you could hear in taiga, but recently there's almost nothing but silence. Within the last few weeks, Dimitri and Tatiana, elderly herdsmen, have lost their entire herd. What to do in taiga without it? Especially if you are very last herdsmen in the area. Everybody else already has left life in the forest for the nearby Russian village. This is the story of the decline of a small Siberian community.
