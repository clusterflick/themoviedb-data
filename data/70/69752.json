Declared “too fast to race” at the end of the 1986 season, the Group B cars changed the face of rallying! The Lancia Delta S4 could accelerate from 0-100km/h in 2-3 seconds on a gravel road, and Nigel Mansell is reputed to have said that the Peugeot 205 T16 could out-accelerate his F1 car! All were built to reach at least 400bhp, so we pushed these super-charged beasts to their absolute limit to see what else they could do, with legendary ex-World Rally champion Stig Blomqvist behind the wheel!","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/AdCoXILjCoeeqFgIcGaESF3heEe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Declared “too fast to race” at the end of the 1986 season, the Group B cars changed the face of rallying!","title":"Still Too Fast to Race","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Still Too Fast to Race - Group B Rally","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178860,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stig Blomqvist","original_name":"Stig Blomqvist","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47d9c3a368484e0dcf17","department":"Crew","job":"Driver"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AdCoXILjCoeeqFgIcGaESF3heEe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1kvbXJXbjmP2rbNp0ZrJxLzLUqK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1057}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
