Set against the breathtaking, azure vistas of the Greek Isles, the film merges a contemporary archeological “detective story” with some of the most advanced and painstaking digital re-creations ever undertaken for an IMAX® theatre film, with scenes that restore such centuries-old spectacles as the original Parthenon and the volcanic eruption that buried Santorini in 1646 BC.","popularity":0.639,"poster_path":"/41SrHY01jFrfAsASljSls45CVNe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2753,"logo_path":"/zlL22wCmcblgNo68WyFu6nYghKT.png","name":"MacGillivray Freeman Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3828,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canadian Museum of Civilization","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Come along on a great new adventure","title":"Greece: Secrets of the Past","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"IMAX - Greece: Secrets of the Past","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nia Vardalos","original_name":"Nia Vardalos","popularity":0.8188,"profile_path":"/vEsVp3bbVG72BBPJW3ciIcsUOX5.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"567cc438c3a36860e9002f26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":207394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christos Sourmelis","original_name":"Christos Sourmelis","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Younger Christos Doumas","credit_id":"52fe47c2c3a368484e0d802d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":556041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marissa Becker","original_name":"Marissa Becker","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Greek Painter's Model","credit_id":"52fe47c2c3a368484e0d8031","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":556042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dain Blanton","original_name":"Dain Blanton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47c2c3a368484e0d8035","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christos Doumas","original_name":"Christos Doumas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"567cc41d92514132db002e57","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Nikolakopoulou","original_name":"Irene Nikolakopoulou","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"567cc42a9251417de30054a4","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg MacGillivray","original_name":"Greg MacGillivray","popularity":0.1134,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47c2c3a368484e0d801d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":90225,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stephen Judson","original_name":"Stephen Judson","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47c2c3a368484e0d8023","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13719,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jon Boorstin","original_name":"Jon Boorstin","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47c2c3a368484e0d8029","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467609,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alec Lorimore","original_name":"Alec Lorimore","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567cc44e9251417dec0057f7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg MacGillivray","original_name":"Greg MacGillivray","popularity":0.1134,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567cc45bc3a3684c1d003235","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553386,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Georgette Alithinos","original_name":"Georgette Alithinos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567cc4679251417ddd005927","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553387,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dea Berberian","original_name":"Dea Berberian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567cc4749251417ddf0056c7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553388,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex G.
