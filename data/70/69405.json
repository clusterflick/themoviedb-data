When director, Risa Morimoto, learned that her beloved uncle had trained as a kamikaze pilot in his youth but carried that secret to his grave, she decided to retrace his footsteps and ask surviving pilots about their provocative experiences. Sixty years later, survivors in their eighties tell us about their training, their mindsets, their experiences in a kamikaze cockpit and what it meant to survive when thousands of their fellow pilots crashed to their deaths. Their stories insist we set aside our preconceptions to relive their all too human experiences with them. Ultimately, they help us question what responsibilities a government at war has to its soldiers and to its people.","popularity":0.0657,"poster_path":"/rzMTDyQsCgp0rVr7oZ8gxQQg3PY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Once, we were kamikaze.","title":"Wings of Defeat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"特攻","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Tokko","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Hoaglund","original_name":"Linda Hoaglund","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a32dc139549a012310884c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Hoaglund","original_name":"Linda Hoaglund","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a32dd4238513012e6297e2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1711077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Risa Morimoto","original_name":"Risa Morimoto","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a32ddae9c0dc0120a45359","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1711077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Risa Morimoto","original_name":"Risa Morimoto","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58308c2292514162c9013d71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0902259","wikidata_id":"Q8025288","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rzMTDyQsCgp0rVr7oZ8gxQQg3PY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":733}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
