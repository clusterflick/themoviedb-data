From the neon glow of Hollywood to the sun-drenched boardwalk of Venice Beach, fixed-gear has evolved into a vibrant street culture that is uniquely L.A. From director David Rowe (Fast Friday) comes a new documentary feature that explores a side of L.A. few outsiders have seen. From races through rush-hour traffic to midnight loft parties, To Live &amp; Ride in L.A. is a fast paced-trip through the busy streets and back-alleys of one of the world's largest cities. To Live &amp; Ride in L.A. features talented local riders tearing up the streets with first-time visitor Keo Curry (Fast Friday, Macaframa) - one of the living legends of the sport. Bike to hidden spots off the map, race a midnight alley-cat, keep pace with the riders from Wolfpack, and hang with the local crews, graffiti artists and other L.A. personalities burning up the fixed-gear scene.","popularity":0.4066,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Live & Ride in L.A.","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":900992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keo Curry","original_name":"Keo Curry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Keo","credit_id":"52fe47c8c3a368484e0d9425","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Gregor","original_name":"George Gregor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"George","credit_id":"52fe47c8c3a368484e0d9429","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":900994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hernan Montenegro","original_name":"Hernan Montenegro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lil' Hern","credit_id":"52fe47c8c3a368484e0d942d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mr. Quick","original_name":"Mr. Quick","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mr. Quick","credit_id":"52fe47c8c3a368484e0d9431","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyle Kelley","original_name":"Kyle Kelley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Trackosaurus Rex (as Tracko)","credit_id":"52fe47c8c3a368484e0d9435","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ace Carretero","original_name":"Ace Carretero","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ace Boogie","credit_id":"52fe47c8c3a368484e0d9439","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":900998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Efrem Yohannes","original_name":"Efrem Yohannes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Efrem","credit_id":"52fe47c8c3a368484e0d943d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":612477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Rowe","original_name":"David Rowe","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47c8c3a368484e0d9421","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1729669","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":966,"name":"beach"},{"id":3797,"name":"bicycle"},{"id":13088,"name":"summer"},{"id":154948,"name":"fixed gear bike"},{"id":154949,"name":"bike riding"},{"id":154950,"name":"venice beach, california"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
