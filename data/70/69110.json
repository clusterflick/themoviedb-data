She shoplifts and has an apartment full of things she doesn't need. Nick Ruiz is a department store loss prevention specialist who dislikes his job. He needs some fast cash to start his own private security business. One day Emily enters a department store and her compulsion to steal sets her in motion. Nick catches her on tape and instead of arresting her, he becomes intrigued and pursues her. After the two have become involved, Nick forces Emily to use her unique talent to bail him out of a bad situation. The outcome results in a climactic turn of events where justice plays its hand.","popularity":1.7756,"poster_path":"/9CJYpLNPXWNRPb4O16QnvbnnYnq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nucleus Films Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Klepto","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":181892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meredith Bishop","original_name":"Meredith Bishop","popularity":0.2356,"profile_path":"/Ybo3ngiv9kKDBIxlXfoeQWnnjO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Emily","credit_id":"52fe47b9c3a368484e0d6489","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jsu Garcia","original_name":"Jsu Garcia","popularity":0.5104,"profile_path":"/fXbhpqgxV5a2mnZykuwxc6ecGyF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nick","credit_id":"52fe47b9c3a368484e0d648d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leigh Taylor-Young","original_name":"Leigh Taylor-Young","popularity":0.4079,"profile_path":"/9l8TSUQQsTGx8aQMGurIf9gdTPY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Teresa","credit_id":"52fe47b9c3a368484e0d6491","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Czerny","original_name":"Henry Czerny","popularity":1.0061,"profile_path":"/zOWZzRmliKf9032IOOq0a3jXhVv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ivan","credit_id":"52fe47b9c3a368484e0d6495","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Nouri","original_name":"Michael Nouri","popularity":1.2405,"profile_path":"/4fqIgEp0REKkAzif9ZWPOTJrIRc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Cohn","credit_id":"5e3de8ba43250f0013cae032","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Irby","original_name":"Michael Irby","popularity":0.7389,"profile_path":"/9cX8pKujyAlOyqGSAgvKNdA3qRj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Marco","credit_id":"5e3de8c89603310019ea7c06","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirk B.R.
