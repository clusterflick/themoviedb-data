In the microscopic communities of Arctic Alaska there is no anonymity -- the hunter knows both the victim and the murderer. The murderer, claiming self-defense and desperate to avoid punishment, tries to persuade his friend to forget what he has seen, and help dispose of the body. The hunter is forced to navigate the uneasy morality of honoring the body and memory of one friend and destroying the life of another.","popularity":0.1693,"poster_path":"/rVQZ3mWXX5NEi6wm8FOVBM5bHgv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Inupiaq","iso_639_1":"ik","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sikumi (On the Ice)","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Weyiouanna","original_name":"Brad Weyiouanna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Apuna","credit_id":"601c60c51108a8003cc35c92","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Bryant","original_name":"Tony Bryant","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Miqu","credit_id":"601c60dad96c3c003f191f2f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olemaun Rexford","original_name":"Olemaun Rexford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Taqi","credit_id":"601c612757530e003f4592b0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1055199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Okpeaha MacLean","original_name":"Andrew Okpeaha MacLean","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53186a2892514177b4000fe1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cary Joji Fukunaga","original_name":"Cary Joji Fukunaga","popularity":0.4064,"profile_path":"/qhrtYCUM2NEaqVP3oB7vqkOTpx0.jpg","credit_id":"539032c50e0a262976001e65","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":928072,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cara Marcous","original_name":"Cara Marcous","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601c6166cf62cd003e06c6b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1399122,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gene Radzik","original_name":"Gene Radzik","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601c61c881a7fc0041022add","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1596819,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bob Edwards","original_name":"Bob Edwards","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601c6196470ead003e7680f0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Meyer","original_name":"Rob Meyer","popularity":0.1029,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601c61b0e38bd8003f48c0ae","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1152712","wikidata_id":"Q72881731","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rVQZ3mWXX5NEi6wm8FOVBM5bHgv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6uynBDxoKVqyFrAl0nbigts3XgH.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Sundance)","release_date":"2008-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fantastic Fest","release_date":"2023-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
