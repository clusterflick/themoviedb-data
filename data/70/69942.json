They quickly discover that they are sealed in, with only one way to get out alive. They must travel deeper into the underground facility to an escape tunnel that leads to the surface. Hindered by the fact there is only limited electrical power, they struggle through the darkness where they uncover a hive of genetically mutated creatures that stalk them from the shadows. Bred for combat, these monsters are endowed with razor sharp talons and rows of jagged teeth capable of ripping a man apart. While avoiding danger at every turn, they begin to regain their memories, discovering the origin of the deadly creatures and the part they played in their creation.","popularity":0.4868,"poster_path":"/9PsBExGWGeiVnZbtTbUGyS1QXCR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shadow Walkers","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Coviello","original_name":"Jason Coviello","popularity":0.239,"profile_path":"/nkD5pJjnMABNohzbv5lIfXtol53.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Reeve","credit_id":"52fe47e3c3a368484e0def93","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":557596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Summers","original_name":"Jennifer Summers","popularity":0.828,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"52fe47e3c3a368484e0def97","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clay Adams","original_name":"Clay Adams","popularity":0.233,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Clay","credit_id":"52fe47e3c3a368484e0def9b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cortni Mullin","original_name":"Cortni Mullin","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Leiko","credit_id":"52fe47e3c3a368484e0def9f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":557599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Gibel","original_name":"Rebecca Gibel","popularity":0.1945,"profile_path":"/bfRKCKebQWp9eSpQv7k3UPgCGzy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Emily","credit_id":"52fe47e3c3a368484e0defa3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Bocian","original_name":"Joe Bocian","popularity":0.27,"profile_path":"/7sL3zB0DE4MJNLBj8K5uLJzFKpD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Pierson (as Joseph McCambridge)","credit_id":"52fe47e3c3a368484e0defa7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":557601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tierza Scaccia","original_name":"Tierza Scaccia","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Serena","credit_id":"52fe47e3c3a368484e0defab","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trygve Lode","original_name":"Trygve Lode","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Primary Shadow Walker","credit_id":"52fe47e3c3a368484e0defaf","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185285,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jeff Pointer","original_name":"Jeff Pointer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613e88afefca00002d07520f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1411581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Steven Grove","original_name":"Mark Steven Grove","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/3a1qXKX80CL6uj2skCGm6zrkQ4G.jpg","credit_id":"613e8886d236e600672163d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232472,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dave Hodel","original_name":"Dave Hodel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613e88940cd32a0062b94a3b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0466978","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9PsBExGWGeiVnZbtTbUGyS1QXCR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/BqqnX8xGypHdChcYvRh0qBY9PN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8WQ8og5JcLsM52XztLax3aBCRM1.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
