This changes forever when a demon murders his girlfriend and destroys half of his sleepy college campus. Fleeing with Gabriel, the sole surviving member of a celestial team of demon hunters, Chris finds himself immersed in a world of supernatural terrorsâ€”a world populated by time-traveling gunslingers, coniferous bounty hunters, and the very demon who killed his friends.
