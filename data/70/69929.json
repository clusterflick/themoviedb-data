When Mickey Lewis, a homeless struggling artist crosses paths with Katrina, the beautiful rich wife of Arthur Webb and is enlisted to paint their home, deadly passions ignite. Soon hidden agendas, dangerous seductions, double and triple-crosses spiral Mickey's life out of control leading to a motel in the middle of nowhere filled with strange people and twisted secrets that all hold the key to the mystery of Mickey's past, present, and future. All it takes is - ONE IN THE GUN.","popularity":0.8671,"poster_path":"/2wBezCEtqJmOJEXbHY84gXwl4Rp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One of us is gonna' get lucky.","title":"One in the Gun","video":false,"vote_average":3.143,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"1 in the Gun","type":"poster"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":220386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Man","original_name":"Steven Man","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mickey Lewis","credit_id":"52fe47e2c3a368484e0dec8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":557545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Randolph","original_name":"Katherine Randolph","popularity":0.2185,"profile_path":"/gZrVRLrRl7VUyQBhiCLpmdQ5OjH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Katrina Webb","credit_id":"52fe47e2c3a368484e0dec8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Bauer","original_name":"Steven Bauer","popularity":1.4172,"profile_path":"/bdBfcd6cFKYPdWfeJ6X7tCpuKfu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Arthur","credit_id":"52fe47e2c3a368484e0dec93","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":103740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen W.
