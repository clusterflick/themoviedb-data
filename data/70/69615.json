He submerges himself in the office and eats sambhar rice at home and she never misses a bhajan at the temple and shops at Indian stores. They have a daughter Rithika (Akshaya Dinesh), 5 years old, the apple of their lives (their car's registration number carries the name of their daughter.) They have just settled down in a new, spacious home about which Malini, understandably, has fears. The couple squabble amicably about everything from her perpetual laundry and cooking; while Senthil argues with friends about the significance of viboothi (holy ash, usually applied on forehead) and takes his family on weekend trips and birthday parties. It is a normal, happy life in the US until Robertson (John Shea) arrives, to paint the basement. Now, things are never the same at home again.","popularity":0.3838,"poster_path":"/uqnXdaZZwUKXCVJc3YkI5OMmj2e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2009-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Achchamundu Achchamundu","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Acchamundu Acchamundu","type":"Tamil"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prasanna","original_name":"Prasanna","popularity":0.247,"profile_path":"/rOJIiOmeEhWGEZWDEyMTWS1KmWv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Senthil Kumar","credit_id":"52fe47d1c3a368484e0db2c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sneha","original_name":"Sneha","popularity":0.6681,"profile_path":"/cCfLk43SbEcx1lAzja037wKTzAs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Malini Kumar","credit_id":"52fe47d1c3a368484e0db2c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Shea","original_name":"John Shea","popularity":0.4623,"profile_path":"/hw8bJ85kNBx0cz5Ml2X5vqMP7bu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Theodore Robertson","credit_id":"52fe47d1c3a368484e0db2cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Stolzenberg","original_name":"Mark Stolzenberg","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":"/dQu8HV0ZRTzWNSrmRsl29mvvbk5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Clown","credit_id":"52fe47d1c3a368484e0db2cf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1064936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Harrison","original_name":"Andrea Harrison","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/edSqiCd4hhfhoDIwpmaaJxz4Ur7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Reporter Emily Barker","credit_id":"52fe47d1c3a368484e0db2d3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1625695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dheepa Ramanujam","original_name":"Dheepa Ramanujam","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/wnjAFAKT629yRNLD1Wya7B8wFcL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Malini's Friend","credit_id":"5d5287c56f974600149c086f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2976117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Carter","original_name":"Kim Carter","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Karate Student","credit_id":"60279c2221621b003ee5d32d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1064938,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arun Vaidyanathan","original_name":"Arun Vaidyanathan","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47d1c3a368484e0db2d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1064938,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arun Vaidyanathan","original_name":"Arun Vaidyanathan","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"532c2ed6c3a3684bb80014fd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1213631","wikidata_id":"Q4673581","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":738,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Ot7jFQjcrWRf7LFUAmygoPreGn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1312}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uqnXdaZZwUKXCVJc3YkI5OMmj2e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
