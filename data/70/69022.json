Accidentally he finds a cinematography archive which makes him advance a completely new theory on the reasons why humans became bipedal. Yufit proceeds with the plot by describing a scientist struggling against the epidemic wave of anomalies in the physical and mental world thematically started in his other films. This time the struggle takes place on the background of paleoanthropology, psychoanalysis and modern art. As materials of the Museum of Anthropology and other archives are included in the film, it oversteps the boundary between a feature film and documentary.","popularity":0.4424,"poster_path":"/gyDObvPbkCpeFe8tpreaAF0VPQt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93099,"logo_path":"/anZyUrl6OmCth1WhHGXbv6Oagd3.png","name":"Nikola
