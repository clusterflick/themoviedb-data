She was once a successful surgeon; her husband Arthur (Sanjiban), a brilliant scientist. But now, they exist in a world of emptiness and solitude, continuing the radical artificial intelligence research that Arthur had started a lifetime before. Before the accident. Now, after four years of ceaseless work, they've made a breakthrough, a discovery so great that it could change the face of science. But it will also require a sacrifice so great, that Magdalena's world will never be the same.","popularity":0.1408,"poster_path":"/3vGUP1z6DiZOQzeotsDSfpTiV1R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magdalena's Brain","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79580,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Anselmo","original_name":"David Anselmo","popularity":0.2775,"profile_path":"/gieOMDVqEtmUvYqZlTf4mBFq5Wz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Andrew","credit_id":"52fe47bac3a368484e0d6779","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":555775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanjiban Sellew","original_name":"Sanjiban Sellew","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Arthur","credit_id":"52fe47bac3a368484e0d677d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Shelton-White","original_name":"Amy Shelton-White","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/3hToG61RTwXCt5iqUra3fobCziF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Magdalena","credit_id":"52fe47bac3a368484e0d6781","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":555776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Weingartner","original_name":"Robert Weingartner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"52fe47bac3a368484e0d6785","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Konrad Rogowski","original_name":"Konrad Rogowski","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"559ff7c0925141407900038a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486013,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Warren Amerman","original_name":"Warren Amerman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559ff749925141408500048b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486013,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Warren Amerman","original_name":"Warren Amerman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559ff752c3a3680d4e00035d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1016296,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marty Langford","original_name":"Marty Langford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559ff762c3a3680d60000326","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1016296,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marty Langford","original_name":"Marty Langford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559ff7809251414080000324","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1016295,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Horgan","original_name":"David Horgan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559ff790c3a3685530000075","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486014,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joel Katon","original_name":"Joel Katon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559ff79d925141407e00037e","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0780561","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3vGUP1z6DiZOQzeotsDSfpTiV1R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
