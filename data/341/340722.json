The Jail Superintendent sends a helicopter to pick him to hang Billa, a man found guilty of killing 23 persons, and Shiva accordingly prepares his rope to carry out his unpleasant task. He returns home, ensures Ganesh finishes his school with honors, and then sends him to live with the Jail Superintendent and his daughter, Gauri, to study in college in order to become a police inspector. Shiva is informed that Ganesh has done well in his college examinations.
