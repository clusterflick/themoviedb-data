Such considerations are, of course, of only superficial importance: once producer and songwriter Jim Steinman had patented the Meat Loaf template on 1977's 30-million-selling Bat Out of Hell--an engagingly preposterous synthesis of Springsteen's Born to Run, Spector's Be My Baby, Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\",.  On the DVD: This DVD offers a choice of Dolby Surround Sound or PCM Stereo, and has a refreshingly simple and easy to navigate menu offering instant access to different tracks. The special features are desultory in the extreme: a brief biography of the Meat Loaf phenomenon and a discography.","popularity":0.7461,"poster_path":"/adMN3lSXyJeBR372dSJi5edj7bm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4375,"logo_path":"/eo8fJbkpiz9Wdsl1qDSEX4GXeZH.png","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rock and Roll, Meatloaf Style","title":"Meat Loaf - Hits out of Hell","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meat Loaf","original_name":"Meat Loaf","popularity":0.785,"profile_path":"/7gKLR1u46OB8WJ6m06LemNBCMx6.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"555c256d9251416b57000991","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1500735","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/adMN3lSXyJeBR372dSJi5edj7bm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":211514,"name":"pop rock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
