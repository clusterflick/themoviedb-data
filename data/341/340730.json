They arrive near Amritsar and take over the vacant house of Pervez Shahbudin - with it's lone occupant, a male child, left behind by his parents. Amrit gets to adopt him after Rajveer is unable to locate his parents, and they call him Ehsaan - who soon grows up to excel in studies and sports. On a trip to Kashmir, he meets with and falls in love with Chandni rather dramatically, and is overjoyed to learn that she also is from Amritsar.","popularity":0.4975,"poster_path":"/sd1K8s5NsYtIGJ74iHm81WXFuQU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Boundaries Divide...
