In their fight against the big boys, small town breweries enlisted television as their primary weapon. This wonderful video is a record of that historic battle, containing classic beer commercials like the Hamm's Bear, Bert &amp; Harry Piel, Mr. Magoo for Stag Beer, Mabel--Black Label, and dozens more.
