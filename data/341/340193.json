As the residents galvanise, the corporation sends in someone to 'shake them up'. The Horror of The Dolls features a strong ensemble cast, inter-twined narratives and an iconic piece of London architecture. The narrative is underpinned by the wealth divide, untouchable high-finance, malleable politicians and the resolve of a community under assault. All wrapped in a blood-soaked and stylised horror thriller set against the breath-taking cityscapes of contemporary London. The Horror of The Dolls is a terrifying, atmospheric and unpredictable journey. Influences on the project are The Shining, Blue Velvet, The Wild Bunch, Short Cuts and Antichrist.","popularity":0.2147,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Horror of The Dolls","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Allcorn","original_name":"Marie Allcorn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"5d920d1e79b3d4001f9149e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ava Barnett","original_name":"Ava Barnett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Blood Girl 1","credit_id":"5d920d39172d7f0027598625","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1247495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Brinkmann","original_name":"Richard Brinkmann","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Killer","credit_id":"5d920d49ec18790028d82554","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Chalkley","original_name":"Lucy Chalkley","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/dzU0mCe7vUVRxyUZcVgvjxdBHi3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"5d920d56ec18790020d7daab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Datblygu","original_name":"Sarah Datblygu","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"5d920d6466a7c3000f8da975","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Evans","original_name":"Jennifer Evans","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jenny","credit_id":"5d920d81172d7f00275986c8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Farmer","original_name":"Hannah Farmer","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Hannah","credit_id":"5d920d9179b3d4001f914b94","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1657776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shane Davey","original_name":"Shane Davey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5799e3c5c3a3680e88000929","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1634070","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
