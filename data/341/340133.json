His Jewish communist parents were members of the resistance. After the war he went with his mother to Poland, where he became a celebrated documentary maker of some 20 films. Prompted by his son Pawel, also a renowned documentarian, the pair embark on a road trip from Warsaw to Paris. Father and son point the camera at each other and themselves and take stock of one another. In the end, the two men each made their own film about this journey.","popularity":0.0913,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":158594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Łoziński
