We follow a group of four aimless, suburban teenagers - they skateboard the park, sleep in the sun, and rummage through the decaying remains completely unaware that this is where a lonesome teen is confronting a horrific past. Day turns to night, people disappear, and the secrets of Sunset Edge are revealed in a paralyzing finale.","popularity":0.0996,"poster_path":"/w2FZnvvFv1Q6TLyg25mM60fXfRO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Son of a Gun Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunset Edge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Dickerson","original_name":"William Dickerson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Will","credit_id":"61d3be241c09fb0041e8778a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Foltz","original_name":"Andy Foltz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Killer","credit_id":"61d3be370cd32a0068cdea94","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liliane Gillenwater","original_name":"Liliane Gillenwater","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dora May Moon","credit_id":"61d3be4a4284ea0065fe4f94","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Horn","original_name":"Jack Horn","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Pa","credit_id":"61d3be580cd32a001ccc2760","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob Kristian Ingle","original_name":"Jacob Kristian Ingle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jacob","credit_id":"61d3be74944a57006acb73cb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haley Ann McKnight","original_name":"Haley Ann McKnight","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Haley","credit_id":"61d3be834284ea001ca26015","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilberto Padilla","original_name":"Gilberto Padilla","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Malachi","credit_id":"61d3be90001bbd00432d0172","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blaine Edward Pugh","original_name":"Blaine Edward Pugh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Blaine","credit_id":"61d3be9f22f5d7008f764550","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":995331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Peddle","original_name":"Daniel Peddle","popularity":0.0767,"profile_path":"/nVErI1VTsFh9oUCGdRaKChqWN9k.jpg","credit_id":"55688d06925141466b001908","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":995331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Peddle","original_name":"Daniel Peddle","popularity":0.0767,"profile_path":"/nVErI1VTsFh9oUCGdRaKChqWN9k.jpg","credit_id":"61d3bd4c1b722c00412f092d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1851598,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karim L贸pez","original_name":"Karim L贸pez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d3bd674975600067a730e5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1851598,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karim L贸pez","original_name":"Karim L贸pez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d3bd724284ea001ca25c48","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3210282","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w2uZqzMPkee6Xv3lJTDPmoeoRtv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iZeOqQQYlo8sC8cUPIBZLTXWuoU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w2FZnvvFv1Q6TLyg25mM60fXfRO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sunset Edge (Trailer)","key":"qOG2IMLg628","published_at":"2015-05-05T03:56:17.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5566d808c3a368174f00141e"}]}}}
