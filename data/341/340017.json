The Alcohol Years is a poetic retrieval of that time, in which rediscovered friends and acquaintances recount tales of her drunken and promiscuous behavior.

it.","popularity":0.8217,"poster_path":"/5UbHZLYKDdiF3OFm4D6zmvreuRL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9262,"logo_path":"/zrvByJWJPsY5rJiZCVQZiHwnK0r.png","name":"Cannon and Morley
