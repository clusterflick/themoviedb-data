They both miss the tram home and walk together instead, ending up at Michael’s house where they discuss God and the world into the early hours. Following this encounter the two boys enter into an unusual friendship, united by their mutual desire to get away from the phoniness, the limitations and the restrictions of their parents and of society.","popularity":0.2957,"poster_path":"/8nWlh56xsaPBlmGCBW4qjK7sOps.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Banale Tage","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian Lukas","original_name":"Florian Lukas","popularity":0.198,"profile_path":"/cZ8ONguycVXYfZGLlAgrhLrjVWg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Michael Wagner","credit_id":"555a46e5c3a368778200d827","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Kuchenbuch","original_name":"Christian Kuchenbuch","popularity":0.152,"profile_path":"/3dmJrlWLLIKjtu95NoRkknJbytN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Thomas Torf","credit_id":"555a47059251416054000f22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Naumann","original_name":"Kurt Naumann","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/a9eyFIKuFYQh1hYrDlm7K7pKoYr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Peter Wagner","credit_id":"555a471092514141010009e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2308746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Mikityla","original_name":"Karin Mikityla","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/6GqpWeAgJAThELxm4fswZSDutBv.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Hanna Wagner","credit_id":"61fe3749ddd52d001b4f2596","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bärbel Bolle","original_name":"Bärbel Bolle","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Frau Torf","credit_id":"5b853f9c0e0a2645960560a2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst-Georg Schwill","original_name":"Ernst-Georg Schwill","popularity":0.257,"profile_path":"/ybCyYiDaFZ4mRHtWsQBageN4bSK.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Herr Torf","credit_id":"5b853f5dc3a368656005121e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1336076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jörg Panknin","original_name":"Jörg Panknin","popularity":0.1894,"profile_path":"/rGt77TsLizC3neYUSXZq4vsiSE4.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lehrmeister Vogler","credit_id":"5aab13939251413ff100801b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1001845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Astrid Meyerfeldt","original_name":"Astrid Meyerfeldt","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":"/ufMVOx7BAlYKZXl2zQCWL7PFSO1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Schuldirektorin Frau Boll","credit_id":"5a2feba5c3a3680b8d174db9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3413780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone Walter","original_name":"Simone Walter","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Karin Schulz","credit_id":"61fe37fe4b6d9d009803d963","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1861396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Herbst","original_name":"Anita Herbst","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Garderobiere","credit_id":"5d1ca75455b0c07f3b69f42f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1805714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Olschok","original_name":"Herbert Olschok","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/1AsvWnXPOHchzwHosZGvOjZj8Gc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a9b5162925141286d027882","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2220775,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ronald M.
