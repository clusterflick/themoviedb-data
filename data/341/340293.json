It shows that the \"magic seat\" of a movie theater can transport the movie-goer to all types of adventures, such as the Oklahoma land rush; being rescued by a sheik in the Sahara Desert; watching a huge ape climb the Empire State Building; or experiencing a hurricane in the south Pacific. No matter what type of thrill your looking for, you'll find it on the big screen.  Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in partnership with Library of Congress Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division in 2012.","popularity":0.3415,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":43330,"logo_path":null,"name":"Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Movies Are Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Mohr","original_name":"Gerald Mohr","popularity":0.4703,"profile_path":"/jJx5f6K7OkDD2LcHZTPtYYd4T97.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (uncredited)","credit_id":"55559f83c3a368777e001b1c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Cobb","original_name":"Edmund Cobb","popularity":0.2406,"profile_path":"/icnYHc5GwjZzl9wF2nLP8rPvL8a.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"George (uncredited)","credit_id":"55559f2ec3a3687782001e83","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warren Farlow","original_name":"Warren Farlow","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Little Boy (uncredited)","credit_id":"55559f489251411e5f001a5f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne A.
