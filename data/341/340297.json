Using her alter ego, Kelly Gabron, Smith fabricates a personal history of her emergence as an artist from white-male-dominated American history (and American film history). Smith collages images and bits of text from a scrapbook by 'Kelly Gabron' that had been completed before the film was begun, and provides female narration by 'Kelly Gabron' that, slowly but surely, makes itself felt over the male narration about Kelly Gabron (Chris Brown is the male voice). The film's barrage of image, text and voice is repeated twice, and is followed by a coda. That most viewers see the second presentation of the imagery differently from the original presentation demonstrates one problem with trusting any media representation.”  Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2016.","popularity":0.0549,"poster_path":"/wrN3RHyWFT3a7GibLg9hZQSQSCv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chronicles of a Lying Spirit (by Kelly Gabron)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1094393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cauleen Smith","original_name":"Cauleen Smith","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/6K3c26NOrykUvTeeG8WGXHRJIyE.jpg","credit_id":"5555a4d7c3a368776c001a83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0224763","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":860,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wrN3RHyWFT3a7GibLg9hZQSQSCv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":573}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":309397,"name":"preserved film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
