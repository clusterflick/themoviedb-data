'Smog Journeys' traces two families from two different backgrounds; one a mining family in Hebei province, and the other a trendy middle class family in Beijing. Both face a similar fate. Air pollution is one of China's most pressing environmental and health issues. Greenpeace calls for a shift from coal to clean renewable energy, as well as short term measures that better safeguard people's health.","popularity":0.5108,"poster_path":"/p63UarYLY0k6kNaflcWZTiLtUxR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46709,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greenpeace International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2015-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Clean Air Doesn't Come to Those Who Wait","title":"Smog Journeys","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhao Tao","original_name":"Zhao Tao","popularity":0.3496,"profile_path":"/dHcZ83DLBcWKxKHtVkTkBlS49fE.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"55576a5fc3a36877790059a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liang Jingdong","original_name":"Liang Jingdong","popularity":0.3543,"profile_path":"/d3KpBTePZwZxgYJ4y91FMo36IU2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"55576a71c3a368776a005ce1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1467697,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Liu Qiang","original_name":"Liu Qiang","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/w372wmyXDPPa29KVyIHT8vo76hc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55576a8c9251410225000357","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1523950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Lu","original_name":"刘陆","popularity":0.283,"profile_path":"/43UE4nftM6046WGMG88yfzFjpg8.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5623fa2092514171c500ecc4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181008,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zhang Yang","original_name":"Zhang Yang","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613ec76d006b01008de479cb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1467698,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Matthew Laclau","original_name":"Matthew Laclau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613ec7804cbe12002d676730","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25472,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lim Giong","original_name":"Lim Giong","popularity":0.1152,"profile_path":"/86K1ZzLANr8CtiyIEg2L4tkqwA4.jpg","credit_id":"613ec77691745b0091e84d6d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1467697,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Liu Qiang","original_name":"Liu Qiang","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/w372wmyXDPPa29KVyIHT8vo76hc.jpg","credit_id":"55576b139251411e51006279","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jia Zhangke","original_name":"Jia Zhangke","popularity":0.5362,"profile_path":"/oMWMIBAjyAscFe3xlqJ5Qugg6yS.jpg","credit_id":"55576ac39251412ff9004889","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jia Zhangke","original_name":"Jia Zhangke","popularity":0.5362,"profile_path":"/oMWMIBAjyAscFe3xlqJ5Qugg6yS.jpg","credit_id":"55576aad9251412ff9004886","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jia Zhangke","original_name":"Jia Zhangke","popularity":0.5362,"profile_path":"/oMWMIBAjyAscFe3xlqJ5Qugg6yS.jpg","credit_id":"55576a9c925141022500035e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25471,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nelson Yu Lik-wai","original_name":"Nelson Yu Lik-wai","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/ewJrzbA5YwL9EwRu98R7XrJwfYq.jpg","credit_id":"5893709ac3a3684a33000626","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4382154","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p63UarYLY0k6kNaflcWZTiLtUxR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":834}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6305,"name":"pollution"},{"id":187025,"name":"smog"},{"id":191652,"name":"greenpeace"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Smog Journeys: a short film by Jia Zhangke","key":"zfF7ZmKMUX0","published_at":"2015-01-22T04:04:26.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"55576bcfc3a36877790059bf"}]}}}
