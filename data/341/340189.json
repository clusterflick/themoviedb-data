After a break-up, they each experience their own rough patch. For David, a self-destructive artistic endeavor and a relationship with an immature beauty—for Brenda, a failing acting career, an eviction notice, and a boyfriend who just doesn’t do it for her. A chance encounter brings them together on the streets of New York at a particularly bad time. David invites Brenda to the opening of his first photography exhibit and the stage is set for a night of drinking and flirting which leads to an untraditional proposal of how they can be together without getting back together. A sharply observed, un-romantic comedy by writer/director Mel Rodriguez III, IN STEREO is a stylish and striking first feature that offers an unflinching look at the complexity of modern relationships.","popularity":0.4672,"poster_path":"/8gcxX3stp4UYEdY7ucB3XdDTJ4t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Stereo","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beau Garrett","original_name":"Beau Garrett","popularity":1.1551,"profile_path":"/vuslFsEffLIDskn5ikyrPvTby7x.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Brenda Schiffer","credit_id":"5556678e9251411ff000023e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1033252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aimee Mullins","original_name":"Aimee Mullins","popularity":0.2938,"profile_path":"/A4H8dBREovAels6YFAw8wrprE8R.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Trisha Bontecou","credit_id":"555667a69251411e5b003697","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1358986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maggie Geha","original_name":"Maggie Geha","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/zJyJ2ITVyeT8XukeON23X4cIhks.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Paula","credit_id":"555667d0c3a368777e003573","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Cantone","original_name":"Mario Cantone","popularity":0.6081,"profile_path":"/ZcWKRPvoOgPSn24M5eQD90FTST.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Resnick","credit_id":"555667e09251411e57003782","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micah A.
