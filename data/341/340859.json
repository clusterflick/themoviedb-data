Young actresses (and actors) try to incarnate the Swiss writer and traveler Annemarie Schwarzenbach (1908-1942). In order to get the role of this emblematic and sulfurous figure of the late 30's, child of the 'lost generation', antifascist and gay, this actors play scenes of her life, try to assume poses of hers from photos, and talk about their own life through the prism of her fascinating and ambiguous personality. A portrait arises, singular and multiple, public biography and intimate memory, drawn up by the woman of the past as well as by the young generation of 2014. Slowly, a reconstituted and collective figure emerges and encounters an own fictitious life.","popularity":0.1335,"poster_path":"/nGdqrBV6lG3EzjBeXLn6OLQVVBu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59460,"logo_path":"/bVx3FFeLnkV3jEuMcq5SRd0KBvm.png","name":"Paraíso Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2015-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Name Is Annemarie Schwarzenbach","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"My Name Is Annemarie Schwarzenbach","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1046043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Perazzini","original_name":"Julia Perazzini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c5fff22c3a3684d8d8dab66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Langensand","original_name":"Nina Langensand","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c6012bb925141338cbff329","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mégane Ferrat","original_name":"Mégane Ferrat","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c610fcb925141250af9c1a7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Leprince","original_name":"Pauline Leprince","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5c610fddc3a3684fa4d57b9b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2239750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentin Jean","original_name":"Valentin Jean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fEPDlBYXAFiRmNZAihAv8f7VFnj.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c610ff1c3a368745ed4f2a1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Ducamp","original_name":"Marion Ducamp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5c611026c3a3684f97d55582","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Véronique Aubouy","original_name":"Véronique Aubouy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"555b42f9c3a368777200f494","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Véronique Aubouy","original_name":"Véronique Aubouy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c38b46fc3a36826715d9022","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2052786,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hugues Gemignani","original_name":"Hugues Gemignani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c38b486c3a36826715d9038","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":64536,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Colette Beltran","original_name":"Colette Beltran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c38b4a49251412c801f3d7e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1940250,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rosalie Revoyre","original_name":"Rosalie Revoyre","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6010ae0e0a2638236b8023","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4426192","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nPOkSrPqdV8MlKQaFrzSl4KuDkx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/nGdqrBV6lG3EzjBeXLn6OLQVVBu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"18+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"18+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"My Name is Annemarie Schwarzenbach / Je suis Annemarie Schwarzenbach (2015) - Trailer English Subs","key":"P6GoS6BtBX4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2015-04-14T15:30:20.000Z","id":"66930ceb1339c1cda2873e4c"}]}}}
