The moon is shining. A static camera captures a huge flock of starlings searching the sky in circular movements… At first the starlings are hard to identify. Having deliberately edited frames coming from different generations of the original print in a certain metrical order, without changing the actual chronology of their movement, Kels has the constantly changing shapes of the birds dissolve in the rough grain of the celluloid. Once again a technical weakness of the celluloid forms the starting point of his visual enterprise. Shot on one reel without any interruption, the birds’ flight gradually forms configurations of astonishing beauty. —Millennium Film Journal, No. 30-31.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/AffMXfj3JCEptjB32AIzvPLYz4G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Starlings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl Kels","original_name":"Karl Kels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55560122c3a368776a0028f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl Kels","original_name":"Karl Kels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5556012a9251412ff9001394","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":857,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AffMXfj3JCEptjB32AIzvPLYz4G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":571}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
