Now that he has moved to London, as a more than worthy pendant, the BPO has released a compelling set of the Beethoven piano concertos from 2010 with Mitsuko Uchida, a cycle that possesses all the advantages of live performance with, as far as I can hear, none of the drawbacks.","popularity":0.2017,"poster_path":"/f7Xpl84f7N22tFY8iCWTCoqpVQl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ludwig van Beethoven","title":"Ludwig van Beethoven - Piano Concertos 1-5 - (Mitsuko Uchida, Berliner Philharmoniker)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f7Xpl84f7N22tFY8iCWTCoqpVQl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":207592,"name":"piano"},{"id":223778,"name":"ludwig van beethoven"},{"id":337056,"name":"berliner philharmoniker"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
