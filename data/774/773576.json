The basic idea: a collective, with security in authorship. Soon Ostkreuz became the most important photo agency in Germany. Now, they have 18 members from East and West.

His film tells the photographers' story with and without the Wall.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foto: Ostkreuz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2885079,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maik Reichert","original_name":"Maik Reichert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fce09abc0348b003e116999","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4859682","wikidata_id":"Q21540004","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"German\", \"english_name\"=>\"German\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"de\", \"native_name\"=>\"German\"}","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
