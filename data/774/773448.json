Clueless to the fact that a new decade has dawned - disco is out, a new club scene is in - he recruits his much-younger girlfriend, Kim Tiddy (The Bill) to help him keep up with the times. But both are thrown into a comical tale-spin when his estranged daughter Penny, Stephanie Webber (The Voice) unexpectedly moves in. Unlike the demure schoolgirl he remembers, Penny has a wild streak that rivals even her father's- -and a crush on an unsavory suitor to boot Shane Richie Jr. (The Nolans)! Now the cad must become the dad...but how will a badly behaved parent still stuck in the 80's keep his modern, free-spirited daughter in line?","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":"/tM9ZUE6ocucoEDaIG4qoSiB7l7s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Night a DJ Saved My Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5429982","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tM9ZUE6ocucoEDaIG4qoSiB7l7s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
