What experiential, political or aesthetic contingencies do we bring to both the making and viewing of a cinema that contains the human form? If a body is different from our own – in terms of gender, skin color, or age – do we frame it differently?  How does looking at a body on screen make us feel?  At CCA, New York filmmaker Lynne Sachs will guide her audience through her own evolution as a filmmaker by sharing excerpts from her own films.  In this way, she will explore the fraught and bewildering challenge of looking at the human form from behind the lens.","popularity":0.0942,"poster_path":"/2RXJN0Fg388qDEEwrsdA8NcJoFZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Body, Your Body, Our Bodies: Somatic Cinema at Home and in the World - an Expanded Cinema Screening and Talk by Lynne Sachs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1438516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynne Sachs","original_name":"Lynne Sachs","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/dFFx0RQimWEqBILDmZnNqwniJMt.jpg","credit_id":"5fcef4647314a10040d002c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2RXJN0Fg388qDEEwrsdA8NcJoFZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"My Body, Your Body, Our Bodies: Somatic Cinema at Home and in the World by Lynne Sachs","key":"398625682","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-18T20:00:42.000Z","id":"664f4b2a2bff5bec4182b6a9"}]}}}
