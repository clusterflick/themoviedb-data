This film features long audio/visual takes of settings in Brighton, UK; Plymouth, UK; London, UK; Windsor, Ontario; Toronto, Ontario; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Detroit, Michigan. In many cases, the shots seem to have the effect of functioning as “establishing shots”—suggesting that a story is about to unfold. But the viewer soon realizes that the story is inferred in the structure—and the narrative remains largely elusive.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/b5Q0KIahBBWjtdc6jPbSFwF5OXk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There for a While and Then Gone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2578534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher McNamara","original_name":"Christopher McNamara","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcd29647314a10040cd8eb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b5Q0KIahBBWjtdc6jPbSFwF5OXk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
