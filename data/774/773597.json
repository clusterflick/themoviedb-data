He decides to make a film about the psychotherapeutic treatment with LSD of a former concentration camp prisoner in the clinic of Bastiaans.  Patient Joop is arrested in September 1941 and begins a long hellish journey through various camps, until he is liberated by the Russians. When he returns to his wife, he has become a completely different man. Joop suffers from nightmares and is incapable of normal human contact. With two cameras, Van Gasteren records approximately six and a half hours of the first treatment that Joop undergoes with Bastiaans (four more will follow later). Special attention is paid to details: Joop's hands, the sweat on his forehead, a tear running slowly down his cheek. Van Gasteren reduces the recordings to more than an hour.","popularity":0.5418,"poster_path":"/hEpSkGuvMTW3VGVbfW0eoLHMz0Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Begrijpt u nu waarom ik huil?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3692968,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jos van Schoor","original_name":"Jos van Schoor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ac2e02e24b9300aee34622","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2209,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jan de Bont","original_name":"Jan de Bont","popularity":0.5957,"profile_path":"/evj9vN5pxxjr4aFLZRvniU0gzof.jpg","credit_id":"64ac2dcc43494f0120b31e09","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1474106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis van Gasteren","original_name":"Louis van Gasteren","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/vlQEikWPOQFRUq8ZDxLwGb5cfhR.jpg","credit_id":"5fce1845a5743d0042077aa2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13282986","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yGpvaL7qByMgT72noDeKuEPPreV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hEpSkGuvMTW3VGVbfW0eoLHMz0Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":2754,"name":"trauma"},{"id":40952,"name":"therapy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
