The body weight of a newborn child is up to 85 percent water, but in adulthood, the ratio can be cut into half. In a way, people dry up as they grow older. In Claudia Tosi’s documentary, people drink water, watch the rain and wait for their death. The Perfect Circle depicts a man and a woman, Ivano and Meris, who spend their final days at a hospice in the hills of Reggio Emilia, Northern Italy. Their illnesses are in the terminal stage and they know that death is only a matter of time. But the ever-nearing end may fleetingly be forgotten, like when they close their eyes and get lost in the music – until the bodies being carried out next door once again remind them of the inevitable. Death also becomes a part of life for the patients’ loved ones, who want to spend the last available moments with the soon to be departed.","popularity":0.7611,"poster_path":"/u2SOyTAZVbUb0qqiO1JqWbynf3i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145221,"logo_path":null,"name":"Movimenta","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":109096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Petra Pan Film Production","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":20961,"logo_path":null,"name":"Miafilm","origin_country":""},{"id":52190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cobos Films B.V.","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Perfect Circle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Perfect Circle","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2396700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Tosi","original_name":"Claudia Tosi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fce8b34a67254003f79354e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1601423,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vladimir Rakić","original_name":"Vladimir Rakić","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fce8b51680be800401d4446","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1601423,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vladimir Rakić","original_name":"Vladimir Rakić","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fce8ae7a67254004178f2af","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007663,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danniel Danniel","original_name":"Danniel Danniel","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/wPJAy83HUfX3xSm8wbxods2L1tq.jpg","credit_id":"5fce8b75fba62500407c5e61","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2396700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Tosi","original_name":"Claudia Tosi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fce8abe6c0e4f0041bd18f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2885735,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniele Rossi","original_name":"Daniele Rossi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fce8b0f6af8f8003d097f00","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2120936,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sylvia Stevens","original_name":"Sylvia Stevens","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fce8c2edc86470040191084","department":"Production","job":"Development Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1601423,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vladimir Rakić","original_name":"Vladimir Rakić","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fce8b1dfba625003d7c681e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1543315,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brand Ferro","original_name":"Brand Ferro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fce8ad996670e0040e9cb47","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2312136,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marco Duretti","original_name":"Marco Duretti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fce8af396670e0040e9cb69","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":17504,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roshanak Behesht Nedjad","original_name":"Roshanak Behesht Nedjad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fce8bff6c0e4f003ebcea52","department":"Production","job":"Development Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2396700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Tosi","original_name":"Claudia Tosi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff5f3c928723c0041afd090","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4402722","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"theperfectcircle.it","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u2SOyTAZVbUb0qqiO1JqWbynf3i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":131,"name":"italy"},{"id":1982,"name":"old people's nurse"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"},{"id":256853,"name":"hospice"},{"id":273916,"name":"palliative care"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
