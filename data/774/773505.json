Busted City is a visceral portrayal of the intense racial politics surrounding the election of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor. Theo is a bookie in a neighborhood tavern working with Jimbo, a retired Chicago cop. Al is their bag man and current Chicago cop. Johnny Jr. is Theo's brother, a gay man who operates the hot dog stand next door. Ace is the black mail carrier with numerous wagers from the Post Office, all betting on Harold Washington. The bitterly-contested election fractures the city along racial lines. Money, power and a familiar way of life hang in the balance as Busted City careens toward an explosive climax.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9lMTsXbXGZJ0VENXyExm1JxTaMK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Busted City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2884832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul L.
