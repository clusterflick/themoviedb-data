Now, amidst a global health crisis, the cruel weaponization of vote-by-mail restrictions has turned the constitutional right to vote into a choice between life and death.","popularity":0.3298,"poster_path":"/zAVICoc1HtArN3F2TtgKw3e8oHo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4971,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brave New Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suppressed 2020: The Fight to Vote","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Greenwald","original_name":"Robert Greenwald","popularity":0.2416,"profile_path":"/vV1tbnlZGFDgEBBhN7qShlD5ha9.jpg","credit_id":"5fccce62e32943003e3faa7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12835946","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oLMLUXTX5KVHqrW6jQPfllfD4pb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zAVICoc1HtArN3F2TtgKw3e8oHo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":226737,"name":"election fraud"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
