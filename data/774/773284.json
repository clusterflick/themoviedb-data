Yesterday, far away from home, the distance seemed to shape and re-signify my infancy and the memories arising from the Uruguayan worst economic crisis at the beginning of this century. Today, these words seem to prevail and the melancholy continues to invade. The second voice of the film belongs to Jorge Luis Batlle, ex-president of the Republic (2000-2005) during a visit to the United States.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/68mUMLczgACFRlci3wmBZJmxF04.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2020-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Induced Blindness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2884482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mauricio de León","original_name":"Mauricio de León","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Person I","credit_id":"5fcd3c7c43999b003d19c174","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2884483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafaella Varela","original_name":"Rafaella Varela","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Person II","credit_id":"5fcd3c996d97e6003cb9b6a9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2884414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucia Lopez","original_name":"Lucia Lopez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcd329495c0af0041a6c23b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/68mUMLczgACFRlci3wmBZJmxF04.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Analogica","release_date":"2020-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ceguera Inducida (Trailer)","key":"476061515","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-05T22:29:47.000Z","id":"5fcd3bb3a5743d0040087050"}]}}}
