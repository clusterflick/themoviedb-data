Bruce Campbell is the quintessential B-movie horror icon (and once appeared as Elvis in the soul-stealing mummy movie Bubba Ho-Tep).  Rob Kemp is not an icon as far as he knows, but he does love Elvis and horror, and has been told that he bears a passing resemblance to Bruce Campbell.  The Elvis Dead started as a throwaway comment in a comedy green room, and is the very definition of taking a joke too far.  So don your sequinned jumpsuit, strap a camera to a greased-up two-by-four and sing your way through as much of the plot of Evil Dead 2 as you can in an hour.  The cult hit of Edinburgh Fringe 2017, this multi-award-winning (and even multier-award-nominated) one-man-horror-comedy-mash-up was recorded for posterity as part of the fourth GoFasterStripe Festival and frankly, Rob couldn’t be happier about it.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/wG3qs8G0E6O5m5FCrEWkfaGf69b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33022,"logo_path":"/5d2uhejtffJP8vPgVeBH5jv0emd.png","name":"Go Faster Stripe","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The comedian’s inspired mashup of Evil Dead 2 and Elvis songs is much juicier than an ironic stunt.","title":"The Elvis Dead","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2520341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Kemp","original_name":"Rob Kemp","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fce49b27314a10040cefc4d","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nyteE9hISdWAhmGwxIpzWUs9FJa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":843,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rwT9WfceUXToJS8zuoStkjubu6w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wG3qs8G0E6O5m5FCrEWkfaGf69b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
