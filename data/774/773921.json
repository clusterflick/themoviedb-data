The intimacy of the conversation, the care of the makeup, the adjustments to the costumes… everything makes this film a precious and delicate portrait of a star. A quote by Piteco inspires the title of the short film, “this party is my life”, a phrase that reveals the ethical dimension of those who save themselves the whole year to surrender and brighten the D'Ajuda packages.","popularity":0.0708,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This party is my life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
