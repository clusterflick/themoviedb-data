Takis Kanellopoulos has now definitively exchanged history for myth (and its representation), and here he uses it as a bridge between past and present, finally mythologizing a city which, through his gaze, regains anew the characteristics of a rare Greekness, carved from Byzantine ghosts, ancient Greek outbursts, materials of soil and water that are stateless yet deeply rooted in a Greece that remains to be discovered.","popularity":0.0659,"poster_path":"/3aBM5syJAuZdS2IL1x5K3t0hHSG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1969-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kastoria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takis Kanellopoulos","original_name":"Τάκης Κανελλόπουλος","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":"/rQNS9AG4hgv5AqUDkU5NJLPhOTZ.jpg","credit_id":"5fce847c680be8003e1efb23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1112706","wikidata_id":"Q16326689","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":967,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3aBM5syJAuZdS2IL1x5K3t0hHSG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Greek\", \"english_name\"=>\"Greek\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"el\", \"native_name\"=>\"Greek\"}","note":"","release_date":"1969-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
