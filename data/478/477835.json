Chad, Jane, and the rest of the staff have no idea that the shop's former proprietor - serial killing baker, Desmond Bailey - is about to return to the scene of his original crimes. Deformed, enraged, and possessed by a malicious demon, Bailey is more dangerous than ever. It's up to Hank, the grizzled detective who ended the baker's first killing spree, to convince the staff of the imminent danger. Will they heed his warnings before it's too late, or suffer a delicious demise at the hands of the menacing murderer with a massive muffin for a head? The heat is on, the timer is set, and a new evil is on the rise!","popularity":0.1845,"poster_path":"/clPzcCLezAVqI2AqauBB3cKrlyn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dancing Monkey Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2006-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He's evil... and delicious!","title":"The Muffin Man","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Ippolito","original_name":"Chris Ippolito","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/9CxDzzgyiEcc31NHxfvONcAeFvN.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Chad","credit_id":"59c92b99925141453c01a028","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1894548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Shepherd","original_name":"Michael Shepherd","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":"/txi92rsRQ1XwWXIQ24ZsXpuHe0m.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Detective Hank Egger","credit_id":"59c92bec9251415b54074075","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allison Lynch","original_name":"Allison Lynch","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jane","credit_id":"59c92c04c3a368140307b240","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Ireland","original_name":"James Ireland","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Muffin Man","credit_id":"59c92c10c3a368140307b24f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Blaine Wasylkiw","original_name":"Blaine Wasylkiw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c92c1d9251415b5d073c1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894553,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anders J.
