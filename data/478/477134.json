As Roy will learn, sometimes finding the answer to one problem only brings about a host of others. Immediately after finding a drummer, Roy is plagued by a raging case of hemorrhoids. This causes his parents to be confused about his sexuality, and starts up all sorts of new rumors at school. In the most unexpected place, Roy meets his dream girl Samantha. As Roy and Sam's relationship develops, Witness My Jehovah lands their first big gig at a local music venue. When things don't go as planned, Roy is faced with some of the biggest decisions he'll ever have to make.","popularity":0.5629,"poster_path":"/qgTSjXkK0DS608ZLQ4irVa2MDQQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98963,"logo_path":null,"name":"Noteworthy Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A feature length coming of age story about high school love, punk rock, and hemorrhoids.","title":"The Backseat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1718798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Bellant","original_name":"Chris Bellant","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/zK0qKgB9RFu7TH5cM0PEtdEwU3s.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Roy Offerman","credit_id":"5a42a5ef0e0a264fb903f332","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allyson Reilly","original_name":"Allyson Reilly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"5a42a607c3a3685916040a70","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Kelly","original_name":"Craig Kelly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Larry DiMarco","credit_id":"5a42a6590e0a264f7703d248","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Costa Nicholas","original_name":"Costa Nicholas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mike Peterson","credit_id":"5a42a66a9251411fd5054d58","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André De Shields","original_name":"André De Shields","popularity":0.268,"profile_path":"/xpDTjfThQvT4aUW3SSnYM1u1MBs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Davies","credit_id":"5a42a6789251411fab057244","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lori Hamilton","original_name":"Lori Hamilton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Debra Offerman","credit_id":"5a42a69bc3a36858e403d101","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1897388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Thomas Cramer","original_name":"John Thomas Cramer","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/tV60v2WtFNOnHj83OURNIqv49xD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"David Offerman","credit_id":"5a42a6bcc3a368589003bc2a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1948436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenna Michno","original_name":"Jenna Michno","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/51URs3ZSlFjHnIcJ952dEdsUV9h.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kelly","credit_id":"5a42a6e2c3a36858e0041756","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3871536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Van Orden","original_name":"Matt Van Orden","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/wLXaxtyty4lgpPGmpYqlsNN5RWE.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mr. Hennrick","credit_id":"63c1e78917b5ef007d529cc3","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan O'Leary","original_name":"Ryan O'Leary","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a42a72dc3a3685916040d41","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan O'Leary","original_name":"Ryan O'Leary","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a42a71a9251411f51054608","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan O'Leary","original_name":"Ryan O'Leary","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a42a73c9251411fd5054f74","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan O'Leary","original_name":"Ryan O'Leary","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a42a70f925141740302f702","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2184956","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qgTSjXkK0DS608ZLQ4irVa2MDQQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
