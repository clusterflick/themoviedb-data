Nearly 100 radio amateurs volunteer every month to operate from the station. Since radio was reintroduced to the ship, W6RO has presented a positive image of the Amateur Radio Service to more than four million visitors.  Permanently docked at the Port of Long Beach, the Queen Mary is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Southern California. W6RO is a regular stop for visitors on the self-guided tour, and visiting radio amateurs may log in and get on the air.
