Lajma, a beautiful school teacher with greying hair, leaves Pakistan for her childhood home in India. There she discovers that the home is in ruin, her aging aunt is half senile, and her cousin Gautam  is bitter and defeated.  Flashback to 1947 when India splits in two - a proud old Muslim man, along with his grieving daughter-in-law, take in a couple of impoverished Hindus, Chand and Bhagwati, into their home. Later, Chand's mute sister Lajjo arrives with her young daughter Lajma. Suffering from some unnamed past trauma, Lajjo is eventually sent to an asylum, leaving Lajma with her uncle.  Lajma recalls her aborted relationship with the childhood friend and her inability to understand what her lover was going through, as well as her lover's inability to acknowledge a latent bisexuality. But the most difficult memory to deal with is that of her mother, brutalised during the riots.","popularity":0.2251,"poster_path":"/kFQFHEDxwvYV9wjoOaOvWKWf4v7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3883,"logo_path":null,"name":"JBA Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":113163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vital Films","origin_country":""},{"id":32413,"logo_path":"/jXHqu6xyG8l5mKwK66u5ahzYdfD.png","name":"National Film Development Corporation of India","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1999-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadows in the Dark","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Subrat Dutta","original_name":"Subrat Dutta","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":"/49hCbFpWI3g02l00ohKg3rSzxlg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"59c496b7c3a3681403023e3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kitu Gidwani","original_name":"Kitu Gidwani","popularity":0.2936,"profile_path":"/sEQ1TrUwCsYuy0IpDY7XAoj9Skd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"59c496c29251415b280231e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":987703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mandakini Goswami","original_name":"Mandakini Goswami","popularity":0.146,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59c496d1c3a3681454020df6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naseeruddin Shah","original_name":"Naseeruddin Shah","popularity":0.8801,"profile_path":"/lFvGfKypi5NNyUjrsT8Y7ebWc7G.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"59c496dd9251415b32021fb2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6508,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Loveleen Tandan","original_name":"Loveleen Tandan","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":"/u9cotUVIdSpLnIo43bZGaRwsxdt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"59c496e99251415b24023337","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pankaj Butalia","original_name":"Pankaj Butalia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c4968ac3a36813ed022e66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pankaj Butalia","original_name":"Pankaj Butalia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c326acb0e0a2663023d37ba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ranjan Palit","original_name":"Ranjan Palit","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/hGG6diFYa6mPYVq69PhtIAuPxBc.jpg","credit_id":"5c326ae3c3a3682915ac396b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1760072,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Indrajit Neogi","original_name":"Indrajit Neogi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c326aefc3a3680b8ca73e15","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240087,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacques Bidou","original_name":"Jacques Bidou","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/jkCiKK5XuripxBZVzhriAOVmeXN.jpg","credit_id":"5c326ad4c3a3680b8ca73dbe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0253177","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.58,"height":2873,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kFQFHEDxwvYV9wjoOaOvWKWf4v7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315129,"name":"bisexual men"},{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
