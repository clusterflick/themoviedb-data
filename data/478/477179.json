Dosunmu takes his cameras to Detroit's annual \"Hair Wars\" competition, in which stylists compete to see who can create the wildest and most outrageous hairdo. Offering a stark contrast between the unique aesthetic of the stylists and the grinding poverty of inner city Detroit, which never fully recovered from the 1968 riots, Hot Irons shows how events like \"Hair Wars\" brings a sense of art and purpose to a community where both are often lacking.","popularity":0.0908,"poster_path":"/tFglNASfYTxAoM3CXIMd9mbxhBI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hot Irons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Dosunmu","original_name":"Andrew Dosunmu","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":"/qNnfY9Ruk7H8EERHAYyeSifEo8t.jpg","credit_id":"59c49ae69251415b5d0222c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0211421","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tFglNASfYTxAoM3CXIMd9mbxhBI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1257,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kJIte8ck9GPh9sQYHPy4NljXhT9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":838}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Toronto International Film Festival","release_date":"1999-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
