Director Klaus Stanjek's cheerful Uncle Willi lived with his family, except when he was touring as a musician across Germany. Only when Willi turned 90 did his nephew Klaus Stanjek detect what his whole family had hidden: that Uncle Willi has spent eight years in Nazi camps and that he was gay. In a radical personal approach, veteran filmmaker Stanjek follows the complex turns that his family takes when they confront his Uncle Willi's secret. The result is a personal and political portrait of his beloved uncle, a talented singer and accordion player, that is one part historical inquiry and one part fascinating detective story.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/hehme3AETLqincFADlIEAUxvSoy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sounds from the Fog","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niels Bolbrinker","original_name":"Niels Bolbrinker","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/k3QJKcgl4kHbRF58b0Kp0Sx8uXZ.jpg","credit_id":"61ae0914202e11001cd9ccdd","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894050,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Klaus Stanjek","original_name":"Klaus Stanjek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c805bc9251415b6e05acbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894050,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Klaus Stanjek","original_name":"Klaus Stanjek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c805c59251415b6e05accf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2538022","wikidata_id":"Q47168457","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xJRjQL3uiftdhq7vd79YhOYpA38.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hehme3AETLqincFADlIEAUxvSoy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":911,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/HCwh6UBO9HDpoAeKQdBaZqCXh2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":645}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
