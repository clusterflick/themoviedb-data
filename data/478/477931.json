Using a laborious traditional system to mount the details of each image, this cinematic event gradually unfolds over the 72-minute film, offering a slow contemplative consideration of political violence as a counterpoint to the rapid barrage of images we typically experience in our news media. Despite its slow, nearly meditative pace, Baudelaire creates a haunting and provocative work that completely absorbs the viewer.","popularity":0.0739,"poster_path":"/wTB9nA3ZhnPEmXRzEyBmsREje7t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sugar Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Baudelaire","original_name":"Eric Baudelaire","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/w1VxVJbFm7fBT5ib9Z27zfDOM3E.jpg","credit_id":"59c98182c3a3684d85000433","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1598,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wTB9nA3ZhnPEmXRzEyBmsREje7t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
