Instead, she terrorizes any shop owner foolish enough to audition her labor. In a throwback to the third episode, where she apprentices for a milliner, Titine drops a carton of fancy hats that are crushed by a steamroller. Then she throws a cake at the baker’s best customer and insults a woman with large feet at the shoe store.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/gkfZmC0IfBlmWProskSg2pKmAto.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1911-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Léontine’s Apprenticeship","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Betty's Apprenticeship","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Betty Tries to Learn a Business","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Léontine apprenti-modiste","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1192066","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gkfZmC0IfBlmWProskSg2pKmAto.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n9pN0rzWjzRSAXynXfUoVBjaxiR.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xFRGO6ZxbCwz4NC4o9vKNAPwV1J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1911-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
