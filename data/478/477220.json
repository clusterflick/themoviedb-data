It focuses on presenting the day-to-day activities of labor in the main factories of the factory: modeling, foundry, steelworks and finishing. This documentary reflects not only the material processes, but also the rules, norms and values ​​that underlie the actions of men at work. In spite of the difficulties with filming in an industrial environment (risk of assimilation of the filmmaker to the employer's eye), the film testifies to the working relations that unite the workers around the manufacture of a piece of 60 tons steel in the particular context of a heavy metallurgical industry.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":95246,"logo_path":null,"name":"Editions Harmattan","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ouvriers de Tamaris","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Remillet","original_name":"Gilles Remillet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c4d8c5c3a3681461020e09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
