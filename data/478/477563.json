His incarceration has not lessened his craving for female society, but he finds his mistress false. A young girl, trying to sell vacuum-cleaners, calls at his home. Half-starved, she collapses. The blackleg’s heart is touched, and he befriends her. Gratitude on her side develops to love. Though she takes the place of the false one, she urges the man to marry her.

separated.","popularity":0.261,"poster_path":"/izXh8YHc3Fxih34GJgZ5aS5rWIe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1929-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No
