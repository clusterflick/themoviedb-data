In 2002 while shooting Caribs' Leap in Grenada, McQueen met and filmed a young man called Ashes, but the footage was not used. Many years later he learned that Ashes had been killed. McQueen decided to create a tribute to him, combining old and new footage. On one side of the screen, Ashes is full of life, his boat moving towards a seemingly unending horizon. The other side shows his tomb being constructed and the etching of a memorial plaque for his grave. Over the soundtrack, two local men tell the story of Ashes's untimely death.","popularity":0.1445,"poster_path":"/vDAqstx7CPVNKPvAM57s29YKjBs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ashes","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2567666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashes","original_name":"Ashes","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e6eb9eccabfe400131551ae","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve McQueen","original_name":"Steve McQueen","popularity":0.4663,"profile_path":"/if4tLIZJ0EJtyhlJaSzSwMQU5Yz.jpg","credit_id":"59c42a709251415b7701d39a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":999565,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joe Walker","original_name":"Joe Walker","popularity":0.3717,"profile_path":"/2pfPFxb2I0ulvMZx5B7juwvuU3I.jpg","credit_id":"5f42d48fe86017003456f81f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1632,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robby Müller","original_name":"Robby Müller","popularity":0.2708,"profile_path":"/1YeDTwdFQNxM6hDADl0bKfuX7Fx.jpg","credit_id":"5f42d4760bb0760032d80a17","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289914,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jessica de Koning","original_name":"Jessica de Koning","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42d48047721500336342e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4149768","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vDAqstx7CPVNKPvAM57s29YKjBs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4149768/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_rdat","release_date":"2014-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4149768/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_rdat","release_date":"2014-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
