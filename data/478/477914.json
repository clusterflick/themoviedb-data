At the time, a state-owned hydroelectric company, Kemijoki Oy, started harnessing the rivers of Lapland. When the company presented its plan to build the Vuotos reservoir, the area to be drowned was inhibited by 150 people including Veikko and Impi. Now they are alone. The fight over Vuotos reservoir has lasted over forty years. In 1982 the Finnish government decided that the reservoir wouldn't be built, but the company didn't give up. A decade later a new government decided that the company can apply Water Court for the permission to build the reservoir, and the fight was on again. Despite the long fight, Veikko and Impi haven't given up hope. They still love their home.","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":"/b0JDGs9qEBcLWRnZ2gmGzTkKHGl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228,"logo_path":"/zT2bcTDEbBkfZi2APB8DYJKLIQ3.png","name":"Filmpool Nord","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":155360,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magic Path Entertainment Oy","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2000-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before the Flood: The Last Couple in Vuotos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124281,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olli Soinio","original_name":"Olli Soinio","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":"/oCipY9mKt4JdaBGzgtXEeMWs7iD.jpg","credit_id":"60ba081f7cffda00406d0e95","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3113840,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Antti Väisänen","original_name":"Antti Väisänen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ba07fc18b75100419d16da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3109693,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olli Tuomainen","original_name":"Olli Tuomainen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ba080e7cffda0057f1bb36","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3000663,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vesa Taipaleenmäki","original_name":"Vesa Taipaleenmäki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ba0807ec8a430057f34954","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mika Ronkainen","original_name":"Mika Ronkainen","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/r9tH876dWEls3eq4LRchwL9lqDr.jpg","credit_id":"60ba07d718b75100296f3565","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mika Ronkainen","original_name":"Mika Ronkainen","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/r9tH876dWEls3eq4LRchwL9lqDr.jpg","credit_id":"60ba07cf65686e00299c7c43","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3113842,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Veikko Schroderus","original_name":"Veikko Schroderus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ba08178de0ae002bc1498a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1837052,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mikael Brodin","original_name":"Mikael Brodin","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ba0829cb9f4b006f30870d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mika Ronkainen","original_name":"Mika Ronkainen","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/r9tH876dWEls3eq4LRchwL9lqDr.jpg","credit_id":"59c976bfc3a36813ed07d168","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0308016","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b0JDGs9qEBcLWRnZ2gmGzTkKHGl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
