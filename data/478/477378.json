He looks for his accomplice, Dong-il, and his wife. Dong-il has cleaned up his old life, determined to start anew. Kam-bo goes to the racetracks to kill time. A hustler pickpockets Kam-bo but he is rendered helpless by Kam-bo's strength when he catches up with him. The two become friends. The hustler gives Kam-bo a watch. Unwittingly, Kam-bo becomes a suspect in a murder due to the watch. Kam-bo and the hustler stick their noses into the murder investigation as they try to find out where the stolen watch came from.
