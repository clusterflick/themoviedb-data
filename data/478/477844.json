It is a biography of a living place that continues to evolve as the city changes. The documentary explores its historic creation as the first truly public park, its psychological and sociological significance, artistic design, and role as an urban oasis as the world becomes increasingly aware of the importance of green spaces. The film celebrates nature’s seasonal changes with beautiful photography and original music that capture the “good vibes” of a park filled with New Yorkers at play. Home to birdwatchers, sunbathers, kids playing in the snow, musicians giving impromptu concerts and big events like Shakespeare in the Park and the New York City Marathon, Central Park is central to the life of the city. Central Park: The People’s Place examines both the collective and individual experiences of Central Park, rejoicing in the diversity and splendor of an American experiment in social democracy.","popularity":0.3129,"poster_path":"/lR8wzb6mD9UgnYYP1rv7c8vcfr3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Central Park: The People's Place","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lR8wzb6mD9UgnYYP1rv7c8vcfr3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"iTunes","release_date":"2017-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
