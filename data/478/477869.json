The sweeping narrative of Il Fiacre n. 13 was mutilated by the Italian censor’s suppression of its first part, the most cynical episode, which sets the scene for a scheme discernable in the other three episodes, as the story develops from a sordid murder through plotting and deceit to finally reach a happy ending.","popularity":0.078,"poster_path":"/4WV6RhoWW1rvvuPrwyN3S2lS9Nm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1917-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cab Number 13","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Capozzi","original_name":"Alberto Capozzi","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/zB9UAZebn9wqn8sfIaAQ5gqai4B.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0c7bff93db92003655e8be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2710928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Makowska","original_name":"Helena Makowska","popularity":0.1694,"profile_path":"/fcfeQsPvdlwd9Ed0p1D4X7IYi5j.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc1cc6e3a340b003edbd81a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gigetta Morano","original_name":"Gigetta Morano","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0c7c0befe37c0037cd6985","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1096872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernanda Negri Pouget","original_name":"Fernanda Negri Pouget","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0c7c1081c7be0035f8d680","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2710923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Bayma-Riva","original_name":"Mary Bayma-Riva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0c7c1a93db92003750e7bf","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Capozzi","original_name":"Alberto Capozzi","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/zB9UAZebn9wqn8sfIaAQ5gqai4B.jpg","credit_id":"59c95213c3a368144307ccf7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":399929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gero Zambuto","original_name":"Gero Zambuto","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/cGJgqSmj4ypIxUYGD9HSQhgoPv5.jpg","credit_id":"59c952209251415b54076713","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1391419,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giovanni Vitrotti","original_name":"Giovanni Vitrotti","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91af5dd9d9856e65c4f8b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367875,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Xavier de Montépin","original_name":"Xavier de Montépin","popularity":0.0893,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91b191575dd985adab247","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0173822","wikidata_id":"Q3793944","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4WV6RhoWW1rvvuPrwyN3S2lS9Nm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1917-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
