The action takes place in the 14th century and deals with the political and personal rivalry between the corsair Simon Boccanegra, who has been elected Doge of Genoa with the help of the plebeian vote, and the local nobleman, Jacopo Fiesco. Arthaus presents a visually alert, musically sensitive and disturbingly coherent (Der Standard) production of the piece on DVD. The staging was directed by one of the giants of the European theatre, Peter Stein. His fondness for atmospherically dense spaces in which the characters can fully develop is particularly well brought out in his Vienna production, not least because he had at his disposal two remarkable singing actors for the principal male roles, Thomas Hampson and Ferruccio Furlanetto.","popularity":0.1732,"poster_path":"/kaUBtrVoqeuwiQJgIZ7euGtEd1J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19492,"logo_path":null,"name":"ArtHaus","origin_country":""},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2002-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Simon Boccanegra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":460831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Hampson","original_name":"Thomas Hampson","popularity":0.2539,"profile_path":"/6DGBYLORYO3uKvJrWUCV2rNswbh.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Simon Boccanegra","credit_id":"59c5748f9251415b7703364d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1893193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Gallardo-Domas","original_name":"Cristina Gallardo-Domas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Maria Boccanegra","credit_id":"59c574b59251415b5d030524","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferruccio Furlanetto","original_name":"Ferruccio Furlanetto","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/hbElzVd6o6BjwQQW3Nop4TlbDph.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jacopo Fiesco","credit_id":"59c574e3c3a3681443032ca7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boaz Daniel","original_name":"Boaz Daniel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/47NyA9NebGZAr8UjlVff0eV2oiX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Paolo Albiani","credit_id":"59c5750f9251415b5403012f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Paul Dumitrescu","original_name":"Dan Paul Dumitrescu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pietra","credit_id":"59c575399251415b2803250a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2451100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miroslav Dvorský","original_name":"Miroslav Dvorský","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc34ab799259c00137a2f2d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniele Gatti","original_name":"Daniele Gatti","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":"/9tc0hUAeydU0oMpY6UlRnNEYOsG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5dc34afd7d5db500199bed53","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniele Gatti","original_name":"Daniele Gatti","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":"/9tc0hUAeydU0oMpY6UlRnNEYOsG.jpg","credit_id":"59c575829251415b32030eb4","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1567680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Stein","original_name":"Peter Stein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c575a0c3a368140303346e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"59c5754ac3a36813ed031f62","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Maria Piave","original_name":"Francesco Maria Piave","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc34b3e7d5db500199bedb0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2198185","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kaUBtrVoqeuwiQJgIZ7euGtEd1J.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1438,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dyeFY2JkGLebWGBfAGBgu6p7VNX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
