Built at the beginning of the century for a few privileged families, this sumptuous residence will become after the revolution a collective apartment building. Like millions of Russians, those who lived together in this building were marked by the trials and tragedies of history. Marina Goldovskaya went in search of the former inhabitants, now dispersed. They speak to us with modesty and emotion about their memories, their secret garden and... their neighbors at 35 Arbat Street.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/p8OF6N931RqOFgJaInflCbKDvWQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1993-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The House on Arbat Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"A HOUSE WITH KNIGHTS","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Goldovskaya","original_name":"Marina Goldovskaya","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/xCQuw54l9JsCpx5AjXNGPqGi8bZ.jpg","credit_id":"59c99051925141174b00020e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0216897","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p8OF6N931RqOFgJaInflCbKDvWQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
