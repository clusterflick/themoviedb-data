Flabbergasted, elderly choir director Mary Margaret (Sallie Wanchisn) leads the choir to boycott. Facing termination, Pastor John resorts to disguising himself as an old man to bridge the generation gap, win over Mary, and lead the choir back to the church. When he discovers that the wounds run deeper than he first suspected, Pastor John must learn to love the unlovable or risk the ruin of his church and family.","popularity":0.519,"poster_path":"/pguPZwTqdXfbv5S6zCRVwRUQVXO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102031,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spirit Fruit
