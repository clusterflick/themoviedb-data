Born July 23, 1899, in Springfield, IL, Ruth Ellis spent most of her life in Detroit. A pioneering independent black businesswoman, she operated her own print shop until the age of 65. In the home she shared with Cecilene \"Babe\" Franklin, her partner of more than 30 years, she played host to innumerable gatherings of the city's African-American gays and lesbians in an age when segregation excluded them from white homosexual society. A participant in the civil rights movement and a witness of the riots that tore Detroit apart in the 1960s, Ellis later became an icon for, and active participant in, the city's multicultural lesbian and feminist community.","popularity":0.0939,"poster_path":"/qXxJ6kWWQwY83aN5sIYMipaq2yI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living with Pride: Ruth Ellis @ 100","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1727550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yvonne Welbon","original_name":"Yvonne Welbon","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c49b5cc3a368146101e1ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0216886","wikidata_id":"Q116978286","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qXxJ6kWWQwY83aN5sIYMipaq2yI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":314127,"name":"queer history"},{"id":346871,"name":"lgbtq"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival","release_date":"1999-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
