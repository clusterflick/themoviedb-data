The project is an evocation to the transpersonal memory, a tool to appeal to images and views that are organically overlap. The image layers fused frames together in a mesh, a porous unity, the editing of a new singular body of images. An internal pulse, a vital beat becoming image and sound.  A babbling mantra â€“the projector mechanical sound-, the movement of the cars, the atmosphere and the people create an image score.  This orphan-film, found-footage, personal register is taken out of its original context and taken into an artistic discourse so as to create a new narrative thanks to the deconstruction and the addition of images. The original footage was reinterpreted in a new visual story: an expanded cinema projection.  Trance was born as a video installation composed by three projections projected simultanously.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Al trance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guillermo Zabaleta","original_name":"Guillermo Zabaleta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c87597c3a368143006be5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
