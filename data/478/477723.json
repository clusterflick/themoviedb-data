An elderly man (Lorenzo Montalban) looks back on the town where he grew up and recalls the mysteries of his youth, as well as the disappointments that led him to seek his fortune elsewhere. As the past travels by him, he recalls buildings that fell to dust, the arrest of his teachers, adventures with his schoolmates, watching a close friend catch pigeons, and discovering a boy who lived in tunnels he dug under the earth.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/t5H7GiUUfcLTfAZ2VL31xwYgxFl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141115,"logo_path":null,"name":"Madavi Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2000-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With Closed Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Das Dorf der Hunde","type":"working title"},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","title":"Con los ojos Cerrados","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorenzo Montalban","original_name":"Lorenzo Montalban","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5faf9b5cd55e4d003dcf352e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felix Alcallaga","original_name":"Felix Alcallaga","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5faf9b63ec4552003ff5eb48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rubén Fernández","original_name":"Rubén Fernández","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5faf9b92a22d3e003f0325f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Michael","original_name":"Hans Michael","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5faf9bab498ef9004080aed0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diaz Espinosa","original_name":"Diaz Espinosa","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"5faf9bb213af5f00403b32a8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Campilay","original_name":"Christian Campilay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"5faf9bb9d55e4d003ccf4c7d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mansur Madavi","original_name":"Mansur Madavi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/9CA06IVYgkt7Z16vB8Jm9WfSXxp.jpg","credit_id":"59c846bd9251415b6e0606bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mansur Madavi","original_name":"Mansur Madavi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/9CA06IVYgkt7Z16vB8Jm9WfSXxp.jpg","credit_id":"5ef6515951e6ab00332e17a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2692733,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patricio Handl Alvarez","original_name":"Patricio Handl Alvarez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef651cdc8113d0038610249","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2692729,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Orlando F.
