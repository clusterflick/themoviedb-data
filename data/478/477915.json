The film, apart from dealing with the hospital inmates and staff, also reflects the act of filming. The director never films his patients in long shots but frames parts of their bodies, so that the patients can remain anonymous.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aufnahme","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Landorf","original_name":"Stefan Landorf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c9774bc3a368141e071a6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0354394","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
