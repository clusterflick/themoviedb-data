Based on a true story, this eloquent and unflinching film charts the journey of a young boy from a war torn Uganda to his days as a soldier with the Ugandan insurgency of 1979, to his HIV positive diagnosis in Cuba, to a present day jail cell in Texas. Ultimately, what we discover is a man who in the face of adversity will do anything to survive, even if it means going to hell.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biro","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0926041","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
