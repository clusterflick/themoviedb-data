Nora is just about to take down the photographs, when Kai suddenly appears to get the rest of his stuff. His appearance is obviously too much for Nora especially when he starts helping her to take down the pictures. The more they empty the wall, the more they are reminded of their precious time together and their love for each other. While getting closer and closer again, Nora finally finds a way to open up, to tear down the wall in her head and to reveal her secret, the true reason for their breakup.","popularity":0.083,"poster_path":"/hpf7gNvD6JowXvd7HmcKfX1v8R1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95274,"logo_path":null,"name":"ROCC Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Walls","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1814607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magdalena Steinlein","original_name":"Magdalena Steinlein","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":"/hmxJUIVvgOwysIUGuTUpafY6pz6.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Nora","credit_id":"59c5981cc3a368141e0300e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1893245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Martin Schäfer","original_name":"Christian Martin Schäfer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kai","credit_id":"59c5982bc3a368146102d203","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Panian","original_name":"Rebecca Panian","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/3XcSZCDE9vTNaJn15RQddwgeR3A.jpg","credit_id":"59c598389251415b5403283c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hpf7gNvD6JowXvd7HmcKfX1v8R1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
