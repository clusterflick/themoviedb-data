Although she presents herself to the public as witty and cosmopolitan, her family bears the brunt of her more abhorrent traits. For Nick, her grandson whom she grudgingly accommodates for the weekend, it means: no mobile phone, no TV, no noise. Nick fears that these might be the worst days of his life. But then he notices strange things happening at the house next door and may have even witnessed a murder. When he and his grandmother begin to investigate, they embark on the adventure of the lives.","popularity":0.1633,"poster_path":"/nBES173zq4ktmqXKtfA5voN4ew.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28950,"logo_path":"/8RuUUKhPiJbICV03XO79IhSh8CH.png","name":"Dschoint Ventschr Filmproduktion","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2011-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murder Behind The Curtain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Glaser","original_name":"Stephanie Glaser","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/bBq9N8kQL9JU94Y7BwBZ1baFLbl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lydia Walliser","credit_id":"564a6f469251414dcd000dec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1537157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah Weber","original_name":"Noah Weber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Nick Walcher","credit_id":"564a70739251414dc4000d42","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Wyssbrod","original_name":"Peter Wyssbrod","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/v7sWC4aSaCWGi1CFqDKByQodRnC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lydias Ehemann","credit_id":"564a6f98c3a3686031000d21","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Matti","original_name":"Andreas Matti","popularity":0.0603,"profile_path":"/kFPCRF9weP4iHBaG04o52GSIeD8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Friedrich Lehnert","credit_id":"564a6fafc3a3686035000e15","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1537161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Bingisser","original_name":"Oscar Bingisser","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herbert Walcher","credit_id":"564a70699251414dc4000d39","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1537163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bigna Körner","original_name":"Bigna Körner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Schwiegertochter","credit_id":"564a7092c3a3686024000ecd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":574364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Prusa","original_name":"Alexandra Prusa","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/8iWzVnG5YBIifhE5RoVkA04hIdk.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Patrizia Lehnert","credit_id":"564a70ab9251414dc8000e78","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":49445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanspeter Bader","original_name":"Hanspeter Bader","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Kommissar Blocher","credit_id":"564a70c39251414dd1000e3a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48684,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martin Rauhaus","original_name":"Martin Rauhaus","popularity":0.1368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564a6f25c3a3686031000cef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":234177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabine Boss","original_name":"Sabine Boss","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564a6f04c3a3686035000dd5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1828249","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nBES173zq4ktmqXKtfA5voN4ew.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
