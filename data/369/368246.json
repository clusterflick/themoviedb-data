When he wins a fortune on the football pools, he decides to give half of it away to deserving people. But he neglects to include his friend Tim Sage, who filled in the coupon for him and really needs the money. Perhaps Martin doesn't acknowledge Tim because Martin is strongly sexually attracted to him. Tim's revenge upon Martin succeeds beyond his wildest dreams, setting in motion a chain of events leading to a tragic climax.","popularity":1.8668,"poster_path":"/3LFJV8QNuV6lh0qry01F1vujuxq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
