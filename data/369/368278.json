Performed in its entirety, the oratorio provides a narrative of Christ’s nativity, passion and resurrection juxtaposed against images of absurdities and abuses against the human species across the world. The film reveals a wide array of worshippers from the Bodybuilders of Christ to the Lavender Light Gay and Lesbian Interracial Choir to the Dallas police choir.","popularity":0.0769,"poster_path":"/hfyYXDn8xd8nyKyv1v37GTci7rX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55216,"logo_path":"/pyDDOSzQdVQU5F69qBOgtCn8q9J.png","name":"Kuiv Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Messiah","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Klein","original_name":"William Klein","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":"/5SLqYqn6i0KjLXWkl3tvPurMv0R.jpg","credit_id":"5645cfbdc3a36870e0008e77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1535310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michel Rotman","original_name":"Michel Rotman","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5645cfe19251410a3f008af5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Klein","original_name":"William Klein","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":"/5SLqYqn6i0KjLXWkl3tvPurMv0R.jpg","credit_id":"5645d00bc3a36870db0092c6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23465,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pascal Marti","original_name":"Pascal Marti","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/pKRvQAq4mjfYjENE7GYabFjH3TC.jpg","credit_id":"5645d02cc3a36870ec00885a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73723,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paco Wiser","original_name":"Paco Wiser","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5645d03ec3a36870e3009758","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223729","wikidata_id":"Q19363688","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hPe3YkFydwyzKUhczrtWAf3LO7d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hfyYXDn8xd8nyKyv1v37GTci7rX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":702},{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":862,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hHSpu5DtmjpgEzjCAImrIRL9uqt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
