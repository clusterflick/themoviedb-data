When the apartment owner comes home, her guest is settled in and at first, the slightly reclusive host decides simply to eat her breakfast in her room instead of having to face morning conversation with her guest. Sounds of the toilet flushing, the bath water running and splashing, footsteps pacing, and furniture moving invade the hostess' refuge in her bedroom like the frontrunners of an all-out offensive. She locks herself up for 28 days, life's detritus accumulating around her, just so she does not have to go out to face the nemesis that lurks beyond her door.","popularity":0.3858,"poster_path":"/fQQYLZpGPJtHtzYS4wJrYa6NnFz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1983-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
