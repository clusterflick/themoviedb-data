St John Quartermaine is a rather ineffective but kindly teacher at the school who, becuase of his gentle character, has hardly any enemies - in fact, the rest of the staff confide in him or generally pplay on his good nature. Then Derek Meadle arrives on the scene. He is a new part-time teacher who really wants to be full-time, but people like Quartermaine are in the way.","popularity":1.1152,"poster_path":"/ubVCDhO5U8LtwFc4ukq0PCifgGy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quartermaine's
