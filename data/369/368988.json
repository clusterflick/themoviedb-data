Fifty years later acclaimed filmmaker Emiko Omori asks her older sister and other detainees to reflect on the personal and political consequences of internment. From the exuberant recollections of a typical teenager, to the simmering rage of citizens forced to sign loyalty oaths, Omori renders a poetic and illuminating picture of a deeply troubling chapter in American history.","popularity":0.0884,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":68057,"logo_path":null,"name":"wabi-sabi","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rabbit in the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1537210,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Janice Gitek","original_name":"Janice Gitek","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564a844c9251414dc40012f4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emiko Omori","original_name":"Emiko Omori","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564a8438c3a36860310012f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1537209,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chizuko Omori","original_name":"Chizuko Omori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564a8442c3a3686037001535","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emiko Omori","original_name":"Emiko Omori","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564a85009251414dc800147d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emiko Omori","original_name":"Emiko Omori","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564a842ac3a36860280014aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7069,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pat Jackson","original_name":"Pat Jackson","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589215ef9251412dc2009c11","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emiko Omori","original_name":"Emiko Omori","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec892910fb17f001b7c5b5d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537211,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Witt Monts","original_name":"Witt Monts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec892980fb17f001c7b6765","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0181781","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
