This miracle pill is supposed to relieve her of the misery and infirmity of old age. The effect is as surprising as it is far-reaching: Frida becomes physically young again, although she remains mentally the same age as before. But who is going to believe a 25-year-old who claims to be 80? Not even her long-time gardener, Roman, recognises her anymore. Suddenly Frida finds herself penniless. After being waited on her whole life, she now has to go to work for a living. And if that were not unsettling enough, her nephew Georg and his greedy wife, Eva, pilfer everything they can from of her villa. Frida has to acknowledge that her closest relatives would literally walk over her dead body if given the chance.","popularity":0.1793,"poster_path":"/bRIQkfuqhlVhw1noc3izSvHkNX2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137073,"logo_path":null,"name":"Abrakadabra Films","origin_country":""},{"id":1927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schweizer Fernsehen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2009-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das Fräuleinwunder","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Glaser","original_name":"Stephanie Glaser","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/bBq9N8kQL9JU94Y7BwBZ1baFLbl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Frida Borel","credit_id":"564491059251410a47005a05","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":72385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mona Petri","original_name":"Mona Petri","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":"/nMlTCyVPGMe0QRpJqAvQVSylWFt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ida Froidevaux","credit_id":"564491149251410a4c00588e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buddy Elias","original_name":"Buddy Elias","popularity":0.2426,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Roman Rau","credit_id":"56449125c3a36870dd005d65","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascal Holzer","original_name":"Pascal Holzer","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Patrick 'Päde' Züger","credit_id":"5644913b9251410a530058a5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Pfammatter","original_name":"Karin Pfammatter","popularity":0.1842,"profile_path":"/7OWgn4CknaDfin9kYzoai2uLMXR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Eva Borel-Hablützel","credit_id":"5abeca4b0e0a264a5701a27f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":114687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothee Reize","original_name":"Dorothee Reize","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Oberärztin","credit_id":"5b10735d0e0a26307600c779","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495221,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Urs Bühler","original_name":"Urs Bühler","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ad8ba85b12400360ff7657","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1013975,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Felix von Muralt","original_name":"Felix von Muralt","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":"/3WQs7ijtsiawwHcLeRJNWPHGeVg.jpg","credit_id":"62ad8c4d3123450062d0816e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592766,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marco Agovino","original_name":"Marco Agovino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ad8c790d9f5a009421aae1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725783,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claudia Wick","original_name":"Claudia Wick","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/mWO9jnt5Sc0zjZoWsGpsr2JIGqs.jpg","credit_id":"62ad8c9fd2b20902f59f61a2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592762,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maike Franzen","original_name":"Maike Franzen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ad8bc555c1f40061ed0033","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":234177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabine Boss","original_name":"Sabine Boss","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564490d792514133ab005142","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1344720","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lutnlZjFXxFsCPP33x2szdniI5K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1194,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/bRIQkfuqhlVhw1noc3izSvHkNX2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":846},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1260,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/8Z7oQjzoTURROyBbjYcuxmbZy8V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":840}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Solothurner Filmtage","release_date":"2009-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
