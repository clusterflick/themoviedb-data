In the form of the letter ‘X’ is a signature – a filmic equivalent of Cartmell’s name (which is reduced by exhaustive transcription to a simple X). X is the mark of those who cannot write, or who do not know their own names. Photographed over time against a backdrop of the Canadian Shield, X shows Cartmell’s son Sam running in slow motion towards the camera, and, in the film’s second half, away from it. The shape/structure of the movie is chiasmatic, part of the old avant-garde dream of creating movies that could be run backwards and forwards. The movie is in two parts that form an X.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/yda6H9ruKXuy01e3ZjJkQOprME2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the form of the letter X","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1806808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Cartmell","original_name":"Mike Cartmell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/7vd2x9ACkrouA1bxLv0e6Pfmxgi.jpg","credit_id":"6601c3b61b1f3c017c9c498c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0201686","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":971,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yda6H9ruKXuy01e3ZjJkQOprME2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":648}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
