The Cree population of what is now Northern Québec adopted the instrument, and many contemporary Cree residents are master fiddlers. In this film, two Cree fiddlers travel to the Orkney Islands, the birthplace of the music they learned from their fathers and grandfathers. The film captures the warmth and good will of this reunion.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zxypRuhZfX8pCPOSfh4ZSwGOso0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":213332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nishnawbe Institute","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fiddlers of James Bay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3638061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Rodgers","original_name":"Bob Rodgers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e00c8a481382004fbc65dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225720","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zxypRuhZfX8pCPOSfh4ZSwGOso0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
