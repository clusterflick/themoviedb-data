Her drunken dad still stuck in his Santa suit from the local Christmas pagent, follows and soon comes in contact with the \"new dark ages\" of 1984. Juxtapositions of \"on-the street\" interviews (by Willie Boy Walker), punk performances by bands Flipper and The Mutants, TV shows of past-life hypnotism and nuclear destruction, and a crazed ex-con all finally intermix with the characters' own sagas.","popularity":0.1336,"poster_path":"/oBvnVClSEnQLe3Re9oW2ZRy64tX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Target
