Their only block was the 500 monk-soldiers protecting the Shaolin Temple. Under the pretense of an order from the Emperor, Prince Fu sent all 500 monk-soldiers away to fight bandits, leaving Shaolin Temple unprotected. Guang Ci had been training some of the young monks in martial arts. With the 500 monk-soldiers gone, Prince Fu planned his ambush and his army began surrounding the Shaolin Temple. Aware of Prince Fu's evil intentions, the young monks defend the temple with Tong Deng leading. Only his \"Tong Zi Gong\" can overwhelm Prince Fu's \"Light Kicking\" in this struggle for consummate power. Superb Wu Shu fights in the tradition of Jet Li's, Shaolin temple.","popularity":0.0908,"poster_path":"/xXvWvCzgUdlS9jSSWa698BXA4mB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190281,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gam Ma Film Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1984-05-12","revenue":309703,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Consummate Power","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Consummate Power","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Consumate Power: Shaolin Tongzipong","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","title":"ดุที่หัวตัวต่างหาก","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1911262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhang Long","original_name":"Zhang Long","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59eed4519251412a2902b206","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1911263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wang Li-Sha","original_name":"Wang Li-Sha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Cui Cui","credit_id":"59eed46e925141366d0313b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1911264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wong Hing-Yuk","original_name":"Wong Hing-Yuk","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"59eed494c3a36851bd035b78","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siu Chiu-Ming","original_name":"Siu Chiu-Ming","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"59eed4c4c3a36841c7005f39","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3869269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Lan","original_name":"Li Lan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"63c0222123be4600892cbf4c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3869270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhang Tie-Ming","original_name":"Zhang Tie-Ming","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"63c02235df857c00bc2122ae","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3869271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Qiu Fang-Jian","original_name":"Qiu Fang-Jian","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"63c0225323be4600892cbf60","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1789338,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wan Kwai","original_name":"Wan Kwai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c013c88efe7300a0ea3f29","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3788857,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Poon Siu-yau","original_name":"Poon Siu-yau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c013f305a53300c10fdcde","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3869174,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Hung Wai-Gwan","original_name":"Hung Wai-Gwan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c013dddf857c0081411f43","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hou Shih","original_name":"Hou Shih","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59eed3e19251412783037637","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1911260,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shi Hau","original_name":"Shi Hau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59eed3f6c3a36851bd035a94","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0165468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rd84CHNmF6xUzKNE9uDPLmKPfoy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xXvWvCzgUdlS9jSSWa698BXA4mB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/zGaEYlwrVdEj0ybUd65KeSmDkJi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"th","file_path":"/9gDAr3PDmTeWmV7LqtMYYn5KEam.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1984-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
