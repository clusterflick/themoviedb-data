As a young girl named Biondetta - blond and innocent as an angel - Lucifer appears to the young Spanish nobleman Alvarez, who is an officer in the service of the King of Naples. In this guise, it is easy for the devil to make the young Spaniard fall in love with him. But Eros has a hard time when strict custom and morality suppress nature. In vain the devil tempts him with the pleasures of the world. Neither carnival, gambling, nor the most beautiful courtesan can yet soften the officer. Or can they?","popularity":0.1453,"poster_path":"/1yHqP8k3fJCm0irmEBD4PYyhV6Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1971-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der verliebte Teufel","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1341014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christiane Schröder","original_name":"Christiane Schröder","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Biondetta","credit_id":"5648b8a6c3a3682614007f3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolf Roth","original_name":"Wolf Roth","popularity":0.4556,"profile_path":"/kkvwbp04dz6SABUlhbUOkuLoANT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Don Alvarez","credit_id":"5648b8b19251413acf007e58","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Engels","original_name":"Wolfgang Engels","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hauptmann","credit_id":"5648b8c09251413acc007dad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Brandt","original_name":"Martin Brandt","popularity":0.1352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Priester","credit_id":"5648b8cc9251413adb007a31","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birke Bruck","original_name":"Birke Bruck","popularity":0.1288,"profile_path":"/7WWcrMMrCwz0bqDRRTVkjiyL5T6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Olympia","credit_id":"5648b8e0c3a368260c007e24","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37474,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Wolffhardt","original_name":"Rainer Wolffhardt","popularity":0.1569,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5648b897c3a3682620008087","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0396921","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2161,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/1yHqP8k3fJCm0irmEBD4PYyhV6Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
