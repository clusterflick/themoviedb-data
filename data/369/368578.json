From the end of the War up until last year, these paintings hung in the Austrian National Gallery. The film covers Maria's early life in glittering fin-de-si√®cle Vienna, her dramatic escape from Nazi terror and her courageous fight to recover the five Klimt's against all the odds. Maria's fight to reclaim the paintings eventually took her to the United States Supreme Court and pitted her not just against Austria but also against the US Government which asked the Supreme Court to reject her case. After Maria finally emerged victorious in 2006, one of the paintings - the \"Golden Portrait\" of Maria's aunt, Adele Bloch Bauer - was sold to cosmetics tycoon Ronald Lauder for $135m, becoming the world's most expensive painting ever sold. The other four paintings were recently auctioned at Christie's for record prices.","popularity":0.3919,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":67836,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poppy Pictures","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stealing Klimt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'affaire Klimt","type":"French"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Aftos o Klimt mou anikei","type":"German"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1535988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Altmann","original_name":"Maria Altmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5647275e9251413ade002f3c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1535989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael J.
