Now it's believed that he sought out sanctuary in the house of a man (Hughes), and that the man threw him out. And it's also believed that the boy being Hispanic was probably part of a gang and that the whole thing was gang related, so the police don't consider any need to investigate the incident. But a teacher (Kelly) doesn't believe this, and sets out to find out what happened that night by talking to the man, but he doesn't want to talk about it.","popularity":1.3365,"poster_path":"/7RL779RegWnpGRPQVlya1diiWI7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97056,"logo_path":null,"name":"Herbert Brodkin Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":149153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theater Center","origin_country":""},{"id":15131,"logo_path":null,"name":"Titus Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night of Courage","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Hugh Kelly","original_name":"Daniel Hugh Kelly","popularity":0.4584,"profile_path":"/bueEXd57jY2PWZUC1nRRBmIE2Ou.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Paul Forrest","credit_id":"5bdcdff692514137cd000bb8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barnard Hughes","original_name":"Barnard Hughes","popularity":0.4236,"profile_path":"/1QwqpJ37wE5cjrDxHoTWfZk4oVs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Abner Abelsen","credit_id":"5bdce0090e0a26057e000d91","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geraldine Fitzgerald","original_name":"Geraldine Fitzgerald","popularity":0.4017,"profile_path":"/jLpd1AxJIAYHE41kIJjXKAK5Vnn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Abby Abelsen","credit_id":"5bdce02c0e0a26057e000dc5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lili Taylor","original_name":"Lili Taylor","popularity":1.1192,"profile_path":"/kP1tZLv3IclVldzeG9OINJXXxlU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marina","credit_id":"5bdce04292514137d8000cb3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1863632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"D.
