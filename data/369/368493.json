The intricate plot also deals with destinies of other characters, who finally come together in a dramatic encounter at one time and in one place. In his role as screenwriter and director, Anton produced a highly accomplished version of Mácha’s work. He respected the original but was also able, along with the DoP Karel Kopřiva, to capitalise on the possibilities that the film medium offered. For the Venice prologue, the filmmakers exploited the photogenic qualities of the city – the narrow streets, the lagoons, gondolas and the sea – and they moved the set to the enigmatic Czech landscape around the castle of Kokořín.","popularity":0.1475,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":53989,"logo_path":null,"name":"A-B","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1922-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gypsies","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Gypsies","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Gitanos","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Gypsies","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1535917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Svoboda","original_name":"Hugo Svoboda","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Giacomo","credit_id":"5646d5e79251413ade001ef9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1322223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Augustová","original_name":"Olga Augustová","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":"/1GoygKpCirBOEOzeAuRY3rTlsfV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Angelina","credit_id":"5646d5f2c3a368261400219d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodor Pištěk","original_name":"Theodor Pištěk","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/aTCDZ0JJ2xC4Du282Ha3Kqzc9Q1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Count Valdemar Lomecký","credit_id":"5646d5fdc3a368260c001fd1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1535918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfons Rasp","original_name":"Alfons Rasp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Son of Valdemar Lomecký","credit_id":"5646d609c3a3682611001e41","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julius Czonský","original_name":"Julius Czonský","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Innkeeper","credit_id":"5646d612c3a368260c001fd5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1263891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bronislava Livia","original_name":"Bronislava Livia","popularity":0.0889,"profile_path":"/fKHhAtAU3LxBbfkUwniaNlLQQtn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lea","credit_id":"5646d61bc3a3682620001f9c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2389270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karel Fiala","original_name":"Karel Fiala","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/tmPKJp6U0aPPtYtgQOoc6xIBFnI.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Administrator of a manor","credit_id":"5d58182de8131d4a118b38cf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karel Schleichert","original_name":"Karel Schleichert","popularity":0.1007,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Old Veteran","credit_id":"5646d62ec3a3682605001f12","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Šváb-Malostranský","original_name":"Josef Šváb-Malostranský","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/s9r95D2fevZXkaR9Tm80pSLowGA.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Guest","credit_id":"5646d637c3a3682608002004","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1535919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karel Faltys","original_name":"Karel Faltys","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Napoleon","credit_id":"5646d642c3a3682611001e4f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1469815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiřina Janderová","original_name":"Jiřina Janderová","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Countess Lomecká","credit_id":"5646d64cc3a368260800200a","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1414576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jindřich Edl","original_name":"Jindřich Edl","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Presiding Judge","credit_id":"5646d654c3a368261a001ff2","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1535920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"František Kudláček","original_name":"František Kudláček","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Priest","credit_id":"5646d65dc3a368261a001ff8","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan W.
