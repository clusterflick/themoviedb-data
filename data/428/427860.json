But Bimshofer doesn’t know, that Lenerl has long been a couple with the servant Sepp.  So he suspects that every young man in the village wants to conquer his poor, innocent daughter.  So that Lenerl really resists all these attempts, he gets a stone statue from Thomas Kammerlehner’s barn, “The Chaste Kunigunde”, which is supposed to protect the girl’s chastity and to protect her
