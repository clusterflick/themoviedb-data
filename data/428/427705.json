The interplay between the two sets of imagery is not simple. Wyborny photographs his modern ruins at their most ravishing – at dawn or sunset, partially reflected in the water or glimpsed through the trees. Shots recur throughout, optically printed into brilliant colours or else, given the washed out quality of fifth generation Xeroxes. As there are few people shown, one’s impression is of a planet that is populated mainly by cows, barges and hydraulic drills.","popularity":0.0586,"poster_path":"/wyepEKYI2iIJSyetQ1zKLW8216c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1975-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pictures of the Lost Word","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Wyborny","original_name":"Klaus Wyborny","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/wQRb6cnUErO4HuYmXsMFAmUglK6.jpg","credit_id":"5838b49e9251413f9d000230","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6088288","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wyepEKYI2iIJSyetQ1zKLW8216c.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":503},{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1490,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r7f9gXcAAe4Njl5CoPZ5Yk4d5fg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xW7vu84etAa9HLKpfex8fhqmN0A.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Anthology Film Archives","release_date":"1975-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
