Her intense choreography is dedicated to her own extreme experiences and emotions. Her approach will spare nothing and nobody. She expects unconditional commitment from herself, but also from her dancers. As a result, we get to witness innovative and highly successful dance performances, but also a complicated hate-love relationship with the people around her.  In The Lady in Black, director Lisa Boerstra (L.A. Raeven) shows us the extent to which Ann is interwoven with the choreographies, bringing the artistâ€™s life and work together in a new experience.","popularity":0.0603,"poster_path":"/gyWmGAO6D3jNWrEW69q8PSnCVqn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lady in Black","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Van den Broek","original_name":"Ann Van den Broek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"58355aa19251416c2e00c9c0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1506655,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annemiek van der Hell","original_name":"Annemiek van der Hell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wtr4JXP8WBAJE2FALrwRMaqjVCV.jpg","credit_id":"58355ad1c3a3682f9d013665","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Boerstra","original_name":"Lisa Boerstra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58355ab09251416d22013260","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4835674","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gyWmGAO6D3jNWrEW69q8PSnCVqn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
