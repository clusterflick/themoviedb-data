Underground trains, streetcars, buses and escalators embody the impressionistic beauty of architectural reflections like moving paintings. The face of the city is rendered as a light-infused intersection of people, glass, and concrete. Part 1 takes place underground, with an audio collage mixed from ambient recordings of subway stations and trains. Part 2 takes place above ground and features an original score with gamelans, guitar loops, sampled car door locks and brake pumps. â€“ KPR","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arcs of Texture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Paul Rosenthal","original_name":"Ken Paul Rosenthal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5833c1909251412733005d22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
