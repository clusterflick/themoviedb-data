In comically absurd as well as tragic episodes describing small victories and major defeats, homesickness and class distinctions, the film offers - using home movies, photographs and current professional footage - deep insights into the filmmaker's family history. It is an attempt to illustrate the balancing act between \"up here\" (Austria) and \"down there\" (Yugoslavia/Croatia) that characterizes generations of guest workers. Directed by Djordje Cenic and Hermann Peseckas.  - Written by Djordje Cenic","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unten","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712420,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Đorđe Cenić","original_name":"Đorđe Cenić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5833e783c3a368338d00835c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712420,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Đorđe Cenić","original_name":"Đorđe Cenić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5833e78f9251412733008c32","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hermann Peseckas","original_name":"Hermann Peseckas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5833e79b925141272f00911f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712420,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Đorđe Cenić","original_name":"Đorđe Cenić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5833e884925141272f00922d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712422,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Djoki Django","original_name":"Djoki Django","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5833e891c3a3683391007f9f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hermann Peseckas","original_name":"Hermann Peseckas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5833e89dc3a36833a2008b25","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328922,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dominik Spritzendorfer","original_name":"Dominik Spritzendorfer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5833e8b192514127420088e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hermann Peseckas","original_name":"Hermann Peseckas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5833e8c9925141273c009255","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5953730","wikidata_id":"Q26911184","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Crossing Europe Film Festival","release_date":"2016-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"UNTEN / DOWN THERE - TRAILER","key":"6d2QiG2Ebi8","published_at":"2016-09-22T09:27:51.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"59ee36c69251412a2901e77f"}]}}}
