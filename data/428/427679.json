Sheku has six musically gifted siblings and this film explores their extraordinary talents and issues of diversity in classical music.  We follow Sheku and his brothers and sisters and examine the sacrifices that parents Stuart and Kadie make in order to support their children in pursuing their musical dreams. Told through the prism of family life we get an understanding of what it is that drives this family to be the best musicians they can be.  At the heart of the story is 17-year-old Sheku, and we see him coming to terms with his Young Musician win and the pressures and opportunities it brings. His life is changing dramatically as he now has to learn to deal with the challenges of becoming a world-renowned cellist.","popularity":0.1702,"poster_path":"/kBZ1JCAFVelXqSvoOJ7dGE65X8q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44534,"logo_path":"/erve95rk8IXbmZLKcx5aBDMwwT3.png","name":"Outline Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Young, Gifted and Classical: The Making of a Maestro","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2497370,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sheku Kanneh-Mason","original_name":"Sheku Kanneh-Mason","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/izKo6stsj47mPJxNKp4Nma6ienY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e51a036a93d250013491887","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1718419,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Clare Bradbury","original_name":"Clare Bradbury","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5844b5909251416b2600e746","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1718418,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bridget Boseley","original_name":"Bridget Boseley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5844b56a9251416a7400ec86","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1718417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eddie Hutton-Mills","original_name":"Eddie Hutton-Mills","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/3sOkwL1NYrI7VKoVCCHYtJ8t0kL.jpg","credit_id":"5844b536c3a368472200ec98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6292658","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kBZ1JCAFVelXqSvoOJ7dGE65X8q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
