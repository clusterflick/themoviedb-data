Alejandro, on the other hand, has been going up day by day, he has grown up with his work, believing in himself -he is an economist- he has fought with all his strength to achieve a higher social level and he has succeeded. He is a professor in the University, executive of a great company, owner, in short, of a beautiful villa in the outskirts. But he is, nevertheless, in the critical age, in the age of taking stock of his past, of justifying himself. And the truth is that, despite his material triumph, he is not happy, there is no reason to be in his participation in society, he is not satisfied with anything. It is, in a word, a step away from his inner failure. In this situation he discovers, in turn, that María accuses him of having dedicated more time to succeed than to love her.","popularity":0.1582,"poster_path":"/Ar9XUOvqsgNUo4q3M2jzDj33Glh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love and Other Solitudes","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucia Bosè","original_name":"Lucia Bosè","popularity":0.5802,"profile_path":"/9YQcKtzFTvBWpJEQKE5iymSvywm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"María","credit_id":"58342a449251416c630026ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":537175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Estrada","original_name":"Carlos Estrada","popularity":0.3698,"profile_path":"/8RpfUU8pM6hoAUMkHxsGxKm6GyI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alejandro Lenador","credit_id":"58342a5a925141691b0029c5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Basilio Martín Patino","original_name":"Basilio Martín Patino","popularity":0.0893,"profile_path":"/dnlZnbdFpAq60O2mpNhJehdHYYt.jpg","credit_id":"58342a10c3a3682fad002586","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0064220","wikidata_id":"Q27590177","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ar9XUOvqsgNUo4q3M2jzDj33Glh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1969-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
