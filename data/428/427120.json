Sicixia is an intended peripheral film. Periphery is where the world gets different, not where it ends. For Romans, Finisterrae was the end of the world. Sicixia wants it to start from here. Sicixia portrays Costa da Morte's unique heritage by intertwining fiction and reality, powerful images with subtle and rich sounds and stories.","popularity":0.1034,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2016-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"98","title":"Sicixia","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1042791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monti Castiñeiras","original_name":"Monti Castiñeiras","popularity":0.2018,"profile_path":"/a71pSyYqIyID5segsahivEIRITz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5842c7d29251417ec000809f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1074524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marta Lado","original_name":"Marta Lado","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/mTyUFiJwwJwhVGhaCTwKh51JTBy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5842c7de9251417eca0081d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1074518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Canosa","original_name":"Tamara Canosa","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5842c831c3a36876b8008ce4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1019690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Vilar","original_name":"Ignacio Vilar","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58339d8e925141273c002f9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5822414","wikidata_id":"Q28157569","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
