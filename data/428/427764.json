She doesnâ€™t seem too thrilled to see him. But he is really, really thrilled to see Choo-Choo. The dog used to be his and he is less-than-thrilled to learn that Lacey has since re-named the dog Rummy. This fateful first encounter (after a break-up three years ago) triggers a rapid escalation of tensions in this typically funny and bizarre early Zellner tale.","popularity":0.1524,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"breakups are hard, but breaking windows can be harder.","title":"Rummy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1714324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Wilson","original_name":"Stephanie Wilson","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lacy","credit_id":"583974e2c3a36843ef003ae3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Zellner","original_name":"David Zellner","popularity":0.3465,"profile_path":"/w2uBusvakUVhoeTCT0xDwoV9WJB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"583974ec9251416b0d0075b8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Zellner","original_name":"David Zellner","popularity":0.3465,"profile_path":"/w2uBusvakUVhoeTCT0xDwoV9WJB.jpg","credit_id":"5839744cc3a36848b50030e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Zellner","original_name":"Nathan Zellner","popularity":0.1264,"profile_path":"/6IVmtZTtJwTFQrzvU9D76IWWYAx.jpg","credit_id":"583974609251416f690031ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
