For a strange twist of fate, one day he falls asleep and he wakes up in the waters of the beautiful and sunny Sicily. Here he will meet new people and among them, Salvo, a young boy who is about to face his future life. Unfortunately he will also be the witness of a murder that will complicate even more his stay on the island. Everything seems to end tragically, when a dramatic turn of events will change this story in a grotesque and comic comedy with romantic implications.","popularity":0.1328,"poster_path":"/5OAL715ExKDcGzxonyJGDjdAgKT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83829,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Chirco Edizioni Musicali e Cinema Crema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Briciole sul mare","video":false,"vote_average":2.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Nestola","original_name":"Walter Nestola","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":"/gOGQkvDMusjiJHPONcFCnh3sDVL.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Salvo","credit_id":"583b1997925141149a0078eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1715024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorena Noce","original_name":"Lorena Noce","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"583b19aec3a36877a20043f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1715025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nino Chirco","original_name":"Nino Chirco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Pescatore","credit_id":"583b19cdc3a368622c007a65","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Nestola","original_name":"Walter Nestola","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":"/gOGQkvDMusjiJHPONcFCnh3sDVL.jpg","credit_id":"583b19e9c3a36877a200441e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Nestola","original_name":"Walter Nestola","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":"/gOGQkvDMusjiJHPONcFCnh3sDVL.jpg","credit_id":"583b19fb9251416f690126b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guido Cerniglia","original_name":"Guido Cerniglia","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/lS3MVavgLHsuoU34LuJc2AOsqRM.jpg","credit_id":"583b1a13c3a3686354006546","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2049936,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marco Augusto Comba","original_name":"Marco Augusto Comba","popularity":0.1501,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c057ab20e0a264866084e40","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6139494","wikidata_id":"Q65619089","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bXutToSC215bWXsSHTLAeA4Cs20.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/AoG8QmK2wJJWu7wF2FgnInC1hm7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5OAL715ExKDcGzxonyJGDjdAgKT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BRICIOLE SUL MARE - TRAILER UFFICIALE [HD]","key":"N43FK9Eo1dM","published_at":"2015-09-22T13:48:39.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"583b1ac7c3a36843ef014834"}]}}}
