An unsuspecting man is hired as a surrogate father.  The income is good, the apartment is fully furnished, only the children's room is empty. A middle-class couple (Donata Höffner and “Tatort” detective Charles Brauer) desperately want a child. But the doctors say the potential father is infertile. With her husband's consent, the woman hits on a former lover (Dietrich Mattausch). He doesn't need to be asked twice and is soon in bed with her... Dominik Graf received the Young Director Award at the Bavarian Film Festival for his original final project at the Munich University.","popularity":0.2239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":665,"logo_path":"/bUomMJoEX2W7XpgvNeWswCFKzrW.png","name":"Hochschule für Fernsehen und Film München","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1979-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der kostbare Gast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donata Höffer","original_name":"Donata Höffer","popularity":0.079,"profile_path":"/7RBeKlvGOnKoRmsSG05JEX9Lhyc.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Margarethe","credit_id":"58386172925141423900027e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Brauer","original_name":"Charles Brauer","popularity":0.2354,"profile_path":"/pmzsKoimIu9ZaUfCyuJF1BJb0da.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Menzel","credit_id":"5838617dc3a368492e000255","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dietrich Mattausch","original_name":"Dietrich Mattausch","popularity":0.129,"profile_path":"/p2e10ekMFCsBKUe4zrmmfyynAE3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Liebenfels","credit_id":"58386188925141423900028e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Astrid Boner","original_name":"Astrid Boner","popularity":0.2911,"profile_path":"/c45pZyE9azhpfh2133TDOorn5Sx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5838618f92514142330002c1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1714017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Jakob","original_name":"Hans Jakob","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5838619c92514142420002b1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter E.
