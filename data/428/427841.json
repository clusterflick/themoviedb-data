The young man wants to break out of this life and believes he has finally found the opportunity to do so. A job advertisement promising 400 marks a week seems tailor-made for him. He quickly makes the acquaintance of a pusher column run by Kalle. But Tommy's ideas of a free life are soon nipped in the bud: He works more than 12 hours a day, goes from door to door to sell magazine subscriptions, lives in a filthy shared room, experiences psychological violence. He leads a life like a slave. How can he get out of this hopeless situation?","popularity":0.5114,"poster_path":"/AcmeJW5rHOS6lLwXhX0z2Gnn6Ta.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207503,"logo_path":null,"name":"FFG Film- und
