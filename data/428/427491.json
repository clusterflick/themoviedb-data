Jeffries, of Los Angeles, California, and Gus Ruhlin, of Akron, Ohio, engaged in a sparring contest in the ring of the Twentieth Century Athletic Club, at Mechanic's Pavilion, San Francisco. By special arrangements with the promoters of the contest, Messrs. J.C. Kennedy, Wm. Madden and Wm. Delaney, our cameras were on hand, and we secured authentic pictures of the contest. In order to record these pictures, it was necessary to specially equip the building with a large number of arc lights. To this end no expense was spared, and when the fighters entered the ring it was illuminated with 300,00 candle-power of light. Thus we are able to present to our customers, not imitation or fake pictures of the contest, but the actual exhibition just as it took place, with the audience assembled. The pictures that were secured show every movement in the contest, from the time Jeffries entered the ring until he left it a victor in the 5th round.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1921-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeffries and Ruhlin Sparring Contest at San Francisco, Cal., November 15, 1901","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0231818","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1921-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
