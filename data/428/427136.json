Mei-Hsia is from the most prominent family in town. Yun-Lang works in the local peasant assocation. They like each other, but Mei-Hsia is afraid to tell her mother about their seeing each other. They wait till Yun-Lang sends a matchmaker to Mei-Hsia's family. There was no way that Mei-Hsia's family would agree to their marriage. Mei-Hsia's parents send her to a relative in the northeast of Keelung, in an attempt to stop them from seeing each other, but Yun-Lang follows her there. Mei-Hsia's relative doesn't stop them until Mei-Hsia's mother finds out. Now their love is an open affair. This time, it's the Mei-Hsias turn to propose a marriage between the two families. To everyone's surprise, the Yun-Langs turn it down. Mei-Hsia and Yun-Lang planned to elope, but they failed. She kills herself. At last, Yun-Lang can call Mei-Hsia his wife by marring her memorial tablet.","popularity":0.1673,"poster_path":"/5NAlGRaoefNXBsG4oW0BkXKu3N4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1985-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Matrimony","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"Jie hun","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"His Matrimony","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Marriage","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1591881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yang Chieh-mei","original_name":"楊潔玫","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/bUOWuEII51ffSXW7rTavZgizKCL.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mei-Hsia","credit_id":"5fd724ecdb952d003f7d1c52","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yang Ching-huang","original_name":"Yang Ching-huang","popularity":0.1115,"profile_path":"/qnTOKLQJf0ZsZvVryAUanTJ8Hdl.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Yun-Lang","credit_id":"5fd725268c44b9003cd8a7ea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2490189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chen Chiu-Yen","original_name":"Chen Chiu-Yen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mei-Hsia's mother","credit_id":"5fd72577db952d00407cf62a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1609496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Chen Shu-Fang","original_name":"陳淑芳","popularity":0.3204,"profile_path":"/b6HFWVa7UwexYgFIXGmTnPdiYcz.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Yun-Lang's mother","credit_id":"5fd725a3681888003f983e90","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1630058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wu Min","original_name":"Wu Min","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":"/vyl8apwfnyVnw2NpxFVgIJkqCtm.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5fd725b868188800409852fc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chen Kun-Hou","original_name":"陳坤厚","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/9tOTyqMmdyvEXHjIiIWNQxixWrO.jpg","credit_id":"5833b5129251412739004cdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":69831,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chu Tien-wen","original_name":"朱天文","popularity":0.2802,"profile_path":"/2h5iQTWNWI2IIifyaVY3oP2NVr1.jpg","credit_id":"5833ba3bc3a3683387004f65","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712384,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ting Ya-min","original_name":"Ting Ya-min","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5833ba4d925141273c0056b8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1712385,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hsu Su-Chen","original_name":"許淑貞","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5833ba5f925141272d0050c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chen Kun-Hou","original_name":"陳坤厚","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/9tOTyqMmdyvEXHjIiIWNQxixWrO.jpg","credit_id":"58491c3192514119c2010bce","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69834,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Liao Ching-Sung","original_name":"廖慶松","popularity":0.1723,"profile_path":"/8Ktd27fyAxTqzf736RT5EogAqMc.jpg","credit_id":"58491c46c3a368141f0107b4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2323642,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chen Yang","original_name":"Chen Yang","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/erbLMlgMx2GDF2J7I7PzkuTogyn.jpg","credit_id":"674613b793f2cdebcc2e435b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0494731","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5NAlGRaoefNXBsG4oW0BkXKu3N4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
