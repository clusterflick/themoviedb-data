The artists document their collaborations with international institutions, both educational and private enterprise, and individuals alike in an attempt to send cutting edge imaging equipment into heart of the Aurora at an altitude of approximately 300 km. The film chronicles their successes and challenges provoking conversations concerning how we as a society define achievement, while addressing humankind's pensive effort to coax the marriage between faith (mythology, religion) and empirical evidence.","popularity":0.1258,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"}],"release_date":"2020-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bifröst into the Aurora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713755,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Adamsons","original_name":"Eric Adamsons","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5837e903925141318f020261","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713756,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Heins Kim","original_name":"Heins Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5837e936c3a36836a301ed88","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samúel Hjaltalín","original_name":"Samúel Hjaltalín","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5837e975c3a36836ae01d99d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613892,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toya Bonnin","original_name":"Toya Bonnin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5837e9aec3a36836a901fe03","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713755,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Adamsons","original_name":"Eric Adamsons","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5837ea29925141319801ebda","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713756,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Heins Kim","original_name":"Heins Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5837ea62c3a36836a901fe75","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713755,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Adamsons","original_name":"Eric Adamsons","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5837ea72c3a36836a901fe81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713755,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Adamsons","original_name":"Eric Adamsons","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5837ea819251414cb9011f65","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713756,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Heins Kim","original_name":"Heins Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5837ea91925141319801ec12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713756,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Heins Kim","original_name":"Heins Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5837eaa1c3a368247d019ead","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5175624","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
