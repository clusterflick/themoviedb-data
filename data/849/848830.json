In this behind-the-scenes documentary, shot during the making of his final work, The Little Girl Who Sold the Sun / La petite vendeuse de soleil, Mambéty speaks with his technicians, prepares the actors, talks with his young star, and, in voiceover, shares his thoughts on cinema and life.Mambéty doesn't differ significantly from the stock \"behind-the-scenes\" documentaries that adorn most DVDs nowadays, except that Mambéty's films have scenes you actually want to be taken behind. Because of the kind of attention that gets paid to African cinema, there's an initial intrigue to Mambéty, but that interest is sustained by Mambéty's own lyrical insights into his aesthetics.","popularity":0.3526,"poster_path":"/kmVLCWtiC5dr4LuYqvfiKItNJLh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SN","name":"Senegal"}],"release_date":"2002-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Wolof","iso_639_1":"wo","name":"Wolof"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mambéty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079380,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Djibril Diop Mambéty","original_name":"Djibril Diop Mambéty","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/qP0a19xyKBoAY22ZsnJJy9Okfm6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60e75145168ea3005d9df9b3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3150549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Papa Madièye Mbaye","original_name":"Papa Madièye Mbaye","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e7512e4d67910046b8432d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/irlYIP5TPBoRBoIxIMZp4IET9YV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zeF8vtbA9WufyoOvhFgJjqZ4fR0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kmVLCWtiC5dr4LuYqvfiKItNJLh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":282511,"name":"senegalese cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2002-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
