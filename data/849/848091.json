The doctor instructs that he not be moved, so Gloria nurses the stranger back to health, although his memory fails to return. Gloria falls in love with her patient and, upon discovering that he is millionaire sportsman Jerry O'Farrell, rushes home to restore his identity, only to find that he has gone. Amnesia continues to plague Jerry, and he soon forgets both Gloria's name and address. While he is attending a show at the follies, a fire breaks out, and Gloria, recognizing her lover in the audience, rushes to save him. Meanwhile, Shaw, who has discovered Gloria's feelings for Jerry, accosts her. Jerry, who has finally regained his memory, intercedes and rescues Gloria, and the two fall in love.","popularity":0.1519,"poster_path":"/3PDxGimkqxhJxMbrTcFicYcgZoV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selznick Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-02-14","revenue":200000,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Footlights and Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olive Thomas","original_name":"Olive Thomas","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/coDCGDmaICZjiBK8nReFerZ8Oja.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gloria Dawn","credit_id":"60e3c7fecaa5080060ef3f12","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3147387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Onslow","original_name":"Alex Onslow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jerry O' Farrell","credit_id":"60e3c81c6bdec3004605a190","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivo Dawson","original_name":"Ivo Dawson","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/aUzckdsLKuzTKHETSfr3hZF7AQ5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Peter Shaw","credit_id":"60e3c8311e9225007ed76cd7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3147388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mr. Farrell","original_name":"Mr. Farrell","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"60e3c8545e14e500734501e4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3147389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"May Hicks","original_name":"May Hicks","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Colored Mammy","credit_id":"60e3c869caa508002effae69","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3147393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E.
