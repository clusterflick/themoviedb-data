Later, Prudence visits her New York aunt, a society matron, and soon attracts an array of male admirers. She falls in love with wealthy Grayson Mills, but John Melbourne, who lives off of his wife's wealth, plots to seduce her. After Melbourne loans Prudence $200 to pay a gambling debt, he forces her to go to a roadhouse by threatening to show her stern father her canceled check. At dinner, Prudence produces a love letter which Melbourne had earlier written to an actress, and says that if she is not back by midnight, her hotel clerk will show Melbourne's wife his nineteen other love letters. After Melbourne hurries her back, he discovers that she only had the one letter. Prudence now becomes engaged to Grayson.","popularity":0.5079,"poster_path":"/5ubZog7U5ctACQb1KpbT7gcxv5g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Dramatic Comedy with plenty of action in which demureness disarms a scoundrel and is trapped by a woman's wit","title":"Prudence on Broadway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Prudence Comes to Town","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olive Thomas","original_name":"Olive Thomas","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/coDCGDmaICZjiBK8nReFerZ8Oja.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Prudence","credit_id":"60e3c4a01e9225007ed7641e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis McDonald","original_name":"Francis McDonald","popularity":0.2683,"profile_path":"/5sIApbjJvZx0KvEDEk7BWKUuAeg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Grayson Mills","credit_id":"60e3c4b96bdec30046057e26","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harvey Clark","original_name":"Harvey Clark","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/mRxpnLg6ybAnFCoEOu3sK6b8hMV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"John Melbourne","credit_id":"60e3c4d24ca6760075055a2e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3147104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.P.
