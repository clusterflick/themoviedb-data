Aisula was not interested in palace intrigues. The girl fed snow-white pigeons, took care of greenhouse plants, quenched her curiosity by talking to a wise astronomer at the observatory. Love transformed Khan Taukel, belligerence began to grow into wisdom, awakening mercy and kindness. But the insidious sister of Khan Karashash, who has long dreamed of power, took advantage of her brother's forced departure and slandered the shepherd's daughter, spreading a rumor that she had given birth to two puppies.","popularity":0.3151,"poster_path":"/nJA9Uj2mhEap50bbRSLUrd5Q9A6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":232195,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kazakhfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet
