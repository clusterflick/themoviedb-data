Thousands of people contribute to the success of the Badenfahrt in numerous clubs and pubs - a festival that unites the many volunteers for ten days and nights. Over a million people celebrated the last Badenfahrt. Some of the diverse people, whether asylum seekers or CEOs, who played an active role, are accompanied by this cinema documentary. Whether it's a handful of friends daringly building a pub on a steep slope, a young team turning night into day with a party club, or half a village aiming high with its rocket launching ramp: the countless helpers, who go their own ways in normal life, join forces to create something unique before, during and after the Badenfahrt. This feel-good movie is an emotional plea for diversity and for volunteerism in a country where associations are an important pillar of society.","popularity":0.2869,"poster_path":"/waV6OFnZXeOs8hJ6PFMyL87yXF8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156855,"logo_path":null,"name":"REDSPACE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BADENFAHRT – FEST VEREINT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolf Lang","original_name":"Rolf Lang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e458ee6bdec30046084f13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14799808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gEVQsLTlFN00AqAkgqRZH2Kbawu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/waV6OFnZXeOs8hJ6PFMyL87yXF8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8054,"name":"volunteer"},{"id":6578,"name":"association"},{"id":160213,"name":"festival"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BADENFAHRT – FEST VEREINT – Trailer","key":"472672526","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-27T16:22:42.000Z","id":"60e458a74ca6760046227d77"}]}}}
