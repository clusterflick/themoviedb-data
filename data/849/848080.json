Helen is informed that she has inherited her grandfather's millions, and she proceeds as quickly as possible to acquire expensive clothing and jewelry on credit. Jack, however, is not impressed. Soon Helen learns that she has inherited only $1,000, the remainder of the fortune having gone to her cousin Spindrift. The creditors hound her for their money, and at a grand ball at the Standring home, a detective threatens to arrest her. Touched by her poverty, Jack decides to elope with her. Finally Spindrift violates the conditions of the will, and Helen inherits the entire fortune.","popularity":0.107,"poster_path":"/zJorlNngBo5pEiUAuHzREZMSK8A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1918-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heiress For a Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Héritière d'un jour","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"A Herdeira Fingida","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Arvtagerska för en dag","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olive Thomas","original_name":"Olive Thomas","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/coDCGDmaICZjiBK8nReFerZ8Oja.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Helen Thurston","credit_id":"60e3baa807faa200485f1837","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3147356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe King","original_name":"Joe King","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jack Standring","credit_id":"60e3bb0f84591c002d70beb7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Burr","original_name":"Eugene Burr","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Spindrift","credit_id":"60e3bb264ca676002de27534","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1795627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Pettie","original_name":"Graham Pettie","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Old Hodges","credit_id":"60e3bb3e9974ee0026bcc2c5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Langdon","original_name":"Lillian Langdon","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/kOtKzUcdm9SChzXxyj29DfxGMQY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Standring","credit_id":"60e3bb5922e48000800d53ff","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1351510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Warren","original_name":"Mary Warren","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/zsujqK0DLQ48y3T1L96Ett76gQ2.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Grace Antrim","credit_id":"60e3bb6fcaa5080060ef1d1c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Dodge","original_name":"Anna Dodge","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/6gjFkcwkKKag9gKPjSvYIOhjUcf.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Rockland","credit_id":"60e3bb84258823004726bd25","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572904,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henry Albert Phillips","original_name":"Henry Albert Phillips","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e3ba728805510045d01ba0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Francis Dillon","original_name":"John Francis Dillon","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/8WWebUUEfcpcTvUNhFAeeoPRQbR.jpg","credit_id":"60e3ba3dcaa508002eff8df5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert F.
