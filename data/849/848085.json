In David's absence, his father hires a lawyer to convince Yvonne that David has abandoned her, and grief-stricken, she dies soon after her little girl is born. Yvonne's trusted friend Pierre rears the girl as a boy, whom he calls Toton, and trains her to become a skilled pickpocket. Meanwhile, David adopts a boy named Carew, and when he grows to manhood, the two move to Paris to establish an art studio. In robbing the studio, Pierre recognizes David, and to avenge Yvonne's death, he claims that Toton has been taught to hate her father. Later, Pierre becomes convinced of David's innocence, and before he dies, he reveals the truth to Toton. Finally, the girl is reunited with her father and marries Carew.","popularity":0.3386,"poster_path":"/5T0RVFJVALQVCn0RyrkMDSEDv4R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1919-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A gripping drama of love and life in Montmarte.","title":"Toton","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Toton the Apache","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Vital Spark","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"トトン","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Totó","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Yvonnes dotter","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olive Thomas","original_name":"Olive Thomas","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/coDCGDmaICZjiBK8nReFerZ8Oja.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Toton/ Yvonne","credit_id":"60e3c06326dac1007ed04d0d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Kerry","original_name":"Norman Kerry","popularity":0.1631,"profile_path":"/luQTt1kDR73AclpZeFeQPzPuhjc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"David Lane","credit_id":"60e3c0791e922500462c4fda","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis McDonald","original_name":"Francis McDonald","popularity":0.2683,"profile_path":"/5sIApbjJvZx0KvEDEk7BWKUuAeg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Pierre","credit_id":"60e3c08e26dac1005e3f8921","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1014834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Perrin","original_name":"Jack Perrin","popularity":0.1709,"profile_path":"/iHon1YovaxeKZrLM7ouj1B4k1ng.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Carew","credit_id":"60e3c0a325882300740c979c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Borzage","original_name":"Frank Borzage","popularity":0.2085,"profile_path":"/ban01OL4OFBDHsWkq4lEPWEtzbi.jpg","credit_id":"60e3bfcb84591c0074b4d3b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106106,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jack MacKenzie","original_name":"Jack MacKenzie","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e3c0096ee3d7002c2794ac","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2115667,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Catherine Carr","original_name":"Catherine Carr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e3bfed84591c0045c4258f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0010794","wikidata_id":"Q3532744","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5T0RVFJVALQVCn0RyrkMDSEDv4R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":578}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"LOST FILM","release_date":"1919-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
