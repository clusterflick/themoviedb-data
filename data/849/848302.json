Gnarly backcountry lines, street rails, natural hits and sculpted booters, road gaps, limited but top-notch park/pipe, mixed in with never-before-seen footage on a car tow-in parking lot step-down, snowmobile tow-in river step-up and acid drops from light towers and trees. High-end filming and clean editing make this DVD a must see. Riders featured include Jared McCrum, Ryan Johannesen, Lane Power, Nick Brown, Joanne Dzierzawski, Tim Barker, Mike Weir, and Chase Harriman.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/adFqYUKWX2xNSphjLv6nc6BLrB0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creative Differences","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1426,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/adFqYUKWX2xNSphjLv6nc6BLrB0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
