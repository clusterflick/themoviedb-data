Participating with the song’s antiphonal (call and response) form traditionally found throughout African and African American music, the lens of the camera is removed in unison with the rhythm of the choir’s chant back to the caller. This action is repeated for the duration of song which, corresponds to the 100’ length of film. As the turret of the Bolex swings away, removing any point of view dictated by the lens or the filmmaker, the light from the present that exposes the film, and the light from the past that is the subject of the song are brought into question.","popularity":0.0677,"poster_path":"/ccmWJlzLu1dGgk6elgMDKJFWrRY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mighty Bright Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Orlowski","original_name":"Robert Orlowski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e65037cd2046002dc65246","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ccmWJlzLu1dGgk6elgMDKJFWrRY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
