In response to an exponential increase in black bear-human conflicts – including bears breaking into cars and homes, and cubs getting trapped in garages – Colorado Parks and Wildlife commissioned a six-year study to determine the factors behind the state-wide trend, and to propose solutions to quell it. BEARS OF DURANGO invites viewers to consider their own regions and backyards, and how they can better cohabitate with the wildlife around them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/t4IHNX0by5W9g8G5JZHwlGFNf7Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156993,"logo_path":null,"name":"Test Area North","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bears of Durango","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3150554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heather Johnson","original_name":"Heather Johnson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60e75206cd20460046699c93","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3150556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dusty Hulet","original_name":"Dusty Hulet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e75318b76cbb00461ca4d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3150556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dusty Hulet","original_name":"Dusty Hulet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e75343a3b5e6005d944243","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12899360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t4IHNX0by5W9g8G5JZHwlGFNf7Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"International Wildlife Film Festival","release_date":"2018-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bears of Durango - The Cubs","key":"264361094","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-04-12T02:44:22.000Z","id":"60e7537fdf2945005ec87651"}]}}}
