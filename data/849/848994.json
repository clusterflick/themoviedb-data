The video compiles home video footage of family trips during the 1990s taken by her father, along with video materials of a senior Thai artist living in Amsterdam taken by Phromchanya herself. The senior artist, who is around the same age as her father, has been a subject of Phromchanya's work until his sudden passing in 2020. By layering these early years' memories with the struggles of dealing with the uncertainty of daily life, the video shares attempts of capturing the temporarily of the moment - and both beauty and unsettling experience of being elsewhere.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2020-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Though the Mountains Divide, and the Oceans are Wide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Belle Phromchanya","original_name":"Belle Phromchanya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e86cb7b76cbb00461eee24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin Art Week","release_date":"2020-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
