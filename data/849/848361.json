Michelle Brown, curator of illuminated manuscripts at the British Library, explains who made it and why, presents new findings about its dating, and shows how it unites a remarkable range of motifs and styles from the Celtic Iron Age, Germanic prehistory, ancient and Christian Rome, Coptic Egypt, and Byzantium. A wealth of other devotional objects and images from early Christianity are also featured.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/npuWb0Bv7BPxRlHoVdDbDztqu9r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67756,"logo_path":"/4ggDxQYubKHXt6gnJOwjE8pJd7J.png","name":"Illuminations","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World of the Lindisfarne Gospels","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/npuWb0Bv7BPxRlHoVdDbDztqu9r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
