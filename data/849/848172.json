Today, Marc is a worn-out man. Exhausted from running his church, which serves as a shelter, and overwhelmed by the bills they can no longer pay, Marc must face the facts: he will have to shut down his church. Like a call from Providence, he inherits a property in the Bas-du-Fleuve region and decides to take a group of homeless people with him, who, like himself, need a vacation.","popularity":0.6695,"poster_path":"/uf82hXCAZ6Rf6IRUz0lGMeUAWRu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46682,"logo_path":"/ybNfe9vMywnjygOODnm7QYw9rvQ.png","name":"Attraction
