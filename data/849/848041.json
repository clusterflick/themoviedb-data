The Oscarito trophy received by Flávio Migliaccio in 2014 Gramado Film Festival crowns a career enmeshed by many threads. Since Migliaccio has performed in different fields of art - from cinema and theater to literature and drawing -, the documentary creates varied visual interventions to enchain the narrative, in addition to the interviews and archive pictures, such as a shadow play to represent his humble childhood, and to the cartoons the artist drew to portray his existential questions in his ranch in Rio Bonito (State of Rio de Janeiro). Images and stories that aim to show a professional and personal life pervaded by possibilities and attitudes, both artistic and political.","popularity":0.0856,"poster_path":"/zWR88IluGGAplPk1uWYaXXaWyZj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127932,"logo_path":null,"name":"Afinal Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Migliaccio: O Brasileiro em Cena","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flávio Migliaccio","original_name":"Flávio Migliaccio","popularity":0.2511,"profile_path":"/x19FLdU2NbJUVGzol8m2ae8gakL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Flávio Migliaccio","credit_id":"60e37cb19974ee0026bb9d61","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2346862,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tânia Leite","original_name":"Tânia Leite","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e37cf707faa2003015e5fe","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404622,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tuco","original_name":"Tuco","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e37d04b76cbb002d414e2e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404622,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tuco","original_name":"Tuco","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e37ce2caa5080048e93bb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455162,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marcelo Pedrazzi","original_name":"Marcelo Pedrazzi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e37d2583ee670046f57d97","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3147216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Rocha","original_name":"Alexandre Rocha","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e37d156ee3d7002c26f94a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3147216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Rocha","original_name":"Alexandre Rocha","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e37cc56bdec3004602d6be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455162,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marcelo Pedrazzi","original_name":"Marcelo Pedrazzi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e37cd4caa5080048e93b81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12610576","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/10L5jv7nxUKI4zIr88Ew8rRJLxu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rG2fI09LIL7vQ05BGZGvVFL0LZ0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/zWR88IluGGAplPk1uWYaXXaWyZj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":279389,"name":"brazilian cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"14","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
