For Maine's tribal nations, the landmark legislation marked an end to a decades long struggle to educate the public of the harms of Native American mascotry. Fighting Indians chronicles the last and most contentious holdout in that struggle, the homogeneously white Skowhegan High School, known for decades as \"The Home of the Indians\". This is the story of a small New England community forced to reckon with its identity, its sordid history, and future relationship with its indigenous neighbors. It is a story of a small town divided against the backdrop of a nation divided where the \"mascot debate\" exposes centuries old abuses while asking if reconciliation is possible.","popularity":0.3526,"poster_path":"/rFehB4mudPgNePngVhaPII9VFI1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":234774,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stove Up Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fighting Indians","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3150668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maulian Dana","original_name":"Maulian Dana","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self -
