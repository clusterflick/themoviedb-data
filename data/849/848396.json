Silke was fostered out of the St. Mary, Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam at the age of 9 to the Killileas, a prominent political family from Tuam. Untold Secrets recounts her often brutal and abusive treatment at the hands of her foster family and reveals never seen before interviews with fellow survivors. Although Silke is now deceased the documentary gives a posthumous voice to Anne and possibly some closure to her family.","popularity":0.255,"poster_path":"/meCoTDE07YSlruyWo26mSbcjCDw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":208365,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nova
