However, class and caste differences prevent their marriage. Devdas is sent off to Calcutta, while Paro is married off to an aged rich widower. In Calcutta, as remorse drives him to alcohol, Devdas meets Chandramukhi, a prostitute. All Indian prints of this Bengali version were destroyed in a fire that ravaged New Theatre’s studios. Today, only one copy of the film survives which belongs to the Bangladesh Film Archives. Of that copy almost forty percent is destroyed.","popularity":0.3311,"poster_path":"/ezLr7QgVItfuqkYGQMYDneYC0nt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94372,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Theatres Limited","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1935-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE BENGALI LANGUAGE FILM ADAPTATION OF SARATCHANDRA CHATTERJEE'S NOVEL BY P.
