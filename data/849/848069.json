When he falls ill, however, the burglar's old cronies persuade Nell to help them in a bank robbery, supposedly to raise funds for their sick friend. Nell gets a job in the bank, and learns how to open the safe, but then she falls in love with Jim Brooks, another bank employee, and decides not to help with the robbery after all. The crooks try to force her father to insist, and when he refuses, they shoot him. Seeing their true colors, Nell forms a plan. She agrees to help with the robbery, but in the middle of the heist she calls the sheriff. Of course the story ends with the crooks in jail, and Nell and Jim in love.","popularity":0.1599,"poster_path":"/aYlk0NAYsDLFCTPa8nI8Qu9NU4E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25599,"logo_path":"/sPZZwYvN3xEGo7q8E9iYKrggjDz.png","name":"Famous Players Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Girl Like That","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2406857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Fenwick","original_name":"Irene Fenwick","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/a1C40uMkS5jM6Kwb2owVP9tyOVT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nell Gordon","credit_id":"60e3b2e0db154f001e65e7fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Owen Moore","original_name":"Owen Moore","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/6iBzyALpUaf22lKD2kRgzmsHGuC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jim Brooks","credit_id":"60e3b2f407faa200774ea2df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3147348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas O' Keefe","original_name":"Thomas O' Keefe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bill Whipple","credit_id":"60e3b315880551005d4327e5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Sturgis","original_name":"Eddie Sturgis","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Joe Dunham","credit_id":"60e3b32ca3b5e6004589e400","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":988348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Lee","original_name":"Harry Lee","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"John Gordon","credit_id":"60e3b34284591c002d70a827","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John T.
