Her life brightens when her cousin Lola comes visiting from New York. What she doesn't know is that Lola is fleeing a scandal that erupted when she was caught running around on her husband with her lover, David. It's not long before David comes looking for her, and Nancy falls in love with him. Lola sees a way out of her problem--if she can get Nancy and David to hook up, it will take the heat off of her. Nancy's aunts, who want to get rid of her, are all for the plan, and soon Nancy and David get married. However, things don't quite work out for everyone the way they planned.","popularity":0.4005,"poster_path":"/bxOeIoQ4ir7CDchXUuA30OmnODv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selznick Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1920-03-08","revenue":200,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fine Feathers Make Fine Birds, but the Sparrow is Happier than the Peacock","title":"Youthful Folly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Glorious Youth","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olive Thomas","original_name":"Olive Thomas","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/coDCGDmaICZjiBK8nReFerZ8Oja.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nancy Sherwin","credit_id":"60e3cd3407faa200485f440d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crauford Kent","original_name":"Crauford Kent","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/zYq9Z283YTCX5FYaG59nVs598TD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"David Montgomery","credit_id":"60e3cd4d6ee3d70046c05830","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1432793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Gill","original_name":"Helen Gill","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/pfgHVT2sEWPChIXQbYFQhkcEv91.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lola Ainsley","credit_id":"60e3cd644ca676002de2a273","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":133276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Huntley","original_name":"Hugh Huntley","popularity":0.0549,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jimsy Blake","credit_id":"60e3cd8d6ee3d7007540e017","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Craig","original_name":"Charles Craig","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Reverend Bluebottle","credit_id":"60e3cdb022e480002def6e70","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Truesdale","original_name":"Howard Truesdale","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":"/3x1oVSTclTV1wQPEcruUWUVDoBc.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Jonathan Ainsley","credit_id":"60e3cdd322e480002def6ec4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1322273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florida Kingsley","original_name":"Florida Kingsley","popularity":0.332,"profile_path":"/p7aL4G2HwxPXXdd33WpfS06yGZK.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Aunt Martha","credit_id":"60e3cde9caa508002effb95f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugenie Woodward","original_name":"Eugenie Woodward","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Aunt Jenny","credit_id":"60e3cdfe84591c0074b4f6d9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2248114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Dempsey","original_name":"Pauline Dempsey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Mammy","credit_id":"60e3ce1083ee670046f64370","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1353751,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jules Cronjager","original_name":"Jules Cronjager","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621b47d47776f0001b87ca36","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1015688,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Lynch","original_name":"John Lynch","popularity":0.0931,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e3ccf18805510045d04b6c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Crosland","original_name":"Alan Crosland","popularity":0.1133,"profile_path":"/jqvqh7gg871bgsQxaZH0pJqtkue.jpg","credit_id":"60e3ccd35e14e50073450eed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olive Thomas","original_name":"Olive Thomas","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/coDCGDmaICZjiBK8nReFerZ8Oja.jpg","credit_id":"60e3ccffb3f6f5005c56355e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":789,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bxOeIoQ4ir7CDchXUuA30OmnODv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":525},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":872,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gKewCWZNbxUU19PFl090cCT38l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":654}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"LOST FILM","release_date":"1920-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
