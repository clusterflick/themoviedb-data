Featured are our first attempts at making videos on 'Baby Blue Eyes' and 'Halfway To Paradise'. Surprisingly, videos were not even thought of in our Epic days. Also included is our own effort on 'Outa My System', recorded for less than a hundred quid, surely the cheapest video ever shown on MTV. Mostly however, you have the band in its element, playing on stages throughout the world. There is footage from the U.S.A., Europe and, of course, home in Britain.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/mUWwEOiNEuwgpCwiDIhj2mFUTUX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Vibrators: 1976-2004","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mUWwEOiNEuwgpCwiDIhj2mFUTUX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1048}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
