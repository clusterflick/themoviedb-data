And this home is always shaped by nature. Today, we human beings change and shape this more than any law of nature. HEIMAT NATUR is a visually stunning journey through the nature of our homeland, from the peaks of the Alps to the coasts and the depths of the North and Baltic Seas. In between is a cinematic foray through steaming forests, shimmering moors, over rose-blossoming heaths and the colorful cultural landscape around our villages and towns. In extraordinary images this nature is shown from its most beautiful side, examining the state of the native habitats. Slow-motion and time-lapse photography as well as intimate shots of familiar and unfamiliar species, some filmed for the first time, making the film a cinematic nature experience for the whole family.","popularity":0.361,"poster_path":"/nJyibxiHsjgCoVPQNqTBgeREjpb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95582,"logo_path":"/9PjjDGprhnleFFg7HSUK7Nfmfuk.png","name":"Nautilusfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":233595,"logo_path":null,"name":"FFF
