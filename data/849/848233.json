The documentary by Radio Bremen shows the moving life story of the soccer star of the 1950s in a torn Europe and how an enemy became a friend. With his legendary appearance in the English Cup Final 1956, in which he played until the end despite a broken neck, Bert Trautmann set up a memorial for himself in the history of sport. Already in the same year, he is chosen as England’s footballer of the year, and by his club Manchester City even as best player of all times. Bernhard “Bert” Trautmann is one of the most popular and best-known soccer players in England.","popularity":1.1661,"poster_path":"/64KjZA1ZNTDJhPm9PVRBE3j8vYg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bremedia
