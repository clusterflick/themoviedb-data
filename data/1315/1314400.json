Jodorowsky and Marianne Costa start from the public reading of the Tarot, to heal\" with their psychomagical advice and dispense ingenious tales that, through laughter, lead us toward deep reflection. For this is the atmosphere one breathes in the company of Jodorowsky, in the theater as well as in his home in Paris, where he tells us about himself in a long and intense interview-conversation. He talks to us about autobiographical memories, his relationship with other art forms and the Tarot de Marseille, which he personally helped restore, and about the profound and unique idea of Planetary Man, an idea that knowledge of the Tarot can help us develop.
