The documentary also features his last partner Paula Yates speaking on British television for the first time about what she believed led to the death of her lover. She talks candidly about their sex life, his passion for adventure and how the birth of their daughter turned the rock and roll wild man into a devoted father. Yates was not satisfied with the coroner's verdict and felt strongly that further investigation into the events of that night were crucial to both her and her daughter's future well-being.","popularity":0.7059,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":202527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Just Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Excess: The Death of Michael Hutchence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel West","original_name":"Samuel West","popularity":1.0188,"profile_path":"/bn1nd5zERi5wyHcA1YMGvrHAD5L.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"668c6cd4ab3ebf63a2fc591b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Hutchence","original_name":"Michael Hutchence","popularity":0.1568,"profile_path":"/fu14gRAVKoe00zsJUrMQ559OHRa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"668c6a710eb06dd35df33d38","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1243630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Yates","original_name":"Paula Yates","popularity":0.106,"profile_path":"/qSNnaOv4Epg0gonSzSyYRHsqFFC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668c6a7d94b821d904fc5902","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1452870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Egan","original_name":"Nick Egan","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/5qPn8eqMv90sZGKRYFYmvQ88sC0.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668c6dcd88314b5239fc591e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kell Hutchence","original_name":"Kell Hutchence","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668c6de1d454ced3eb9cc38f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4809641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhett Hutchence","original_name":"Rhett Hutchence","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668c6df11ef94fdcb3f33d48","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4818937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard M.
