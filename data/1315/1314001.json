Her political commitment and participation in supporting the clandestine struggle, beyond being a virtue, were a direct and almost biological part of it. Ziuta had the determination, being just a teenager, to resist exile with fortitude, saving her mother and another family from perishing in flight. Despite the horrors and hardships, she maintained a grateful attitude toward life. These characteristics, and her particular sense of humor, permeate her story, even in chapters with painful themes: the death of her father, her madness; her suicide attempt in the Caspian Sea and her decision to come to Mexico, where she rebuilt her life and lived with artists, writers, dancers and filmmakers at a time of great cultural effervescence in the country, even participating as an actress in some films. .","popularity":0.1388,"poster_path":"/pmX8aXMAZOUgipnjBeKr9fEMkGm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88619,"logo_path":"/AoD0uPFA6R8J7XVGNkTNFmqfhyu.png","name":"Fondo Nacional
