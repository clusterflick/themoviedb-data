Facing barrel down, sporting Adidas harder than a French rapper, the gym-fit speaker slams. Then jumps. Then it’s serious. Then it’s slow. A one-take wonder work spouting Bow Wow, campaign jargon, LP is couples therapy - the couple being City vs State, the limo speaker acting as Jennifer Melfi. Post Lovesick Puppy screening I asked Justine Youssef for her influences. The response: ‘do you do this with all films you watch, build webs with others?’ Beyond a one-take web, Justine tangles people to places - especially places being bashed up by fucking developers.  This work was commissioned by Utp as part of Dream Sequence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lovesick Puppy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3072901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justine Youssef","original_name":"Justine Youssef","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668c96567679d9959a5bfbe0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
