These members have not only a cultural obligation to oversee the protection of the island but also honour what is the largest Aboriginal deaths in custody site in Australia. They have their own attachment to the island but collectively they understand the crucial role that Aboriginal culture plays within the island; spiritually, cosmologically, historically and politically.
