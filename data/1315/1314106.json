These daily routines are captured in the film Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (Chantal Akerman, 1975) over a period of three days. Similarly, this videographic essay takes the viewer through three stages in the cycle of the extension of the housewife logic into the sphere of the digital. It proceeds from introducing the evolution of reproductive labour, to a playthrough that foregrounds the connections between reproductive and cognitive labour in the datafied society, to a demonstration of how this development of housework turns us all into ‘digital housewives’.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zLsiT8ZYF647l5s3an5aBer4VRa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cycles of Labour: In the Metaverse, We Will Be Housewives","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4816856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Veronika Hanáková","original_name":"Veronika Hanáková","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b090f7f392210f0ae420c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4816859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Tremčinský","original_name":"Martin Tremčinský","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b0924a788552570e5b184","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4766609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jiří Anger","original_name":"Jiří Anger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b0942a3c0821bfaae41d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zLsiT8ZYF647l5s3an5aBer4VRa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
