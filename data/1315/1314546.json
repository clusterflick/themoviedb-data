Re practice: aversion to bad (scripts) with desire for good (impulse).  Marianne Williamson claims to do an hour of meditation before a morning scroll to avoid brain fog. Sione’s meditation is the scroll; the brain fog is worth it. Their wish fulfillment, improvised moviemaking proves film isn’t just healing, but healing can spread via film - a maximalist medium of abundance. When you ditch planning you end up with life (sad that I’m quoting the fucking Beatles) but Sione’s is a life worth living. We assume this compels them to film eeeevvvveeeerrrryyythingg, and by way of IG stories for max exposure. From crispy chicken tenders, to touching the microphone foam in a studio (forbidden!) life is good. Don’t plan.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3329689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sione Monu","original_name":"Sione Monu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668c9692a31ed000cb168b48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
