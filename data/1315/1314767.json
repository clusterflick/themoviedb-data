What inner experience do we hide from others? In a double hand gesture, Claire Denis reminds us at the same time of Jean-Luc Godard (1930-2022) and of the actor Michel Subor (1935-2022), who played in four of her films and with whom Denis also remained closely connected in private. Denis juxtaposes a scene from Godard's Algerian war film LE PETIT SOLDAT (1960/63) with a miniature from her hypnotic work BEAU TRAVAIL, wherein she directly quoted Godard's scene in 1999. Michel Subor starred in both films.","popularity":0.0694,"poster_path":"/oEdx4daYtylXx65xd0yEUl68K9e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE TRAILERS OF THE 60TH VIENNALE","title":"Le Soldat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Denis","original_name":"Claire Denis","popularity":0.6102,"profile_path":"/GAQ2QlfhskTqXzgLMfPOTlPEbu.jpg","credit_id":"668d5cb6261375a2e9aa4765","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1490,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oEdx4daYtylXx65xd0yEUl68K9e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":993}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Viennale-Trailer 2022: LE SOLDAT by Claire Denis","key":"olHq8M9JqD0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-10-21T10:53:41.000Z","id":"668d5cd1baea718612d5874a"}]}}}
