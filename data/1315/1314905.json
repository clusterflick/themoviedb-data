While they are among the most important indie bands of this century, they have perhaps never been more popular than they are today. Their recent collaborations with Taylor Swift, who cites them as her favorite group, or with Phoebe Bridgers have allowed them to reach new audiences. Last year was one of the most important for the Cincinnati group, which released two LPs in quick succession and was voted group of the year by Forbes newspaper. Their immaculate discography now includes ten albums and as many reinventions of their signature sound, imbued with sometimes raw, sometimes sophisticated arrangements, and the sensual baritone voice of Matt Berninger. The National will perform for the third time in Montreux, after a concert at Miles Davis Hall in 2008 and at the Montreux Jazz Caf√© in 2012.","popularity":0.5025,"poster_path":"/4KqWGXsxQTPsZy0ZyzYuNjZ5i0X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The National - Live At Montreux Jazz Festival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Berninger","original_name":"Matt Berninger","popularity":0.1541,"profile_path":"/rMop8KCMrNhN3QIesNU0yKLdimR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"668dcc4f10d1adeb524229a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931139,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aaron Dessner","original_name":"Aaron Dessner","popularity":0.2043,"profile_path":"/60nKfvqCs2A97D5KFdsLVtYXiwG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"668dcc55c5ed94a002f36773","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931140,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bryce Dessner","original_name":"Bryce Dessner","popularity":0.3685,"profile_path":"/z2IGco48V4aX2GbshjKmfv2idRJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"668dcc5ed274ab760f0a2cc0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":931143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Devendorf","original_name":"Scott Devendorf","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":"/wiunlYPCcPGyaU4vUzQtm9VzsgG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"668dcc66275c062a93d5896c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":931142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Devendorf","original_name":"Bryan Devendorf","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":"/f6Ze7XOE4cz7oux2C59AU8yqgsc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"668dcc75eaafae55aeae123e","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4KqWGXsxQTPsZy0ZyzYuNjZ5i0X.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
