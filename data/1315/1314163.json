He started in Kaliningrad with a collaboration with Adidas, moved to St. Petersburg to launch a partnership with Burberry, and recently presented in Yekaterinburg, referencing Boris Yeltsin and Russia's 2018 World Cup. His latest collection, featuring backgrounds by artist Erik Bulatov, emphasized youth unity and anti-establishment themes. The event, held at the Boris Yeltsin Presidential Center, was more of an art performance than a conventional fashion show. Collaborations with Levi's and Dr. Martens symbolized togetherness and defiance against political divides, resonating with the young generation globally.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hciwXZzj8GgzzoxZkXFi2yBp27P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gosha Rubchinsky 18 A/W","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2964465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gosha Rubchinsky","original_name":"Gosha Rubchinsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"668c40b097952224669f6dd8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2964465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gosha Rubchinsky","original_name":"Gosha Rubchinsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668b3cdfe73e6bd869205f99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2964465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gosha Rubchinsky","original_name":"Gosha Rubchinsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668c40e65edb199e4275116e","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4239068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Bulatov","original_name":"Erik Bulatov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668c410735d859cb64d8c4c4","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hciwXZzj8GgzzoxZkXFi2yBp27P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Gosha Rubchinsky 18AW last collection","key":"rpWJKJYTsc4","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-11-22T04:52:28.000Z","id":"668b3c9d90c809787099fd4d"}]}}}
