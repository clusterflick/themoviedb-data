Hear directly from survivors and descendants of the massacre as well as community advocates on how over 100 years later the destruction of Greenwood continues to ripple through individuals, families and entire communities. To secure a brighter future, we must reckon with the whole truth of our history. This allows us to address the damage of white supremacy from its foundation and ultimately achieve freedom and equality for all. This film was made in collaboration with Justice for Greenwood.","popularity":0.0916,"poster_path":"/mP58G12nhdb0piqzXxoAXkslZgN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greenwood Is Still Burning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32573977","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mP58G12nhdb0piqzXxoAXkslZgN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
