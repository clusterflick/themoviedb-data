Up to 18 m high, the two climbers are keen to work the route without a rope. The Piade site appears in the first minutes of the film “La Vie Au Bout Des Doigts” by Jean-Paul Janssen. At a height of 15m, after several summers of work, Olivier is one of the rare local climbers to have completed this route. Today, it is Christian who is taking on this same challenge. The two climbers are keen to work it without the help of a rope. After each fall, they must start the route from the beginning. Guided by his elder, the film recounts Christian's progression and success on the path. It is also the story of their friendship and the joy they share together, suspended, “at their fingertips”. Determined, Christian works the route in summer, as in winter, despite the sometimes unpredictable conditions.","popularity":0.3208,"poster_path":"/dJPC7oRYh7eyA7qSFCVS0HCNpl5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":233439,"logo_path":"/1EiHlPYr8wO9N1zccp5d6vv877z.png","name":"Studio Piton","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":233441,"logo_path":"/fAMeDngPJ5cuWYIMj1RZczczZDf.png","name":"Chateau Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Une Araignée au Plafond","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4821251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Locastello","original_name":"Christian Locastello","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668dc8711d55e0fac40a2ca1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4821254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivier Letourneux","original_name":"Olivier Letourneux","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668dc8a02e94b909d0d5899f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4821210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adelin Benard","original_name":"Adelin Benard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/lUR0yCr1ilhxrYEydJAkuZWhuZG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668dc8b6b8c36d9419efee51","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3843535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Exertier","original_name":"Robert Exertier","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/sw25HvfjiOfHszbv4hy0U1c7VAo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668dc8c0275c062a93d5895e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Edlinger","original_name":"Patrick Edlinger","popularity":0.1189,"profile_path":"/4mBvYOBQAiIwg7oCXjxIxtnImYW.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"668dc8cf918da6fbc60a2cb9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4821210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adelin Benard","original_name":"Adelin Benard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/lUR0yCr1ilhxrYEydJAkuZWhuZG.jpg","credit_id":"668dc52ad2f414d85665980f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4821210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adelin Benard","original_name":"Adelin Benard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/lUR0yCr1ilhxrYEydJAkuZWhuZG.jpg","credit_id":"668dcc89dc4dc3bf3aae1238","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4821210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adelin Benard","original_name":"Adelin Benard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/lUR0yCr1ilhxrYEydJAkuZWhuZG.jpg","credit_id":"668dcc91c281cff22d6b0a6a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32879442","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A0hAljfEzcMgaCOqafzETe3I7Iu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dJPC7oRYh7eyA7qSFCVS0HCNpl5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oy55DgPbnmAcwOXMt93cqjGftHH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":197623,"name":"free climbing"},{"id":272233,"name":"escalade"},{"id":299422,"name":"french climbers"},{"id":300554,"name":"solo climbing"},{"id":334603,"name":"psychobloc"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Une Araignée au Plafond - Trailer","key":"LVq7Ke9Z98I","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-01-17T10:23:41.000Z","id":"668de279f3c52c63890d3216"}]}}}
