Within days of the discovery of Jason's body, the hunt was on for the killer of another boy, later identified as 6-year-old Barry Lewis.  The bodies of both boys showed traces of the kind of tranquillisers commonly used by paedophiles. Leads from Wandsworth prison eventually revealed that the ring may have been involved with as many as 20 murders of young boys. Next week's programme reconstructs the painstaking follow-on investigation called Operation Orchid.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/iDOLR1KrUC36X04mePrrQ71HuqL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7710,"logo_path":"/iJQIjE9g4FqCDPLzxqoOfQ0e4Xx.png","name":"BBC One","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crimewatch File: The Lost Boys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3337496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Ross","original_name":"Nick Ross","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self  - Reporter","credit_id":"668e025984deebad76c21f75","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1646674,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bridget Sneyd","original_name":"Bridget Sneyd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668fc4713f188051172c25df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12002162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iDOLR1KrUC36X04mePrrQ71HuqL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1994-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
