Devoted professionals who played their hearts out and gave their all for 'the jersey'.\r TRUE BLUES is packed with action and profiles of each of these dedicated individuals, as they talk us through the most memorable moments of their Rangers careers (who could forget the Celtic match when Graham Roberts took over in goal after Chris Woods was sent off?)  However all of these players have one thing in common - they were committed to the Club, bound by an overwhelming sense of tradition. They will be remembered as players who had Rangers in their souls - the True Blues.  Profiles on Ally McCoist, Mark Hateley, Richard Gough, Andy Goram, Terry Butcher, John Brown, Ian Ferguson, Davie Cooper, Graham Roberts, Stuart McCall, Graeme Souness and Ian Durant.","popularity":0.2294,"poster_path":"/ogkNJY63A2b8mtfjkNq6S1azzDv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":233437,"logo_path":null,"name":"P.T.
