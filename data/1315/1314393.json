After graduating from the Khiva Madrasa, the poet Pyragy (Feraghi) Magtymguly returns to his native Turkmen aul. He teaches children, composes poems, loves a beautiful girl and is loved by her. But local bey Cherkez-khan does not like the poet's calls to unite Turkmens, and his soldiers burn the village. Khan appoints the captured Magtymguly his court poet but, having received a refusal, the tyrant orders to kill the poet. But the guard helps the poet to escape. Having returned to the burnt aul, Magtymguly begins to call on Turkmens to unite with Russia, because they could not deal with their troubles alone.","popularity":0.0764,"poster_path":"/blVMisnIA3y5hV315T6w6smo9Su.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30312,"logo_path":"/nze2tJ20u0mwHJLlFf0MryBSSI6.png","name":"Turkmenfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkmen","iso_639_1":"tk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magtymguly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khommat Mullyk","original_name":"Хоммат Муллык","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/59QvEecMga5JWipybaVMezPtrGb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Magtymguly","credit_id":"668c3010db831218a4ca28b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1840527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muhammed Cherkezov","original_name":"Muhammet Çerkezow","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/5qNyGlt4wf4DUF7QGOatcnu2zu0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mergen","credit_id":"668c303b6276ca046546d893","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4818601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gyuldzhan Dovuletmuradova","original_name":"Gyuldzhan Dovuletmuradova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mangli","credit_id":"668c311b6becb1e67b860315","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4818602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iva Kakabayeva","original_name":"Iva Kakabayeva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Zubeyda","credit_id":"668c3142f8fd91799786032b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3153873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ata Alovov","original_name":"Ata Alowow","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/tIjqnlsBtKRpy3GZUYcRh7Q64u0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ovez","credit_id":"668c3161a3c0821bfaae656a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4818603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"N.
