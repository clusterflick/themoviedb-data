His poor wife did nothing but drudge, with no return other than an existence. One day, a young man stops at the farmhouse to get a drink of water. He imagines from her sad face that all is not as it should be, and tells her that her eyes are too beautiful for tears and her hands too delicate to carry the burdens set for her. The husband sees and hears and is at last made to realize that her life, without the sunshine of love, is but a little better than death, and so he makes a change for the better.","popularity":0.1539,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Lesson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
