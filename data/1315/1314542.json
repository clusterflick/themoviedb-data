Is there anything to say or film? And sometimes it’s more substantial with more direct discovery, creativity and accountability than anything that was made with years of processing, and meetings, and money stress, and creative differences. The real gauge for artistic relevance in 2021 is whether anyone cares about your early-Covid responses. Archiving monotony and mediocrity is all a part of survival. Last year when moments of connection were severed, a document of someone just being was life saving. So while Vlog Dreams is basically a Bhenji cough track, it’s also a safe space.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9XDEprY1coGbv87tm5g4Yj7mJZX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vlog Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4819161,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bhenji Ra","original_name":"Bhenji Ra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"668c9479ea90452806168c38","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3221070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Shannon","original_name":"André Shannon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668c946e9d1b57031f5bf946","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4819161,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bhenji Ra","original_name":"Bhenji Ra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668c9460ebd36fadf5168919","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9XDEprY1coGbv87tm5g4Yj7mJZX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
