This is a psychological analysis of the great maestroâ€™s otherworldly nature, about which we have often not dared to speak. This is a man who was hailed as a genius, accused of being gay, and dismissed as a clown. A man who was considered too commercial by some and sacred by others. The film also contains the complete material filmed by Sergei Parajanov for his final, incomplete movie, Confession. The film also contains his own confession as to why he shut down that project and left his final work incomplete.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/7ZMshMCl9gwt3IQ5LMaNuaJk0Ns.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Boogeyman","title":"Bobo (The Boogeyman)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ZMshMCl9gwt3IQ5LMaNuaJk0Ns.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
