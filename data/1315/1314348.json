He is looking for a musical truth...  What if Mozart's masterwork Don Giovanni had been interpreted in a wrong way for more than two centuries? Conductor René Jacobs, famous for his performance of Così fan tutte and laureate of a Grammy Award for his innovative recording of The Marriage of Figaro, comes back with new ideas on the comprehension of one of the greatest operas of all times.  In this relevant documentary, Nayo Titzin clarifies and highlights all the brightness of those melodies and recitatives. Rewarded with many praises in the international press, this production shows the dramaturgical perfection of the \"opera of the operas,\" the absolute of the genre, as Wagner once said. Once more, the Bulgarian director offers a fun and subtle report, and makes sure that everyone will understand this myth.","popularity":0.2758,"poster_path":"/zQy1nnDcap7AGwYJrjYWIvM6LHl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":233311,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spotlight Production
