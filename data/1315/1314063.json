In those years, Toni Kukoč became Europe's most popular basketball player and was also officially voted the best player of the old continent four times. The journey from Split, from elementary school to winning an NBA ring and sharing the locker room with the greatest basketball player of all time, Michael Jordan, is a story about growing up, fellowship, and socializing with generations that only knew about winning during those years. He played and won Olympic medals for two countries, Yugoslavia and Croatia. Regardless of his incredible sports results, what sets Toni Kukoč apart is his behavior off the field, his modesty and his sincerity.","popularity":0.3433,"poster_path":"/mkI9t5gUpGh3V85ronGySuDv3Le.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":233236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Symposar Sarajevo","origin_country":"BA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"release_date":"2024-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magical Seven","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1837077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Kukoč","original_name":"Toni Kukoč","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668ae72e90c809787099e688","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renata Kukoč","original_name":"Renata Kukoč","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668aeba877c3318c99204911","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Jordan","original_name":"Michael Jordan","popularity":1.8809,"profile_path":"/tCqjwlROe98wYbcRhCcp3qYsUc5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668ae739e98ae355c7ae40fe","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4816582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Božidar Maljković","original_name":"Božidar Maljković","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668aeb588e68cec3db204910","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2154103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svetislav Pešić","original_name":"Svetislav Pešić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668aeb612df02a508a0fb298","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4816590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Željko Pavličević","original_name":"Željko Pavličević","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668aec1b586abf44fd860cd8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoran Savić","original_name":"Zoran Savic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668aec29228667ac23ba3312","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2154107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luka Pavićević","original_name":"Luka Pavićević","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668aec4170f99d8d9de5b051","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2490328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Wennington","original_name":"Bill Wennington","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iWFzK6JuOpNJOB7IkY3cHJogdFo.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668aec56b5429be957eac386","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2154104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dino Rađa","original_name":"Dino Rađa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668aec622cfce023b7e5b060","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4816596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Žan Tabak","original_name":"Žan Tabak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"668aec69506a97005c860ced","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3366063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabahudin Topalbećirević","original_name":"Sabahudin Topalbećirević","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ae7151534ba03b6eac354","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3366063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabahudin Topalbećirević","original_name":"Sabahudin Topalbećirević","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ae71d35447bba27b134d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mkI9t5gUpGh3V85ronGySuDv3Le.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
