Thelma lets Zazu drive. When she brakes to avoid a bull pulled along by three rustics, her foot gets stuck and the car crashes through a barn. The barn's owner won't let them leave without paying damages. The gals hoof it, walking in a large circle to arrive back at the farmer's house after dark. While outside his door, they hear a radio broadcast to beware a lion escaped from a wintering circus. Can Thelma and Zasu reclaim the car while avoiding the angry farmer, his prize bull, and the renegade lion?","popularity":0.371,"poster_path":"/2QQgoGb0xRFJKxGHRXY7JcDzef.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Old Bull","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zasu Pitts","original_name":"Zasu Pitts","popularity":0.3131,"profile_path":"/yzz6JRsLsmciHcsv7lEigYy2cEy.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Zasu","credit_id":"54c0df70925141243200148e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thelma Todd","original_name":"Thelma Todd","popularity":0.2588,"profile_path":"/pXImIsfL2n0AXFB5fPWj3nb7fKK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Thelma","credit_id":"54c0df81c3a368789b0015a8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Fries","original_name":"Otto Fries","popularity":0.1185,"profile_path":"/iavhijBHJxpCNjXFstoKWRuunNk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mr. Bailey - Farmer","credit_id":"54c0df969251416eae00a456","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Burns","original_name":"Bobby Burns","popularity":0.1846,"profile_path":"/nNp9JFUKAb9k30YzgKaIX5zjSCq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Farm Hand (uncredited)","credit_id":"54c0dfae9251416eae00a465","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131383,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"H.M.
