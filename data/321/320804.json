During a squall at sea, Idomeneo -- the king of Crete -- swears to Neptune that if the monarch survives, he'll sacrifice the first person he encounters onshore. Tragically, that person ends up being his son, Idamante (Frederica Von Stade). Maestro James Levine masterfully conducts the orchestra and chorus of the Metropolitan Opera.  A musical production that was designed for the \"Live From the Met\" series, this program was produced by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle.","popularity":0.845,"poster_path":"/awmnKWzamLgUPBPCi4EKvEe6kPc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":185,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idomeneo","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luciano Pavarotti","original_name":"Luciano Pavarotti","popularity":0.2707,"profile_path":"/p9TlGSfQ4NNW54TL16zOe9gvXJx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Idomeneo","credit_id":"57949ac4c3a3687709002977","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Alexander","original_name":"John Alexander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Arbace","credit_id":"57949ade925141136a003aa6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hildegard Behrens","original_name":"Hildegard Behrens","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/f5CEcs4Io43A8cPgzr3imxvWWRD.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Elettra","credit_id":"57949aecc3a3687709002984","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ileana Cotrubas","original_name":"Ileana Cotrubas","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/seremgRpsF5TSUrGjj8N1zJ7WIV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ilia","credit_id":"57949af7925141797e0012a7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1028317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederica von Stade","original_name":"Frederica von Stade","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/gp6C54Aw1s6kxBm0eFsOyPSWLi.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Idamante","credit_id":"57949b049251414204002788","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Jenkins","original_name":"Timothy Jenkins","popularity":0.1186,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"High Priest","credit_id":"57e437e4c3a368759c0088f0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1314753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loretta di Franco","original_name":"Loretta di Franco","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Women of Crete","credit_id":"57e438129251411df10051b2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Batyah Godfrey Ben-David","original_name":"Batyah Godfrey Ben-David","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Women of Crete","credit_id":"57e4382e9251411d7d005245","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":190825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Anthony","original_name":"Charles Anthony","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Trojan Soldiers","credit_id":"57e43845c3a3687589007193","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Courtney","original_name":"James Courtney","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/olNxjayI7iK6OCGu7eRj46klwvr.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Trojan Soldiers","credit_id":"57e43862c3a368759c008951","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard J.
