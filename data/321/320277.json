One of the most successful of these was her 1955 film version of Mussorgsky and Pushkin's Boris Godunov. Stroyeva's adaptation deftly streamlines the story of a Russian czar whose life is placed in jeopardy by a pretender to his throne. A. Pirogov sings the title role, while G. Nellep provides vocal and visual menace as the \"False Dmitri\". The use of a color process known as Magicolor adds just the right touch of theatrical artificiality to the pomp-and-splendor proceedings.","popularity":0.1441,"poster_path":"/vGG7eacM3sPO7FkI6blniyWKxYI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1954-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boris Godunov","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandr Pirogov","original_name":"Aleksandr Pirogov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Boris Godunov","credit_id":"5bb37ed70e0a263dff00e584","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2140018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikandr Khanayev","original_name":"Nikandr Khanayev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Vasili Shuysky","credit_id":"5bb37ee60e0a263e0500d85d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5260413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgi Nelepp","original_name":"Georgi Nelepp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Grigori","credit_id":"67b7e3f121d4708b60eb2e11","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxim Mikhaylov","original_name":"Maxim Mikhaylov","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/f2tYBoFiMHdmHxMphRQZmvQsoyk.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Pimen","credit_id":"67b7e4b0bc84d56cbeba3f93","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":566713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Kozlovsky","original_name":"Ivan Kozlovsky","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":"/vYsEtiHdUgMb4VuHc2GRxtiWTSS.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"The Fool","credit_id":"67b7e56bbc84d56cbeba40a2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1728243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larisa Avdeyeva","original_name":"Larisa Avdeyeva","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Marina","credit_id":"67b7e5c27434200c28225366","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":566711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vera Stroyeva","original_name":"Vera Stroyeva","popularity":0.2108,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54c09054925141315a0031aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2604629,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Zoya Moryakova","original_name":"Зоя Морякова","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/qHc29vmVbL2lSjU4faTvnvzgYzz.jpg","credit_id":"658c4329e2102301491fafb3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"VFX Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2604646,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Nikolay Zvonaryov","original_name":"Николай Звонарёв","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667d1da9ed2c184e438d0114","department":"Visual Effects","job":"VFX Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2338667,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikolai Renkov","original_name":"Николай Ренков","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/a6e4G4NlU29mWmCpQk9HtXDBsWL.jpg","credit_id":"60129b4fdd83fa003f9c0af8","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects Camera"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0052642","wikidata_id":"Q4093750","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vGG7eacM3sPO7FkI6blniyWKxYI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":700},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7fV2ctIM3D5tRnBEVOzsNLvUkWJ.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1954-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
