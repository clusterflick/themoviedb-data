She hosts a talk show called In Touch With Insanity. The idea behind the show is that insane people should have the right to express themselves, regardless of what society thinks of them. Viewers call in and speak to Linda's various personalities about their own insanity and how they live with it. If they need help she refers them to the doctor who is treating her. Unbeknownst to Linda, viewers of her show are being murdered. Is the murderer a psychopathic viewer? The doctors? Or one of Linda's own personalities?","popularity":0.3572,"poster_path":"/xqL0Bc9BBdfWUtiWQlkllKiUXKv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schism","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynn Lowry","original_name":"Lynn Lowry","popularity":0.4997,"profile_path":"/2G2z7AYgkZf35aF946BSSeJfOfp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Betsy / Jackie / Lola","credit_id":"590258ccc3a3684066003a4e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1805257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Youngren","original_name":"Robert Youngren","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Fuller","credit_id":"590258ec9251410a9b003bca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Tracy Keijser","original_name":"Janet Tracy Keijser","popularity":0.2083,"profile_path":"/EK0azYzV0fuuT7uVhcnLnL1KbF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"590258fec3a36841070035d5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Nelson","original_name":"Joshua Nelson","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":"/6Bm3x0QPdwEY3F3xBAic22iRHsB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jonathan","credit_id":"59025912c3a3684090003bc4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1805259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Polina Gorman","original_name":"Polina Gorman","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/lO1Af1ZKX0qPcyYu6lyhfDGB5sW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sally","credit_id":"590259269251410ab4003bff","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1805262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Griffin","original_name":"Emily Griffin","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/vQWfP978WB2EOBysU1MzQTuUQw0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Judy","credit_id":"590259c8c3a3684066003b29","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1805252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Susan","original_name":"Lauren Susan","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/necAfhP722zxxGSi1NNkh2890MA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Stacy","credit_id":"59025a7b9251410a91003dca","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lloyd Kaufman","original_name":"Lloyd Kaufman","popularity":0.5372,"profile_path":"/4jNIqeZBK2YbpPupBhl4l1moQn5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Crank Caller","credit_id":"5a12acbb92514138e706c8db","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rik Billock","original_name":"Rik Billock","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Linda's Father","credit_id":"5a12acc8c3a368628f065ed1","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynn Lowry","original_name":"Lynn Lowry","popularity":0.4997,"profile_path":"/2G2z7AYgkZf35aF946BSSeJfOfp.jpg","credit_id":"628713babf09d100529427a4","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1805255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek Purtell","original_name":"Derek Purtell","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628713cd3d745400ac56ba65","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3556612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erika Purtell","original_name":"Erika Purtell","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628713db6c84920065b8c9fc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1805255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek Purtell","original_name":"Derek Purtell","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628713d3209f180066ba30af","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1805255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek Purtell","original_name":"Derek Purtell","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590258b09251410ab4003b87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1242685","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xqL0Bc9BBdfWUtiWQlkllKiUXKv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
