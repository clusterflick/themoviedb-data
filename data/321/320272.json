The principal characters are a pair of twin lighthouse keepers. They try their best to live together with their wives under the same roof, but the delicate balance is shattered when one of the brothers falls in love with his sister-in-law. When one twin is lost during a storm, the other assumes his identity, with the expected romantic complications. If Despues de la Termenta sounds familiar, it is because the screenplay was inspired by the 1946 Bette Davis vehicle A Stolen Life.","popularity":0.5765,"poster_path":"/3lgQ379kjQbY3LoCEZimZxcE5Mi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95205,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pydasa","origin_country":""},{"id":95206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmadora
