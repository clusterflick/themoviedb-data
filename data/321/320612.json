Music:Jin Wang. In making the film noir drama The Fifth Night, Yang used different lenses for each camera, but filmed everything at the same moment, creating a labyrinthine, live-feed effect. The work recalls the narrative structure of a traditional Chinese hand-scroll, while its multiple perspectives are suggestive of an M. C. Escher drawing. The synchronous scene was captured in a single take, with the work running for 10 minutes and 37 seconds, the exact length of a reel of film.","popularity":0.0569,"poster_path":"/1BdyFMzGaPufEOyfgVvidw21XXD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fifth Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yang Fudong","original_name":"Yang Fudong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mQpTNmXXJ6LdVTJqGCEZX8kCMlE.jpg","credit_id":"54c204c3c3a368789b0033ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1BdyFMzGaPufEOyfgVvidw21XXD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
