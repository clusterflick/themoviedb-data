Lala Khurana is the uncrowned king of Delhi and he runs it with the help of a Member of Parliament, & the Director General of Police. His advocate Chintamani Chaubey wants him to contest the next elections, ensuring his win, and making his own laws, appointing his own police officers, who will do his bidding, carrying on without any checks and balance. Khurana likes this idea, but feels he is getting too old, but would like his son, Devendra Kumar, to run and be the next State Chief Minister.","popularity":0.1412,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tejasvini","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"N.
