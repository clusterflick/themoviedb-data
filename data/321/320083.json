The fights are sudden snorting seesaws, explosions of mass and muscle, archaic and wild spectacles. We follow three concurrent story lines: an anxious farmer with his beloved contender, a neurotic unemployed reporter from Zurich coming to find a story, and a gang of adolescent boys on mopeds trying to catch a pretty girl's eye. The festival is a balancing act between fascinating tradition and modernity. This black and white film serves as both an exciting visual treat and a long overdue documentation of a fascinating Swiss tradition.","popularity":0.102,"poster_path":"/8sgPa67ZC9dW3MudHXSebIpu1Xq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Battle of the Queens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1318673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Steiner","original_name":"Nicolas Steiner","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb5b263e375c00020fd58fd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1318673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Steiner","original_name":"Nicolas Steiner","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb5b22cbbe1dd00217fd6f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1786533","wikidata_id":"Q106718723","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/xbReaKtivwepsNHRjxxITIj2S8M.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/cI5qbaPASgZxesjnJmOkPSdkUra.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1482,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8sgPa67ZC9dW3MudHXSebIpu1Xq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":989}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
