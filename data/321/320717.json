It connected New York City with San Francisco and passed through towns and cities in 13 states. It was an adventure for early motorists, and drivers today still love its hidden charms and all the stuff along its several paths.  A RIDE ALONG THE LINCOLN HIGHWAY considers some of the history of the road and shows some of the joys of finding and riding along the various alignments of the highway today.  Along the way, we meet highway historians and enthusiasts from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Evanston, Wyoming, and many places in between.  We check out the cottages at the Lincoln Motor Court near Bedford, PA, stop for lunch in Mount Vernon, Iowa, meet some folks in Eureka, Nevada, and even walk out to the end of the Berkeley pier in California. It's a great trip.","popularity":0.0821,"poster_path":"/kfxYBxHg9K85Hc0xVCJLx8hpAZC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16021,"logo_path":"/2bjAiWiyI4nUWzxLcnGejDO0amC.png","name":"WQED","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Ride Along the Lincoln Highway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Sebak","original_name":"Rick Sebak","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/8eYRrrzkY9co4nza7gP0hPwQ9Tb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5df71d4265686e0018865e31","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Sebak","original_name":"Rick Sebak","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/8eYRrrzkY9co4nza7gP0hPwQ9Tb.jpg","credit_id":"5df71d8f26dac1001453d4d7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2483387,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Glenn Syska","original_name":"Glenn Syska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df71e8fd1a89300197b3984","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2103062,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kevin Conrad","original_name":"Kevin Conrad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df71eea65686e0018865f89","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2053837,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Jarrett Buba","original_name":"Jarrett Buba","popularity":0.1175,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df71e2265686e001386c10e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2483386,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Buddy Nutt","original_name":"Buddy Nutt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df71e7c65686e0015868f25","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Sebak","original_name":"Rick Sebak","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/8eYRrrzkY9co4nza7gP0hPwQ9Tb.jpg","credit_id":"5e26171d41eee10017fa764b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655865,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Bob Lubomski","original_name":"Bob Lubomski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece2a49e4b576001f2a804e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1941442","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kfxYBxHg9K85Hc0xVCJLx8hpAZC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5DzsmTiWVMLg0nYAsIzWrBytJPs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1044}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9935,"name":"travel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Ride Along the Lincoln Highway","key":"-qxuB3YGvkY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2008-07-01T16:05:11.000Z","id":"5e0eb13768188800165898ec"}]}}}
