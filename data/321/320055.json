How do they handle the constant pressure to be popular? Where do they turn for support? These are just the few of the issues addressed by Yellow Roses. Yellow Roses weaves together sound bites taken from hours of interviews with young women from various areas of the United States. The result is an honest, humorous, gritty and sometimes shocking look into the everyday lives of ordinary girls. Yellow Roses doesn't just focus attention on the often troubling dilemmas that confront today's young women. It also communicates that they are loved and accepted, just as they are.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yellow Roses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1673540","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
