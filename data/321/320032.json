Without a job and without a family, he returns to his hometown of Freiburg. While looking for work at his old club, the EHC Freiburg, he meets Benny, whom he once coached. Benny has come a long way as a joke item manufacturer. But Benny is always plagued by the uncertainty about the identity of his father. When Benny discovers that Harry is left-handed like him and has the same allergies, he is convinced that Harry must be the long-awaited biological father. Benny, in turn, is completely taken aback and ultimately misses the right moment to explain the misunderstanding to Benny. Instead, Harry soon enjoys having a son and no longer being alone. Benny now finally has the father he always wanted.","popularity":0.2637,"poster_path":"/fY0TWpaJApNenu9mnLWpZ7ouzDE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zeit der Zimmerbrände","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uwe Ochsenknecht","original_name":"Uwe Ochsenknecht","popularity":0.5515,"profile_path":"/mlNKDWmAxUIqLT4ZfW1REo7MoOD.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Harry Zoppke","credit_id":"54bf6963c3a368145e00d355","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Letkowski","original_name":"Christoph Letkowski","popularity":0.3995,"profile_path":"/xpyB4F3qyTaDehpgzSlgEQCAXoz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Benjamin Hinz","credit_id":"54bf696e9251416e60008485","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Lou Sellem","original_name":"Marie-Lou Sellem","popularity":0.3098,"profile_path":"/cXwOyBqKVlt10aQBy6idstUM4vH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anna Alpino","credit_id":"54bf697bc3a3684046009f43","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jytte-Merle Böhrnsen","original_name":"Jytte-Merle Böhrnsen","popularity":0.1735,"profile_path":"/clJDT5w0RMRezgJusyIUej1hKgt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Britta Hasenkamp","credit_id":"54bf6987925141315a001033","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petra Zieser","original_name":"Petra Zieser","popularity":0.1981,"profile_path":"/wo5yDKQEdWOOZiG9adA0334huCT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tante Lisa","credit_id":"54bf698fc3a3686c6100e4f2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanette Hain","original_name":"Jeanette Hain","popularity":0.616,"profile_path":"/hfE2fjdms4XW1LZphRQ1JwFoha7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Eve","credit_id":"54bf6994c3a3687c40008ad9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leopold Hornung","original_name":"Leopold Hornung","popularity":0.1931,"profile_path":"/cleGeHDug8U49tF3eBrhvNheqYr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Daniel Schlösser","credit_id":"56d379d1925141799e00dc31","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1714020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Sarkis","original_name":"Rolf Sarkis","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/rq5l6Soy1AVc07dDCERCyGYtSj2.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Erwin Wolatschek","credit_id":"5c704c34c3a3682478df444d","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49010,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivian Naefe","original_name":"Vivian Naefe","popularity":0.13,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54bf69a6925141315a001036","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4259774","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fY0TWpaJApNenu9mnLWpZ7ouzDE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/treyLUVtGNUFao6z71bNSFMmdTR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2014-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
