This cruise club offering freedom, unprecedented sex and apparent absence of judgement has the film director constantly pushing his own personal boundaries, bringing out a side of him he didn’t know existed. Is it healthy and can he deal with the freedom? In this personal documentary the maker explores what Club chUrch means to him, while his late great–uncle, who was also gay, seems to watch over his every move. Robin Vogel bares all in a film about sexual identity, non–monogamy and bridging different worlds.","popularity":0.0965,"poster_path":"/eiP8CTIxwEubGRAV42bMcUNhGV5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"chUrchroad","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"chUrchroad: Weg van de kerk","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2318244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Vogel","original_name":"Robin Vogel","popularity":0.63,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6104d6dc7d5f4b005e87e76c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2318244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Vogel","original_name":"Robin Vogel","popularity":0.63,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104d6858ee49c004658a325","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2318244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Vogel","original_name":"Robin Vogel","popularity":0.63,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104d68b4f33ad002d9046ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2318244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Vogel","original_name":"Robin Vogel","popularity":0.63,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104d6bc688cd0002f3a7c2e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2318244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Vogel","original_name":"Robin Vogel","popularity":0.63,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104d6c3a3770a007e0e73f5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440589,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bart van de Lisdonk","original_name":"Bart van de Lisdonk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104d6d423d278004611e02c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6150898","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kVlOEqLTr0HhOrAVKJMBvhS7k30.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eiP8CTIxwEubGRAV42bMcUNhGV5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":709}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Roze Filmdagen","release_date":"2016-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nederlands Filmfestival","release_date":"2016-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
