Mrs. Cherwak is Polish and owns a cow. Mrs. Meuser is a German with entrenched notions of cleanliness. She does not appreciate the cow's inevitable by-product. The film describes their conflict and its curious resolution over coffee and mincemeat pie. While the author chose to write about the Germans and the Poles she grew up with on the outskirts of Regina, the situation she describes could apply anywhere in the world.","popularity":0.1137,"poster_path":"/m72ygiYIVrq3YSIlHpEAKbmh3JJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1004740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Leaf","original_name":"Caroline Leaf","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/lcQl4BSKtup40DVc6sdeR6EKcuo.jpg","credit_id":"64e7856d5258ae014df1c730","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sheldon Cohen","original_name":"Sheldon Cohen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2uiuvnZPb3JxGanW1ax5CvdG2st.jpg","credit_id":"59639c2cc3a36825e80e4851","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1004740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Leaf","original_name":"Caroline Leaf","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/lcQl4BSKtup40DVc6sdeR6EKcuo.jpg","credit_id":"59639c359251410b860f885f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sheldon Cohen","original_name":"Sheldon Cohen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2uiuvnZPb3JxGanW1ax5CvdG2st.jpg","credit_id":"59639c21c3a3680d590ce50f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0227263","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m72ygiYIVrq3YSIlHpEAKbmh3JJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/YnXYzl3HZx7YHFkmLVgUMehxNj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
