The work consists of three short sections intended to represent what is “playing” in each of the theaters. These include richly layered montages of the Old West and pop-culture imagery, as well as art and film celebrities who appear as phantom stand-ins to embody the specters of the Cowboy and of Sarah Winchester herself.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/90auDzTRVxtvkJhW6YC9z8hIN1r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Century 21","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1846985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Blake","original_name":"Jeremy Blake","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596066b6c3a36828a10c4ad2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/90auDzTRVxtvkJhW6YC9z8hIN1r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
