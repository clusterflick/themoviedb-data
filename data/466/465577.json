The Washington-based CITES treaty, in which Japan participates, puts a limit on the number of warships any country can possess. As a result, Japan has to decommission a ship to its makers' disappointment. An institute of technology's laboratory designs a new ship. Due to less ships, sailors have to retire and are also disappointed. The laboratory's manager and an admiral are visiting a patient at a hospital and meet coincidentally. The former has a daughter who worries about her father's workload. She asks him to accompany her to a concert. Father has little time, but is convinced for her sake. He is inspired for a ship's design at the performance. The film is inspired by the life of Jo Hiraga.","popularity":0.2691,"poster_path":"/nMfgRcYVnuRezLBgJSWueXX8qOk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":882,"logo_path":"/fRSWWjquvzcHjACbtF53utZFIll.png","name":"TOHO","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1944-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cruel Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Ikarî no umi","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Angry Sea","type":"translated"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denjirō Ōkōchi","original_name":"大河内傳次郎","popularity":0.2484,"profile_path":"/yegq1bccLpW4ZRCRTuzOGBhBpSM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"596399e79251415a400c6dac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Setsuko Hara","original_name":"原節子","popularity":0.6696,"profile_path":"/zaiy9COvjUVGV6q9x7ptuZeuTCa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"596399f2c3a368265d0ef91c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seizaburō Kawazu","original_name":"河津清三郎","popularity":0.4154,"profile_path":"/l6d2AdjkG59E35X1snJWrt4oph2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"596399ffc3a368265d0ef928","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":134402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hisako Yamane","original_name":"山根寿子","popularity":0.2001,"profile_path":"/e6Sc1HiiJST1BtafRPmEBX1jxCo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"59639a199251410c560ecf3c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1334610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ichirō Tsukida","original_name":"月田一郎","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":"/8LFkAKViMO79kKAqMHCN5dQjY8C.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"59639a24c3a3680dec0cf7a4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1078234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chieko Murata","original_name":"村田知栄子","popularity":0.1515,"profile_path":"/n6BYv72iJgdTJAaMo8JSEBx8hES.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"59639a55925141790405af62","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tadashi Imai","original_name":"今井正","popularity":0.2479,"profile_path":"/ukqQGR7cObdTC3l6FiwK19YN13a.jpg","credit_id":"596399b892514122510d5ec4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6347808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1402,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/nMfgRcYVnuRezLBgJSWueXX8qOk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":938}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
