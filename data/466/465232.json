Ranging from the revisiting of a scene of Ming-Liang Tsai's 'Vive l'Amour' through the eyes of its protagonist, to a ticker-tape parade in Buenos Aires, from a reflection on the filmic qualities of Brasilia,to an observation of the observers of the 1999 eclipse in Paris. All soundtracked by a sensitive balance of field-recordings and carefully chosen delicate music.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Park Central","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster","original_name":"Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster","popularity":0.0517,"profile_path":"/sFLxrClQwuOsrvlw0W5xsQO6Vr5.jpg","credit_id":"5961613c9251410a590c42be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
