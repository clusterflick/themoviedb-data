It is the White Continent... Antarctica.  Featuring the Antarctica Peninsula, South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, Antarctica Dreaming documents all major Antarctic and sub-Antarctic animals. Their lifecycles captured over an entire season of varying climate conditions, from wild white blizzards to fire red sunsets reflected in a glassy sea.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1Azlcm5GUvbOUToNJOIXRkfbv6O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Wildlife on Ice","title":"Antarctica Dreaming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Azlcm5GUvbOUToNJOIXRkfbv6O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
