Halfway around the world, however, the fighting is still going strong on a small island in the Pacific. Okinawa was the site of the last battle of the last great war of the 20th century, with a casualty rate in the tens of thousands. Through it all, military cameramen risked their lives to film the conflict, from brutal land combat to fierce kamikaze attacks at sea. See the footage they captured and experience this intense battle the way the soldiers saw it -- in color.","popularity":0.6445,"poster_path":"/9Heg0z0P6tJ2P3eIuupqGYvZxDF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18894,"logo_path":"/rFr30k0B8DgdZtPHjzAtQIJ3XDH.png","name":"Smithsonian Channel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Battle of Okinawa in Color","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1757339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Wilburn","original_name":"Jeff Wilburn","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/tMHMeAw2vCrG1RNpPwOT59Zsr5W.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"67b69162fea8f116b33afdfd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5258329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr.","original_name":"Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Commander of the U.S. 10th Army (archive footage)","credit_id":"67b6916d99998623c11480a9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chester W.
