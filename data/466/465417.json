He recently lost his older brother to the war in Syria, and now lives with his family in a Lebanese refugee camp. Traumatised, overwhelmed, disengaged, he prefers to be silent. Director Soudade Kaadan’s patient observation accompanies Ahmad, as he recovers a sense of childhood lightness despite his grief. Amid endless images of violence, the film poses a question about the future, and in Kaadan’s words, “explores the impossibility to verbally express what is happening in Syria now.”","popularity":0.1017,"poster_path":"/lwP4z1XiYQxFe6Pgu7DUCaOQqFR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Obscure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1848112,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soudade Kaadan","original_name":"Soudade Kaadan","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":"/2EawdmARJr8lnmwmR8ynKS9fO5N.jpg","credit_id":"59624d00c3a3680dec0b10b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q52391327","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":759,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lwP4z1XiYQxFe6Pgu7DUCaOQqFR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
