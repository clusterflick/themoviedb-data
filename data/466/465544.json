Sticking with the habit of a lifetime,  he’s going to say it as he sees it.\r This is the tale of a young Dublin boy raised in the inner city markets area,  a gifted teenager who signed for the Busby Babes two years before the Munich Air disaster, who grew into one of the most revered names in English soccer with an all conquering Leeds United team.  It is the story of a father figure of Irish soccer who went on to manage for club and country and who with Eamonn Dunphy became one of the most memorable double acts in the history of Irish television.  This documentary looks at key moments and memories in John’s life. In Ireland, locations will include his childhood home in Ormond Square in Dublin’s market areas, the famed Dalymount Park and the Wexford beaches where John and his family spent their holidays.  In the UK, John visits the iconic Old Trafford,  as well as making a trip to a crucial Leeds United game at Elland Road.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/r8cmTkFEuQPl1ZlW3RfhnR500OZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92287,"logo_path":null,"name":"LOOSEHORSE","origin_country":""},{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÉ","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2017-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The legendary football man tells his life story in this candid new documentary","title":"GILES","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1674899,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Murphy","original_name":"John Murphy","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/oLMXX4xKelZBg6X4GzSTMth0uY0.jpg","credit_id":"680624fec3e8e74b6dee466c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/td6IQVqSLT8Pgiq6RJmIJZMwKxv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vGG54iFZwjXkUSouSjCQ2hruuy0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r8cmTkFEuQPl1ZlW3RfhnR500OZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Giles | 9:35pm Monday 3rd July 2017 | RTÉ ONE Television","key":"T4VO6sxK0_A","published_at":"2017-06-29T11:39:17.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"596346f9c3a3680dec0c89d9"}]}}}
