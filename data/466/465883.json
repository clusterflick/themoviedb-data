Part Benny Hill part Joseph Beuys the work is as much a performance piece as it is a exercise in Samuel Beckett parody.  In the re-make Kötting's protagonist is a woman moving very slowly within the almost identical landscape to exactly the same soundtrack. Married up edit for edit with the original super 8 footage, Kötting sees the work as a digital artefact dug up and re-presented as a split screen 33 years after the event.","popularity":0.0962,"poster_path":"/6E3g7TtrWYEt2qAId1p6KODbTid.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Klipperty Klöpp Split Screen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Kötting","original_name":"Andrew Kötting","popularity":0.2099,"profile_path":"/trIfQwhe7BsJpgqpTCdXsMxBtv3.jpg","credit_id":"5964e05a92514122510eed98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6E3g7TtrWYEt2qAId1p6KODbTid.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: http://www.andrewkotting.com/ak%20web/klippertyk2.html","release_date":"2017-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
