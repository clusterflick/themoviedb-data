In the re-make Kötting's protagonist is a woman moving very slowly within the almost identical landscape to exactly the same soundtrack. Married up shot for shot with the original super 8 footage, Kötting sees the work as a digital artefact dug up and re-presented 33 years after the event.","popularity":0.1875,"poster_path":"/7IQaOo8xbpVrlQB2lSs5HwCnaLd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Klipperty Klöpp 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3241903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yumino Seki","original_name":"Yumino Seki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61492d48c2823a0044e07887","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Kötting","original_name":"Andrew Kötting","popularity":0.2099,"profile_path":"/trIfQwhe7BsJpgqpTCdXsMxBtv3.jpg","credit_id":"5964d36cc3a368265d107bef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7IQaOo8xbpVrlQB2lSs5HwCnaLd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: http://www.andrewkotting.com/ak%20web/klippertyk2.html","release_date":"2017-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
