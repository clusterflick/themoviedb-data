Rozle becomes the village priest, Mojca goes to work in the city, Bedanec becomes a village dormitory, Kosobrin is a slightly more modern herbalist, and Kekec remains a shepherd, but only slightly grows. Through all the narrative, Kekec wants, and he is very determined, to marry in a short time with Mojca, who is entrusted with his director Feri. A couple of times, they crash into Kosobrin's village after a drop of Mojca's painful eyes. Kosobrin and Bedanec still do not understand best. Bedanec still wants to get rid of Kosobrin's mysterious recipes and Kekec still protects him, but with increasing problems. Kekec's decisiveness, courage, and strength were broken by his unheard-of love towards Mojca. All this illness can only relieve the true flower.","popularity":0.2334,"poster_path":"/aTzUxzO71pRItgy2lJMHIoEK9W3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":82887,"logo_path":"/mf1lq6q33uE5sMxn5gVmr0osGlM.png","name":"UL AGRFT","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2012-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kekec: Three Days Before the Wedding","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":549981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katarina Čas","original_name":"Katarina Čas","popularity":0.5188,"profile_path":"/F5sG3kWJWm5eayCdIhu8jzJQym.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Mojca","credit_id":"59623ad99251410a590d62c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matjaž Javšnik","original_name":"Matjaž Javšnik","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/sl3cWy2OuhPap0P2L9r3fWziOIB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kosobrin","credit_id":"59623aef92514122510b8410","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miha Brajnik","original_name":"Miha Brajnik","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p34XyoPbqUa2nRYw9hbe1qMlFVD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kekec","credit_id":"59623b0892514122510b842d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1526142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damir Leventič","original_name":"Damir Leventič","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bedanec","credit_id":"59623b1ec3a36825e80c85f1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandar Rajaković","original_name":"Aleksandar Rajaković","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7piESiOCGaVjXjwu2SE9z9CEby4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Feri","credit_id":"59623b32c3a368253c0c12ec","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vito Košir","original_name":"Vito Košir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rožle","credit_id":"59623b4292514121f00bb780","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873139,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marko Kurat","original_name":"Marko Kurat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59998f88c3a36821c802909f","department":"Writing","job":"Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873140,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jaka Šuligoj","original_name":"Jaka Šuligoj","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59998f92c3a3680f4e01ddcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873139,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marko Kurat","original_name":"Marko Kurat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59998f9c9251413ff6013cb3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873141,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Goran Kužet","original_name":"Goran Kužet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59998fba9251416396012dad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873140,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jaka Šuligoj","original_name":"Jaka Šuligoj","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59998fc19251413ff6013ce2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5167948","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTzUxzO71pRItgy2lJMHIoEK9W3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sl","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
