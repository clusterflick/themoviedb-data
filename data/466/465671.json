As the only documentary footage from inside the Twin Towers, the film is a gripping minute-by-minute account of that harrowing day through the lens of French filmmakers and brothers, Gédéon and Jules Naudet, and firefighter James Hanlon.  The 2016 edition features a new intro from Denis Leary, who is closely aligned with advocacy for first responders. The updated material focuses on the ongoing health issues that 9/11 firefighters have battled, and the inspiring stories of “legacy kids” — women and men who lost loved ones in the attack and have since become firefighters.","popularity":0.6426,"poster_path":"/avdprUAnagm2hwCzMVbxsOd7TtJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5881,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silverstar Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":29605,"logo_path":"/bSjv2Cinm8LoadffAngaQek4WLW.png","name":"CNN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9/11: Fifteen Years Later","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"911 Fifteen Years Later","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hanlon","original_name":"James Hanlon","popularity":0.2096,"profile_path":"/LKWIxng8blmcgypa8UROtSbF7b.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cfe273ec3a368019a1e5cc7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Leary","original_name":"Denis Leary","popularity":1.3696,"profile_path":"/9pMR9QhURdJ3xxdHeNVOKF5M81b.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"611deaec85c0a2002a514092","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gédéon Naudet","original_name":"Gédéon Naudet","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611deb04ca8354002e058977","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules Naudet","original_name":"Jules Naudet","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611deb0cf03174002c9ebe76","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hanlon","original_name":"James Hanlon","popularity":0.2096,"profile_path":"/LKWIxng8blmcgypa8UROtSbF7b.jpg","credit_id":"611dead2cca7de002ab2621e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules Naudet","original_name":"Jules Naudet","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59bd883ac3a3681bd4017e14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gédéon Naudet","original_name":"Gédéon Naudet","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b113de1c3a368621d0168a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hanlon","original_name":"James Hanlon","popularity":0.2096,"profile_path":"/LKWIxng8blmcgypa8UROtSbF7b.jpg","credit_id":"5cfe2759c3a3680cac1e620d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hanlon","original_name":"James Hanlon","popularity":0.2096,"profile_path":"/LKWIxng8blmcgypa8UROtSbF7b.jpg","credit_id":"5cfe27730e0a261fbbca17dd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7168902","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t44pJ62MmGH6G5WMkuiaF17nnNq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/avdprUAnagm2hwCzMVbxsOd7TtJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"CNN","release_date":"2016-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
