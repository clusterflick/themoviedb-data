The show was broadcast every Saturday night from a theater made up to look like an old barn, in the Compton suburb of Los Angeles. The guest list was a \"who's who\" of country, rockabilly, and rock 'n roll. Here's incredibly rare footage of Eddie Cochran filmed Feb. 7th, 1959. This DVD includes a rare interview with Cochran, and he performs C'mon Everybody, Have I Told You Lately That I Love You, Don't Blame It on Me, Summertime Blues, School Days, Be Honest with Me, Money Honey and others.","popularity":0.2883,"poster_path":"/9aevNhcADvwfhG6sFsHEa8cwEL3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92343,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bear Family Records","origin_country":""},{"id":92341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bear Family Germany","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eddie Cochran at Town Hall Party","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Cochran","original_name":"Eddie Cochran","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/ditFb2I9oCsdw0S7xFMRwsOi81H.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"596510ed9251410a59110d49","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849404,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William Wagnon, Jr","original_name":"William Wagnon, Jr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596513cbc3a3680d590ec15d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849405,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Allen","original_name":"Richard Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596514049251415a400e408c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hcmTlq399dpOaJYBCZroacsM7mr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w3ODlPeBumNHbXZ9T3GTuofwtcT.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9aevNhcADvwfhG6sFsHEa8cwEL3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":578,"name":"rock 'n' roll"},{"id":6552,"name":"rockabilly"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
