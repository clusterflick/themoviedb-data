Five years in production took Director Jennifer Abbott across Canada, the US, Australia and New Zealand to meet with the leaders of the animal rights movement, animal welfare advocates as well as spokespeople from livestock industries. A Cow at My Table inter-cuts these diverse perspectives with archival films, images from modern-day agribusiness and footage of farm animals shot from uncharacteristic vantage points.","popularity":0.5002,"poster_path":"/wEFOfJNpFp6p1ykaJAo1f8ydTip.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74659,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flying Eye Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cow at My Table","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Kitchen","original_name":"Susan Kitchen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself - Alberta Foundation for Animal Care","credit_id":"5962044992514122510b48a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Schafers","original_name":"Susan Schafers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself - Holborn Poultry Farms","credit_id":"596204b89251415a400a4392","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joy Ripley","original_name":"Joy Ripley","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself - Alberta Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals","credit_id":"596204cec3a36828a10e993b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Duncan","original_name":"Ian Duncan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself - Centre for the Study of Animal Welfare","credit_id":"596204e39251410bfa0d8eee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1847836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Bauston","original_name":"Gene Bauston","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gfLDd61q6S531Rtkn7VOFKzLwlp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - Farm Sanctuary","credit_id":"596205b6c3a36828fc0c0707","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeannette Armstrong","original_name":"Jeannette Armstrong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself - Activist, Writer","credit_id":"596205cac3a3680d590aaf66","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Davis","original_name":"Karen Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself - United Poultry Concerns","credit_id":"596205e79251410a590d277f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":149288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vandana Shiva","original_name":"Vandana Shiva","popularity":0.2463,"profile_path":"/knwbovedVTC2cAEXjVLvRGWgrUa.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"596205f292514122510b4a94","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol J.
