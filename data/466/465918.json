The result is a diverse, assertive collage, ranging from advice on how to seduce a librarian( in silence, of course), to the importance of short hair in visibly proclaiming your lesbianism and deafness: plus an essential beginner's guide to sexual signing. Shot entirely in British Sign Language with subtitles for the hearing.","popularity":0.1185,"poster_path":"/ll2UriimN8InKJ8DDK5J9LsAzae.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frameline","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1992-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Actions Speak Louder Than Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Kwietniowski","original_name":"Richard Kwietniowski","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/hXXOBxKHrfEjXKMhJx2xkYKMq4g.jpg","credit_id":"5964ff46c3a36828a112cc00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0136693","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ll2UriimN8InKJ8DDK5J9LsAzae.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
