The artists’ research crosses four bodies of water — the Mediterranean sea; and the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans — to connect four disparate islands: Lesvos, Haiti, Marshall Islands and Tiwi. Each island holds within it stories of tremendous violence, but also the potential for otherwise. The film assembles fragments that touch on a kind of knowledge embedded in a moment preceding human history or geological timescales — a moment of total entanglement described by the artists as Deep Implicancy. In excavating the link between geological shifts and material realities, they ask: can an earthquake release the knowledge for a revolution in the very way we know the world?","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/dY2UjxzGgfrYgq3PZhgIy6ZfSO7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"4 Waters: Deep Implicancy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2030847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arjuna Neuman","original_name":"Arjuna Neuman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643b0afe2ea6b9051750e9c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2030848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denise Ferreira da Silva","original_name":"Denise Ferreira da Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d82e2adc490480221d14ea6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pseY03SJoSQ1VFGCQD1kL8HknW8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dY2UjxzGgfrYgq3PZhgIy6ZfSO7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
