Gallery in New York features a riveting performance by Wilke, who is nude (except for high heeled-shoes) and aiming a gun. As she stalks the performance space like Emma Peel crossed with an exotic dancer, two cameramen follow her, recording her every movement. Dissonant music and a voiceover text about art, violence, power and gender provide the aural counterpoint to her often provocative physical gestures.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So Help Me Hannah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1876993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Wilke","original_name":"Hannah Wilke","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8638d322f5d70018a89cbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1982-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
