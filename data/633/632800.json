The neglected bus system, which still handles 91% of all transit riders,is now roughly as efficient as travel by burro.\" Academy Awardâ€“winning cinematographer and director Haskell Wexler (Medium Cool, Latino) has now fashioned a new documentary tracing three years in the life of a group of bus-rider activists passionately engaged in the struggle to bring affordable, safe, and adequate mass transit back to their city. What might at first sound like a well-intentioned but rather parochial subject for a film has resulted in a truly inspiring lesson in how working-class, predominantly minority citizens forge an effective social movement and how, like Rosa Parks and the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycotters of the 1950s, a group of committed individuals can successfully challenge the powers that seek to control their lives.","popularity":0.1864,"poster_path":"/A8P2mxfznk5ZxR9KseAkI4EX5it.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bus Rider's Union","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2415441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Della Bonner","original_name":"Della Bonner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d8569c722f5d70020a73f02","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2415442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kikanza Ramsey","original_name":"Kikanza Ramsey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d8569d3b76cbb001fde3eee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2415457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Mann","original_name":"Eric Mann","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d85716ce78e2d0029738471","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7067,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Haskell Wexler","original_name":"Haskell Wexler","popularity":0.2954,"profile_path":"/k3JSEg2tildKuFl6F6T1gLQSwgf.jpg","credit_id":"62bbff20097c49005148ceef","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johanna Demetrakas","original_name":"Johanna Demetrakas","popularity":0.0938,"profile_path":"/kl0Qzqr2xpV19VsJZB4pJWJKo6B.jpg","credit_id":"5d8569b9e78e2d00217369d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7067,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Haskell Wexler","original_name":"Haskell Wexler","popularity":0.2954,"profile_path":"/k3JSEg2tildKuFl6F6T1gLQSwgf.jpg","credit_id":"5d8569aa006eee00173450a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0229283","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.599,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A8P2mxfznk5ZxR9KseAkI4EX5it.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":599}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Chicago International Film Festival","release_date":"2000-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
