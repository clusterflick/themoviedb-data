In an emotional and hard-hitting documentary, he finally goes public about his condition. He reveals how hiding the truth about his health left him feeling depressed and contemplating taking his own life. Now he is on a journey to change perceptions about HIV by raising awareness, fighting prejudice and taking on the biggest physical challenge of his career - running the world's toughest Iron Man. With the help of family, friends, medical experts, and others with HIV, he sets about tackling the stigmas, myths and misunderstandings surrounding the condition. Modern medicine may have made the virus treatable and non-transmittable, but old ideas about HIV persist and Gareth is on a mission to smash the stereotypes and show that 'he has HIV and it's OK'.","popularity":0.3387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4762,"logo_path":"/cey5EAFwOb7AfDOsQ4p4q5MixzX.png","name":"BBC Cymru Wales","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gareth Thomas: HIV and Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1953770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gareth Thomas","original_name":"Gareth Thomas","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":"/bhU4RrSo9l2XsXLPiTz6ZpKGboS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d82a900869e75002e0c5f4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samantha Womack","original_name":"Samantha Womack","popularity":0.557,"profile_path":"/bvOnVGapPivDTqfIpjpMNZGCeww.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d82a90a09c24c001eb65657","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1953825,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Allen","original_name":"Sara Allen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6638f41de92d83012ad43072","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3005735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jody Cusack","original_name":"Jody Cusack","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6638f42c5ed8e9012b156ff4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1953825,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Allen","original_name":"Sara Allen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d82a8e1f6787a00269e5ccb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968119,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ian Durham","original_name":"Ian Durham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d82a8eed34eb3002450a720","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11058442","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
