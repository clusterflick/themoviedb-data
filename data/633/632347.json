But forward 25 years into in the midst of a nationwide purge on the nation’s nightlife, where nearly half of all British clubs have shut down in the last decade, and a new kind of scene has emerged.  Clive Martin investigates this 21st century version of Rave, where young people break into disused spaces with the help of bolt-cutters and complicated squatting laws, to suck on balloons and go hard into the early morning.  But with the police using increasingly extreme tactics to clamp down on these parties, and more than one fatality causing nationwide media panic, can the scene survive?","popularity":0.4083,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17209,"logo_path":"/khOQX3iJuSmaFWrL3w4LijbtnJZ.png","name":"VICE Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Britain's Illegal Rave Renaissance","title":"Locked Off","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3221,"name":"rave"},{"id":33088,"name":"rave party"},{"id":155418,"name":"subculture"},{"id":182266,"name":"rave culture"},{"id":207379,"name":"electronic music"},{"id":257788,"name":"gabba"},{"id":257791,"name":"club culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Britain's Illegal Rave Renaissance: LOCKED OFF","key":"h3t3YnVgY9k","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-05-23T10:13:42.000Z","id":"5d82ec5d9e4586025994206d"}]}}}
