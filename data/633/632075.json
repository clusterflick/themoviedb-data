Since ancient times, they have negotiated their own unique relationship with their natural surroundings.  Acclaimed photographer Masa-aki Miyazawa discovered the essence of that ancient way of living in Ise Jingu, Japan’s holiest Shinto shrine. Inspired by the idea of sending a message to the future in the same way this ancient shrine keeps alive the traditions of the past, Miyazawa used an ultra-high resolution 4K camera to create a breathtaking visual journey linking the Ise forest with other forests throughout Japan.","popularity":0.3008,"poster_path":"/vnmVjaBopJeyJHoqamSuC9d8BvU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2014-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"For a thousand years, Japanese have lived in this forest.
