Hundreds of small houses with black and yellow woodwork, in streets named after flowers. This garden city was a first attempt to solve the problem of workers' housing after the First World War. A cooperative system ruined any hope of speculation since the land capital had to remain the property of the community.  The director, who lived in Floréal until he was 18, filmed his \"encounter\" with this neighbourhood. A double portrait of its inhabitants and its architecture, sometimes reduced to abstract motifs, punctuated by the minimalist music composed by him.","popularity":0.1194,"poster_path":"/xLbAwavof6cZXWSeImEstkTKW2E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Floréal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry De Mey","original_name":"Thierry De Mey","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/bij8272GidwzCwASD2KIzrxEHNW.jpg","credit_id":"5d85091a006eee001733e2a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0271508","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.758,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xLbAwavof6cZXWSeImEstkTKW2E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":758}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":257834,"name":"humans"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
