Two worlds: the world of civilization and the world of nature exist simultaneously, next to one planet, but it seems that the distance between them is like from Earth to the moon. The film uses drawings and diaries of Nikolai Miklouho-Maclay, whom the Papuans called the \"Man from the Moon\" and revered as a deity.","popularity":0.1451,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16858,"logo_path":"/z95wNMtKgSoY4DD13mAiZXrN49T.png","name":"Shar
