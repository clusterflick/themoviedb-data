Made with photographer Charles Pratt, the film is a cinematic poem to the people who work on the water. Pratt, who largely financed the film, made it possible for Leo to use his vision as an artist and filmmaker while the blacklist still over-shadowed his life and ability to work in other areas. Here At The Water’s Edge, a film without narration, draws our attention to the often-neglected life in, on and around water – as well as bringing into view what workers on the water give us. Leo, in his own work, was always concerned with seeing what is happening in spaces in the world where others fail to look.","popularity":0.1055,"poster_path":"/cnsweIV4fNp5PVIH23XxvU55y1V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1961-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Here at the Water's Edge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Hurwitz","original_name":"Leo Hurwitz","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/mk3yshXb2ZMUSeV6DLc0BhuA29.jpg","credit_id":"5d82f7b3e04aca0257c2701d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2414256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Pratt","original_name":"Charles Pratt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d82f7a59e45860226949cec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2414257,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Henry Cowell","original_name":"Henry Cowell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d82f7db162bc30227dd8413","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8354688","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cnsweIV4fNp5PVIH23XxvU55y1V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
