It’s 1983, and the fact that he’s a zombie makes him an outcast. Hiding out in the forest, Gloomy has  his sights on a human girl. But her uncle happens to be one of the most feared zombie-hunters in the land. Set in a surreal universe that owes a debt to the visual stylings of Tim Burton, this awardwinning VR experience pairs surreal animation with a darkly humorous take on zombie-human relations.","popularity":0.5216,"poster_path":"/uferS66fLIxJWiuO1Epmei7QOVT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":69170,"logo_path":"/bjmOEX6zgWysR6DiHHcNndRpVsP.png","name":"3dar","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":107266,"logo_path":"/toZMwk4TVbQPCeboN7SUV2qX3dO.png","name":"Atlas
