She had just been released from prison the year before after serving ten years for causing an explosion at an hotel near Belfast. The killing of the three provoked an international outcry and eventual enquiry. Due to her youth, her gender and her stature within the IRA, Mairéad Farrell was, unsurprisingly, quickly subsumed into the pantheon of Irish republican martyrs. But behind the mythologizing and demonisation of the time, there was also a real person, a flesh and blood young woman who was prepared to kill and die for her beliefs.","popularity":0.5443,"poster_path":"/9bXV1yXouKZzuYrAxbUBEpX65Ke.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123212,"logo_path":null,"name":"Loopline
