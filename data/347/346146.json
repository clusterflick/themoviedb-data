Albert Uy is on the verge of an amazing discovery in the Solomon Islands, but there's a threat looming on the horizon. The islands' resources are being exploited, putting all local wildlife at risk. It's a race against time to gather the evidence necessary to prove the existence of a new species before it's lost forever.","popularity":0.6624,"poster_path":"/2yhEvCHBX5BwGNvrrdc7vsb9gF1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Day's Edge Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SB","name":"Solomon Islands"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Islands of Creation","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1481269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"‌J.
