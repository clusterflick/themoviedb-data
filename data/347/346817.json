Brandley worked at Conroe High School, where Ferguson was visiting as a member of the Belleville High School volleyball team. Three days after her body was discovered, Brandley was arrested as the murderer. Jew Don Boney, a popular activist and Houston city council member, leads the fight to uncover the truth about the Ferguson murder. Mike DeGeurin, a Texas attorney, is brought in to act as the head defense attorney for Brandley, and is joined by a former minister, Jim McCloskey. The lawyers discover that not only is there a complete lack of evidence against Brandley, but the District Attorney, James Keeshan, has been strategizing with the presiding judge. After nine years in prison, three trials and a stay of execution that saved Brandley's life, justice finally prevails as Brandley is granted his freedom.","popularity":1.717,"poster_path":"/9UkUPvRnEDwvd21CUauS7zDEr2i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9223,"logo_path":"/40qzTBM38vokoWhLKurficZ5syV.png","name":"Paramount Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4343,"logo_path":"/rXq1B1Hnkdnw6soz1zoGcslK3wb.png","name":"Showtime Networks","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whitewash: The Clarence Brandley Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Courtney B.
