Based on the model of a natural woodland, a forest garden incorporates a wide variety of useful plants, including fruit and nut trees, perennial herbs, and vegetables. Robert Hart blends history, philosophy, anthropology, and seasonal gardening wisdom, which together comprise a remarkable testament to the pleasures of \"hands-off\" as well as hands-on gardening.  Practical features include:  Design guidelines for creating your own perennial food-producing garden\r Lists of recommended plants and varieties,\r An explanation of how plants in different levels or \"stories\" --from ground covers to full-sized trees--coexist and interact in a healthy and productive landscape.","popularity":0.6591,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":65254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iota Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1996-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forest Gardening with Robert Hart","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Guerra","original_name":"Julia Guerra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Themself","credit_id":"561a295ec3a368544d00005a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Fern","original_name":"Ken Fern","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Themself","credit_id":"561a2969c3a36837ca0001ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Guerra","original_name":"Mike Guerra","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Themself","credit_id":"561a297ac3a3685bfe000778","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Hart","original_name":"Robert Hart","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Themself","credit_id":"561a29e5c3a368544d000071","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521398,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Malcolm Baldwin","original_name":"Malcolm Baldwin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561a28d7c3a3685101000671","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521398,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Malcolm Baldwin","original_name":"Malcolm Baldwin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561a2928c3a3686c41001865","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521398,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Malcolm Baldwin","original_name":"Malcolm Baldwin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561a2915c3a36842620015c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1726851","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":458,"name":"hippie"},{"id":6016,"name":"biology"},{"id":5774,"name":"forest"},{"id":11660,"name":"hippie lifestyle"},{"id":18257,"name":"educational"},{"id":159161,"name":"vegetable garden"},{"id":196316,"name":"permaculture"},{"id":200080,"name":"instructional"},{"id":208625,"name":"eco-warrior"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
