Playing the outspoken new cook at a rundown dude ranch, Marjorie forces everyone around her to pitch in and bring some life back into the place. She also sets her sights on old layabout Chill Wills, scheming to rope the critter into marriage. Veteran comedy director Charles W. Lamont moves the proceedings along with style, never missing an opportunity for a low-comedy slapstick turn. The most surprising aspect of Ricochet Romance is that it is not an entry in Marjorie Main's Ma and Pa Kettle series.","popularity":1.2705,"poster_path":"/yn6eCkDm50vV1OLq34tQZq7YJ9W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10330,"logo_path":"/vevakirICdmHxRPeZUdbjFqcFLM.png","name":"Universal International
