Every Sunday afternoon, two atheists debate callers for one hour, on camera. \"Mission Control Texas\" portrays the show, its protagonists, and the discussions between the hosts and callers. The debates between believers and skeptics are funny, touching, and shocking in turn, and they're interspersed with footage of the very public religious displays common in the state of Texas. The film is an intimate, concentrated, and entertaining insight into the culture wars, and is sure to provoke inspiration as well as frustration, no matter which side of the divide you fall on.","popularity":0.7285,"poster_path":"/jmVb1TicwgiJfg4DLuNdDrGTGHU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171177,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alive Vertrieb und Marketing","origin_country":""},{"id":6685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Movement","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Inspiration & Frustration","title":"Atheist America","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mission Control Texas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1822502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Dillahunty","original_name":"Matt Dillahunty","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zVKg2BUXIMRAMJOsx9rx9eiUAYA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67f7b762de5e4dec62ad2f21","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5361862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Glasser","original_name":"Russell Glasser","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/h5g0AgwWA1CjnxQjBpA5iYzc2cm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67f7bc05d4c444a1cc99726e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1482525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralf Buecheler","original_name":"Ralf Bücheler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622693cb11386c001de77e98","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":587432,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrew Mottl","original_name":"Andrew Mottl","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622694405c3247001ba87da4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":887612,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ingo Fliess","original_name":"Ingo Fliess","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622693f087ae7b00716e1781","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3457004,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stefan Linn","original_name":"Stefan Linn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62269402c3926600723be0d3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1482525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralf Buecheler","original_name":"Ralf Bücheler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55903605c3a3685cf9002d74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4137928","wikidata_id":"Q88402662","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mkvsNIjhPpK1f29mS9UtjN7S4ZQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1014,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/g3cVEtYwfMVrPwpMnVXsLm3mBqI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":676},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jmVb1TicwgiJfg4DLuNdDrGTGHU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1598,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eLZBT9zQyKhDn1qUDRILGPLoCuN.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":3,"width":1065},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3xO6QPmW6uUOLMO4wdXvD3LP1z7.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/djn3tSHKxzoT04l6vC4qz2iUrKf.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1014,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/1CA7SKYiPvwR4NE8SIMnxgQfj5H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1556,"name":"texas"},{"id":9817,"name":"behind the scenes"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":11141,"name":"debate"},{"id":161203,"name":"atheism"},{"id":164823,"name":"bible belt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MISSION CONTROL TEXAS - Trailer","key":"lYv0uR1sD6A","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-03-09T09:35:58.000Z","id":"622691349824c800469ba061"}]}}}
