Ex-Rangers Jimmy Wakely and \"Cannonball\" Taylor foil an arrest by state-police officers Hamon and Kelly. Commissioner Jed Brant tells his nephew that his old friend Jimmy is plotting against the law-and-order forces. Vic's fianc√©e and ranch-owner, Sheila Carol, refuses to sign up with the crooked police outfit, and believes Jimmy is an outlaw. On Chief Barton's order, Hamon shoots ex-Rangers Murphy and Payson, so they can be blamed for a raid on Sheila's ranch.","popularity":0.6824,"poster_path":"/emMYxOEHhVsjA6KwhPvTShLulPJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"JIMMY BATTLES PRIVATE OUTLAW ARMY!","title":"The Rangers Ride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1108912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Wakely","original_name":"Jimmy Wakely","popularity":0.1642,"profile_path":"/vMbQJUsSpQj6vUWyz78np5tYkmk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jimmy Wakely","credit_id":"5592fb26c3a368775d002385","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dub Taylor","original_name":"Dub Taylor","popularity":0.5884,"profile_path":"/a7eVCCqOeWPqJpBXoKse1vZj2sc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cannonball Taylor","credit_id":"5592fb2dc3a368775d002387","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Belmont","original_name":"Virginia Belmont","popularity":0.1214,"profile_path":"/4wqEvKMk2NWm3MTZdAfgTDFVABa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sheila Carroll","credit_id":"5592fb37c3a368775a002329","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riley Hill","original_name":"Riley Hill","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":"/y71rcAdXTbJKpd86n32wlhcsF8Q.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Vic Sanders","credit_id":"62f14508109cd0007de11615","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Reed","original_name":"Marshall Reed","popularity":0.2182,"profile_path":"/kMniZFRQRqC1znX5sH9SdjUr2Yy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Police Captain Barton","credit_id":"62f1451adf857c0082469700","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Clark","original_name":"Steve Clark","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/a0lfrbHO67CKwj7JGk0zYw23nqV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jed Brant","credit_id":"62f1452c880c9200828ee75e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierce Lyden","original_name":"Pierce Lyden","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/vmWNPkFmkMUJIQLaVaoQhpuG1bP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sergeant Hamon","credit_id":"62f1453da1074b007beaff00","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Diehl","original_name":"Jim Diehl","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Payson","credit_id":"62f1454f85b1050085246d27","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milburn Morante","original_name":"Milburn Morante","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":"/ycgWDSANRrPr41nfYDhUbaXdmgc.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bullard -
