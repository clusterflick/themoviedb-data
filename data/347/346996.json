After a team of scientists reanimate his corpse, they eventually succeed in destroying the monster they've created. But fifty years later, at the height of the Cold War, the monster is brought back to life once again, this time his brain replaced with a CPU, and his memories substituted with the history of the 20th century. But the power of memory proves too powerful for the madmen who would attempt to play God, as the man-turned-machine attempts to destroy his makers once more.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frankenstein Revisited","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1483430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georg Koszulinski","original_name":"Georg Koszulinski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5593640f925141674c0007dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
