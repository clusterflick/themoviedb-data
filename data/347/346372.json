In those times each province of the Kazakh nation had its own Khan and each tried to supersede the other. The love story of Tolegen, the brave warrior, and the beauty Zhibek ends tragically because of inter-family strife. Tolegen is foully murdered by Bekejan (the batyr, or nobleman, of the rival family), who earlier strived for the hand of Zhibek. Zhibek commits suicide after learning about the death of Tolegen.","popularity":0.537,"poster_path":"/oDkil9tZopEEeqCq8MUxccF7O0r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":232195,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kazakhfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1972-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lady Zhibek","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1329275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asanali Ashimov","original_name":"Асанали Ашимов","popularity":0.4694,"profile_path":"/brNXfOLoEAhMKgcPvbN527701ej.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bekezhan","credit_id":"5784f64592514104bb001284","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1614572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anuarbek Moldabekov","original_name":"Әнуар Молдабеков","popularity":0.103,"profile_path":"/ml1TuRsmXDP7M4PbPvKmniSiMTZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Shege","credit_id":"5784f64f92514104bb001288","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1649163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kuman Tastanbekov","original_name":"Куман Тастанбеков","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tulegen","credit_id":"5784f659c3a3684ef700454b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1649164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meruert Utekesheva","original_name":"Меруерт Өтекешева","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/eRG7P3lP1q0jxhgsxQ35hIfrfW5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Zhibek","credit_id":"5784f663c3a3684f9400445d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1813872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenenbai Kozhabekov","original_name":"Кененбай Кожабеков","popularity":0.2209,"profile_path":"/2GmMgpfAlODnrITnDKsVcaob2ua.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Syrlyday","credit_id":"60ebe1a55e12000074154308","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3154732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gulfairus Ismailova","original_name":"Gulfairus Ismailova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Aygoz","credit_id":"60ebe1b4f9a3fb00291f5ed8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farida Sharipova","original_name":"Farida Sharipova","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":"/6sWkrlnkzLfieK43SBgFTNJVOYc.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Kerdez","credit_id":"60ebe1c4140bad0046f39440","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Idris Nogajbayev","original_name":"Idris Nogajbayev","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lzioM1PGXG8SeAKK7D8eI1ZRvoH.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Karshiga","credit_id":"60ebe1d3a14e10005e9e69fa","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2110020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kauken Kenzhetayev","original_name":"Каукен Кенжетаев","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":"/5OLVGD4Z8XyjoqzaLtegLhAGga9.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Bazarday","credit_id":"60ebe1e6140bad0046f3944a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabira Maikanova","original_name":"Sabira Maikanova","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Kamka","credit_id":"60ebe1f69824c80021e2d51c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3154733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"K.
