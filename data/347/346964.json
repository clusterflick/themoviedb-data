Whatever they saw, also bled into their screens on their mobile devices. We go back 24 hours to follow two of the characters from this group. Lola and Carrie go on a road trip to attend this Halloween screening event. It's being held at an old disused drive-in movie theater. They also research the past reports about the drive-in. It's haunted! People died in front of the screen in the 70s. This event is the 40th anniversary of the deaths. Despite this fact, nothing will stop Lola and Carrie from attending. They want to see what is on the screen.","popularity":0.1499,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Screen","video":false,"vote_average":2.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1353936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Alonso","original_name":"Nicole Alonso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lola","credit_id":"5593398d9251410e92001adc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Andrews","original_name":"Leslie Andrews","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Carrie","credit_id":"559339adc3a3686bad000344","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolyn Crow","original_name":"Carolyn Crow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Beth","credit_id":"559339bc92514152db002a9e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Hilsabeck","original_name":"Natalie Hilsabeck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"559339ccc3a368775d0028a1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1483402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Fancher","original_name":"Nicole Fancher","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/qWUJxUo2i7c6873H2ItaFSYhIGY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Katie","credit_id":"559339e292514152de002bf9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1667555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Michael","original_name":"Aaron Michael","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Party Guy 2","credit_id":"57b5bbdec3a3687e5f000b95","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Paul Baker","original_name":"David Paul Baker","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559339239251410e92001ace","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Paul Baker","original_name":"David Paul Baker","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5593396b9251410e92001ad6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":556810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Burchette","original_name":"Chris Burchette","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55933a559251410e92001af0","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2223822","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
