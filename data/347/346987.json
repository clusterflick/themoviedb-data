[...] Brown...seems to take the event seriously. He wonders what the craft was doing in Roswell of all places, speculating that it was piloted by a 'star boy...joyriding through the cosmos' who 'got lost and lost control.' But Brown also sees his subject playfully, as if through a child's eyes, [...] The fish-eye lens used for some landscape shots curves the horizon line, making the sky seem enclosed-- navigable, traversable. In the film's strongest image, Brown stands facing the camera with a sheaf of papers in hand, as an animated drawing of a spaceship scoots across the paper, suggesting a connection between UFO fantasies and the magical possibilities of cinema.\" -Fred Camper, Chicago Reader","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/7dOlJyI9raWQGb9gf3a1IAB6OWj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roswell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Brown","original_name":"Bill Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"60bbc628c8f858002a9ec21b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Brown","original_name":"Bill Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"560dc8f0c3a368681400b263","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0807958","wikidata_id":"Q61050006","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7dOlJyI9raWQGb9gf3a1IAB6OWj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
