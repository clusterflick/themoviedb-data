Bella wrestles with intersections of traditional life and the new role of girls in modern day Malawi, artfully juggling her various roles of daughter, sister, student, advocate and a girl who just wants to grow up. The film displays a plethora of dramatics and emotional charges expected of adolescents. The film is about true friendships, unrequited romances, school bullying, the desire to be modern, teacher-student relationships and how these impact both the students and the teachers, peer pressure, the impact of stigma and discrimination that comes with HIV/AIDS, the plight of child headed families, and how strong-mindedness and the desire to do right will always prevail.","popularity":0.0314,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"B'ella","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1480979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tawonga Taddja Nkhonjera","original_name":"Tawonga Taddja Nkhonjera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"558a8cbec3a368053e005a0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3644796","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
