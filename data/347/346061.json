Interviews with Van Straaten - outside, at home and at work - smoothly merge with dramatised excerpts from Agnes (played by people like Renée Fokker, Pierre Bokma and Hans Kesting). 'That's me, dressed up as a woman', he says about this creation. The camera peeks over his shoulder when Van Straaten makes his black-and-white drawings with pen and ink. His humour is harsh; he draws people in all their spinelessness, sadness and dishonesty, with a remarkable eye to facial expressions and postures. Through his drawings and stories, he also talks about his personal experiences with alcohol, relationships, family, health and sex - and his lifelong love for birds in the open field.","popularity":0.1246,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Happy Hand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Bokma","original_name":"Pierre Bokma","popularity":0.2325,"profile_path":"/6s4lpbszhXQYBgvbkVBbO1HmwhF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"558a7d599251410f400007bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingeborg Elzevier","original_name":"Ingeborg Elzevier","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":"/e4wltD0ADgA7uQWd5eaSesFW0vy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"558a7d629251414826001c7c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Fokker","original_name":"Renée Fokker","popularity":0.1944,"profile_path":"/lsMVsn4OsKZWVILN6vjTm0v0dD1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"558a7d6b9251415fb6000491","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Kesting","original_name":"Hans Kesting","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":"/u9EB0MIx1FLIbePNWYvWzpt0HMt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"558a7d76925141326a000125","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michiel Romeyn","original_name":"Michiel Romeyn","popularity":0.1885,"profile_path":"/bWJFbmAMVsa48scMu64Rsy2diSk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"558a7d879251411472000dfa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reinout Scholten van Aschat","original_name":"Reinout Scholten van Aschat","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/mnCuo51aVjc7OOgD4P1sB9cMWDL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"558a7d909251410f400007c7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pieter Verhoeff","original_name":"Pieter Verhoeff","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/qRWWNE7fKZveKKPOMwvZDQSIZ3i.jpg","credit_id":"558a7d52925141326a000123","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pieter Verhoeff","original_name":"Pieter Verhoeff","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/qRWWNE7fKZveKKPOMwvZDQSIZ3i.jpg","credit_id":"558a7d349251411472000df2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1480959,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter van Straaten","original_name":"Peter van Straaten","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"558a7d4ac3a3680dfb0024bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0430134","wikidata_id":"Q25616459","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
