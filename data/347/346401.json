Throughout their career Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo have always resisted compromise and the established codes of show business. They have remained determined to maintain control of every link in the chain of their creative process. In the era of globalisation and social networks, they rarely speak in public and neither do they show their faces on TV.  This documentary explores this unprecedented cultural revolution revealing a duo of artists on a permanent quest for creativity, independence and freedom.","popularity":2.0459,"poster_path":"/cZhguyhaCAcRCSEn1QUHPCDSKzk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56580,"logo_path":"/vdE4t1X1oCRfE36kjOvIvR4mWA9.png","name":"BBC Worldwide
