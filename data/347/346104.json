From the bejewel led Easter eggs of the Romanov Tsarinas to the 1970s allure of 'Brut by Faberge' aftershave, and from the Russian revolution to today's high-fashion glitz in New York and London, the film explores a multi-faceted world that began with one man: the prodigiously talented Peter Carl Faberge, Court Jeweler of St Petersburg. Shot at locations across Russia, Europe and USA (including the collection of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II), the film features interview contributions from the world's foremost Faberge authorities, as well as personal reminiscences from Faberge family members.","popularity":0.5266,"poster_path":"/ghItLn35ooEkRvvtNFANiqjuBc4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70000,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Alliance","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faberge: A Life of Its Own","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Faberg√©: A Life of Its Own","type":"alternative spelling"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel West","original_name":"Samuel West","popularity":1.0188,"profile_path":"/bn1nd5zERi5wyHcA1YMGvrHAD5L.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"58dfb218c3a3683cff00980f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1112497,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ian Salvage","original_name":"Ian Salvage","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dfb1b69251415e44009ea8","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1531102,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucy Bright","original_name":"Lucy Bright","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dfb15d9251415e48009a1a","department":"Sound","job":"Music Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1443029,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Foulgham","original_name":"George Foulgham","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dfb1e7c3a3683d35009ad6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583562,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Knight","original_name":"Steve Knight","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dfb180c3a3683d3e009f30","department":"Editing","job":"Digital Intermediate"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1787796,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lisa-Marie McStay","original_name":"Lisa-Marie McStay","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dfb1d29251415e3c009bb1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1787795,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shawn Tracey","original_name":"Shawn Tracey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dfb1389251415e5f009aa1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1787794,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Mark","original_name":"Patrick Mark","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dfb0dac3a3683d46009040","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1787794,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Mark","original_name":"Patrick Mark","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dfb1019251415e44009e4c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1787794,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Mark","original_name":"Patrick Mark","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dfb0cc9251415e360097a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1787794,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Mark","original_name":"Patrick Mark","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dfb0eec3a3683d46009051","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32259,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guy Farley","original_name":"Guy Farley","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/oQkAvuCZPvGSBUvIFIAQXhdMg6j.jpg","credit_id":"5a78e19e925141775c017ce6","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3219610","wikidata_id":"Q20154723","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ghItLn35ooEkRvvtNFANiqjuBc4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lsYmaPQo1QzIfzWVi2gqyCEF8DY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"AA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
