Throughout the 2,000-mile journey, Texas-based filmmaker Bill Brown considers the border as an historical and political geography of aspiration, insecurity, and transition. He talks to undocumented immigrants who have risked their lives to cross the border and to border activists whose politics have put them at odds with the guardians of homeland security. -Film Society of Lincoln Center","popularity":0.0416,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Side","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bill Brown's The Other Side","type":"Distribution Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Brown","original_name":"Bill Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"560dc905c3a368681000abac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1395220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
