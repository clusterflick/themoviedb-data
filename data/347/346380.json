It critically shows a man grappling with today's life villainies and the American society; a man possessed by the stories he tells to the point of being known as \"the inventor of Trance Blues\". Deep roots and History run through his style, in turns dark and majestic, that hasn't forgotten either its West African origins or the Folk and Rock extras. Of History, the singer knows that it's not single sided but made of different phases, down to its Native American origin. The name of his last record is \"My World is Gone\": probably as a way to say that another one will be born, just like each time the Bluesman sings.","popularity":0.0875,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":84960,"logo_path":"/joFd01wqB8oMP65VU0LUlmrpbSW.png","name":"Oléo Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Otis Taylor: Live at Festival Sons d'Hiver 2015","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3268886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otis Taylor","original_name":"Otis Taylor","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/4qYG3SHyR54n8xZb6Tmm1w838DQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"vocals, guitar","credit_id":"61661e2e50733c008bdcbc94","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2016211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Petit","original_name":"Samuel Petit","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61662001b76cbb00913be390","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"mezzo","release_date":"2015-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
