'mean time 2016' sets into motion a series of voracious feedback spirals, using recurrent neural networks to rework original text, and remapping the visual world in infrared and ultraviolet. Comissioned by CIRCUIT and curated by George Clark, the project invited each artist to make a single channel work up to ten minutes in length in response to the writings of the late New Zealand conceptual artist Julian Dashper.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"mean time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5695535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juliet Carpenter","original_name":"Juliet Carpenter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cb3acd19c486d43213f9b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5695536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregory Kan","original_name":"Gregory Kan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cb3ae141d974f7a913fa25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
