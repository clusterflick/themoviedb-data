The residency was a space for experimentation that transformed gallery into sounding board. Participants considered the many implications of ‘feedback’; from exploring the space between a signal and the input, feedback as dialogue, circular systems and gift economies and a self-referential relationship to difference and the need for proximity. What transpired was two months of gathering, listening, composing and collective sounding in a hyperlocal urban environment.  The poem was born from from a dinner discussion about the impact of aural environments in the inner city. How does the city hold sound and how does the body listen? The poet was inspired to perform his piece in an ode to Fluxus; written on index cards and picked at random because homeless individuals have very little control over how sound \"happens\" to them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/Agegfkx0cEztzEMtNLfI8VxnX34.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homeless Sound Poem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5696862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Witwicki","original_name":"James Witwicki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cc37d2acf742b5354db905","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5696863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jenny Hawkinson","original_name":"Jenny Hawkinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cc37e9cde4cdfd2f073a5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Agegfkx0cEztzEMtNLfI8VxnX34.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
