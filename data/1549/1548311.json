These are the artists, poets, photographers, and film-makers who, from the Twenties to the present day, have used film to explore and reveal their vision of this city. Avoiding conventional storytelling or documentary, they have framed New York in more personal, often idiosyncratic ways. It is the New York of everyday experience, with its peoples and neighbourhoods observed from different perspectives.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New York Framed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229247,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Keith Griffiths","original_name":"Keith Griffiths","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/o8L1E5SnGVsSVuwIv5m5WotVUQL.jpg","credit_id":"68cbe717d54886231c4db793","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
