The story centres around Ferdi, a famous singer, who is married to Nuran. Their marriage is unhappy, largely because of Nuran’s flamboyant, showy lifestyle — she seems to crave the public appearances, extravagance and social status that comes with being married to a celebrity. Ferdi, despite his fame, feels stifled by this and isn’t able to find peace or happiness within the marriage.  In the midst of his marital problems, Ferdi meets Şerife, another woman with whom he falls in love. He decides he wants to leave Nuran and divorce her in order to be with Şerife. However, his plans are far from straightforward; Nuran refuses to accept a divorce and this creates tension and conflict.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Haram Oldu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13270682","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
