In an age where only the strongest survive, he’d rather perform his “Tik-Rocks” dances than hunt or fight. But when he’s falsely accused and exiled after a plot to overthrow his father, Gungo is forced to prove himself in the brutal Caveman Games—an ancient competition where strength and bravery determine who leads. Banished to a dangerous and wild land, Gungo must now train with a group of misfits he once mocked. Together, they’ll face prehistoric perils, uncover the truth behind the conspiracy, and learn that real strength comes not from muscles, but from unity, acceptance, and the courage to lead with heart.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/mb99pqgHs7N2Nn4F8Z5OhWDywWD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112266,"logo_path":null,"name":"3 Doubles Producciones","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":58366,"logo_path":"/iu0HfKm2Xh3fnTB0OK3ygoUE4VY.png","name":"Huevocartoon Producciones","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Life Is Great At The Top!
