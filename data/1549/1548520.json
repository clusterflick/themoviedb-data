Uexküll theorized that animals, ourselves included of course, experience unique, species-specific sensory worlds. He called this unique sensory world an animal’s umwelt. Every species is limited in its capacity to sense the larger world outside of its umwelt and is given only a slice of reality. The idea is in some ways obvious, but it had a great impact on scientific and philosophical thought, eventually contributing to the development of cybernetics and later, artificial intelligence.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bzTX6nLFjOk1LFzjYck5pwwEyZA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"OTOLITH","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3203419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ty Tekatch","original_name":"Ty Tekatch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cc36eded60cb4074073acd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bzTX6nLFjOk1LFzjYck5pwwEyZA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
