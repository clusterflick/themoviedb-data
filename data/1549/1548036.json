Drought, extreme weather, rising costs, development pressures, and labor challenges are pushing farmers to their limits. Meanwhile, climate change—the very force behind many of these struggles—is driving a surge in demand for clean energy, transforming farmland into solar fields. Save the Farm, Save the Future follows Colorado farmers and ranchers—from sheep and cattle ranchers to peach growers and small organic farmers—as they explore agrivoltaics, a promising new approach that combines solar power and agriculture on the same land. Can this innovation help save farms while meeting society’s need for renewable energy?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9SjPVvxA8dLMtDkBBP0QVG67h8D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":203312,"logo_path":"/5vaNeDiUjx1CWG394PblLb7stxL.png","name":"Free Range Films (USA)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Farms are disappearing.
