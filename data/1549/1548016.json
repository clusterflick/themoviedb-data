Balshofer’s earlier feature—shot in 1918 as Over the Rhine and released in 1920 as An Adventuress—this version was issued to capitalize on Rudolph Valentino’s sudden stardom. The cut boosts Valentino’s presence through repeated/enlarged shots, looping and out-takes, and reframes the story in a tropical island setting; it’s widely regarded as a cash-in reissue.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/6sINAHc4kzRjReG1c6F7IeLUJyf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":274521,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yorke
