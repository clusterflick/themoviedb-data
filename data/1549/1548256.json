In response to the riots, he created another short film titled 'Go Back To Your Country', a fictional drama against the backdrop of these riots. 'Hated By Default' explores Islah's deep history with racism and Islamophobic behaviour in Britain, and how he uses his creative sword to fight against injustice, even when it seems like a losing battle.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hated by Default","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
