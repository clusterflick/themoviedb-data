Malone constructs a kind of portrait of the cinema that reveals both its former elegance and international Modernity, alongside its current obsolescence and perhaps equally beautiful dilapidation. A narrative is ambiguously laid over the images in the form of a voiceover telling the story of an unusual percussion instrument designed by Russian avant-garde composer Galina Ustvolskaya.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Victory Over the Sun, or, Spaghetti Western Unlike You & Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5695547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Malone","original_name":"Daniel Malone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cb3c882ee8b85a241f256b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
