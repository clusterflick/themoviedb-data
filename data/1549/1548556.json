Based off the novel written by Glen Matlock, one of the founding members of the Sex Pistols who co-wrote ten of twelve iconic songs on their only studio album, NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS. Glen describes in detail the mindset of the UK in the early 70's and divulges a mine of information; Steve's thievery, Wally Nightingale, the search for a singer, the exploding punk scene and a bleak backdrop providing a contrast to the excitement and energy of McLaren's shop. The public will now have a chance to hear the story, not just from a member of the band, but also from a man who had his contributions exceptionally downplayed.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29268559","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
