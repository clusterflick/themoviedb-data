What begins as a lesson in cooking becomes something much deeperâ€”a quiet ritual of connection, memory, and love. As time passes, Mariana finds herself returning to the recipe, now carrying the weight of legacy in her own hands.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/dXjrxr4eclnjHY3KBHdLVFruMf7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Pollo Guisado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5483500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriela Fuentes","original_name":"Gabriela Fuentes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/vFHzP3a9y8YSyQ2oHOkaUgJFq7k.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mariana","credit_id":"68cc3614ed268b2569382955","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5696831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabiola Schirrmeister","original_name":"Fabiola Schirrmeister","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lucia","credit_id":"68cc3622e433123b9ac3fa17","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5523648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teri Underhill","original_name":"Teri Underhill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cc36388c1701c11cc3fa54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5523648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teri Underhill","original_name":"Teri Underhill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cc3647ed60cb4074073ac4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5523648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teri Underhill","original_name":"Teri Underhill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cc3654666a7ee6600a863d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5523648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teri Underhill","original_name":"Teri Underhill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cc365ea05348b8aecf4755","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5696843,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Blaire Alex Angel","original_name":"Blaire Alex Angel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cc368d98f1c6c7584db9a4","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dXjrxr4eclnjHY3KBHdLVFruMf7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":177104,"name":"family values"},{"id":280027,"name":"food culture"},{"id":354911,"name":"grief and remembrance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pollo Guisado (TRAILER)","key":"blqc00uExYU","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-05-13T14:55:02.000Z","id":"68cc35c0d12c055e2dcf477f"}]}}}
