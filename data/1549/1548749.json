Hope finally finds freedom and reunites with the family that never gave up looking for her. Though now safe, she struggles adjusting to her old life as she reconciles with all she’s endured. Hope’s journey is inspired by true stories and powerfully illustrates the courage it takes to find healing after life’s darkest moments.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yjDfgddc0ZynBt4ZKSWNEIkGjB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":231146,"logo_path":"/2xonqaX8pwkpdZsQaKlfWVZzqT2.png","name":"Studio 523","origin_country":"US"},{"id":274670,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pixels of Hope","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2026-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Still Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5417287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luna Rivera","original_name":"Luna Rivera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Hope","credit_id":"68ccd2ceeb7b645d54c3fc1c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2965857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John D.
