Featuring spliced audio of former mayor John Toryâ€™s victory speeches from 2014, 2018, and 2022 municipal election nights, bleak scenes are juxtaposed with a heavy-handed narrative of progress and inclusion. This video performance art is a counternarrative exploration of the surveillance and criminalization of poverty and what cities lose when they leave the most marginalized behind.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mlsLJSqfWsC1yw5eH9T9PKFb2Qp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is a Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5696768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Jones","original_name":"Tamara Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cc31d7d12c055e2dcf4770","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mlsLJSqfWsC1yw5eH9T9PKFb2Qp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
