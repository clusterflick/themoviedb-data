Officially, her invention is intended to treat trauma. Unofficially, she uses it to erase fragments of her own pastâ€”memories she refuses to face.  But when a patient under Miside's care begins reliving memories he never experienced, she discovers that her machine doesn't just erase: it implants. And worse, the memories seem to come from an unknown source... or perhaps from herself.  As the line between reality and memory collapses, Miside must confront a buried truth: what if the memories she's fleeing aren't her own, but those of another version of herself, in a parallel world she herself created?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/8Tr2i5pWAs9bjcpwHrNkSOHl5hR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"A game that becomes reality...","title":"Miside The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5698374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Chui","original_name":"Jan Chui","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mN3SAK69y14WxxPWMkaxaIuLRjU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mita","credit_id":"68cd3d481b656fb1c7073e07","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5698393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sokri Kaba","original_name":"Sokri Kaba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Konoa","credit_id":"68cd40505bae851587c3fcfd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5698396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucie Daval","original_name":"Lucie Daval","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/dd1TiGa4Ct3zAz3X9vLFz4tfECF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hannah","credit_id":"68cd409b0d4d7baa35382d65","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5698400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noah Pierre","original_name":"Noah Pierre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xfBqEGvmim0fb7OabTpdGhgREQe.jpg","credit_id":"68cd41142162475474073d66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Tr2i5pWAs9bjcpwHrNkSOHl5hR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
