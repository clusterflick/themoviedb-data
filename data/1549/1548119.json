Set to the backdrop of an alternate Tonga untouched by western influence and with a wealth of mineral resources (particularly, crystals), you are presented with a subtle yet strikingly different modern world. The ingenuity of their adaptations to, and their cultural flourishes in their diaspora experience is captured in the mundanity of these two leiti’s lives in Aotearoa.” - Sione Monu , Artists Statement.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only Yesterday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5569286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuha’apai Vaeatangitau","original_name":"Manuha’apai Vaeatangitau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"68cb521d367d31db074db5fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5695632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Ah Loo-Matamua","original_name":"Cameron Ah Loo-Matamua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"68cb5a33eb7b645d54c3f6c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5695585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sione Tuívailala Monū","original_name":"Sione Tuívailala Monū","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"68cb8ade30e8cb44820a8399","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5695829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akashi Lee","original_name":"Akashi Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"68cb8aef3565ab0e8dc3f763","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5695585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sione Tuívailala Monū","original_name":"Sione Tuívailala Monū","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cb4951f80c14220e4db603","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5695610,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ralph Brown","original_name":"Ralph Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cb51e72332d1a74338264f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5695585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sione Tuívailala Monū","original_name":"Sione Tuívailala Monū","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cb51f4ea36be0ddc38264d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
