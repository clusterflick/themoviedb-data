This metaphorically relates to the journey of a group of Amis people who left their coastal homes in the 1970s for city work. In Taipei, they established the “Xizhou Tribe” near a riverbank, contributing to urban development but ultimately facing displacement. This dichotomy highlights the choices they made: some stayed in cities, while others returned to ancestral lands. Decades later, as they completed new houses, their story reflects a deeper narrative of indigenous urbanization—a crossroads of starting anew or enduring broken connections with their past and identity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/p5Q3ZRev2Xj59Gtw9cXeHdGm9Bt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2024-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding Home at Tides End","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"itini i lalekal a maro’","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5698202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ateng A'yic","original_name":"潘志偉","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cd276a9f95d334365e9246","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kV0lZdV6S8GeIjheGdHbN8YILKs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/p5Q3ZRev2Xj59Gtw9cXeHdGm9Bt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1448}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taiwan International Democratic Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taiwan International Ethnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2025-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
