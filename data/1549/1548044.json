While the camera spares no detail of bruised flesh, the filmmakers’ gaze remains free of voyeurism or vulgarity: this is not exploitation, but an empathetic act of documentation, attentive to bodies’ dignity and the depth of the human experience.  The result is particularly intense and can prove challenging even disturbing, and is therefore intended only for an adult and informed audience.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/c1kZIMcDXzGJSjiEqH9DM2jBqXA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2025-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gift of Pain","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5696011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanna Bo","original_name":"Sanna Bo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68cbabb22565e37193149008","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5696012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Duncan","original_name":"John Duncan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68cbabc5de7d223df3c3f77a","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5696013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ábel Fazekas","original_name":"Ábel Fazekas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68cbabdf2565e37193149012","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5696014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emcsi","original_name":"Emcsi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68cbabea3aa0dc75a33827d8","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5696015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dániel Láposi","original_name":"Dániel Láposi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68cbabf78404aa5a57c3f7a2","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5696016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anouk Neyens","original_name":"Anouk Neyens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68cbac06dd9a34468f0a83e7","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5696017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice von Sinnen","original_name":"Alice von Sinnen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68cbac11d4138872345e8c9b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5695360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Atanáz Babinchak","original_name":"Atanáz Babinchak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cb1faf8be50456b4de861d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5695363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Babinchak","original_name":"Ivan Babinchak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cb1fc727aa6eb8491f0ae1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36016563","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":989,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c1kZIMcDXzGJSjiEqH9DM2jBqXA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"},{"id":312206,"name":"disturbing"},{"id":325310,"name":"avant garde film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Release year","release_date":"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
