His experiments render him blind. Country lass Meera (Shamim) tends to him and they fall in love. Later Meera meets a sage (Shah) who has an expensive magic potion that cures blindness. Unable to afford it, Meera kills the sage, grabs the medicine and goes to Kanwalâ€™s house while all nature protests her actions. There the evil Diwan (Bhagwandas) and his accomplices steal the medicine, cure Kanwal and take the credit. Kanwal, who can now see but does not recognise Meera, accuses her of murder but eventually realises the truth.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Armaan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0331176","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
