One guy caught the ball, another guy ended up with it. Who is the rightful owner? The lawyers can't agree; the fans can't agree; even the wisened professors of property law can't agree. This is a story documenting the hilarious lengths to which someone will go for a baseball, and the few fans that will put their lives on hold for years, staking everything on one judge's decision.","popularity":0.3076,"poster_path":"/AgGtlPWt6MDfOkjr7y2ybPQBuyk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up for Grabs","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":579396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marty Appel","original_name":"Marty Appel","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4941c3a368484e122351","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Bonds","original_name":"Barry Bonds","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b25RDvAXECJTHXQ4MPLtxWy9Ldx.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4941c3a368484e122355","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":579398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Hayashi","original_name":"Patrick Hayashi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4941c3a368484e122359","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Popov","original_name":"Alex Popov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4941c3a368484e12235d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":579401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Rowlands","original_name":"Ted Rowlands","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Himself -
