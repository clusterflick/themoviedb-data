The wounded pilot seeks help. All the villagers, who speak only of resistance, refuse to help, for fear of reprisals. Only the mayor, Dr. Leproux, takes him in and nurses him back to health, then entrusts him to the Resistance. But the Germans get wind of the story and arrest Leproux. He is saved by Major Frantz. But the budding friendship between these two men \"doesn't stop the drums\", and the war is on.","popularity":0.3548,"poster_path":"/oaawd7kLyDf0ZMAB5PdwPMNAUGD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1961-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women and War","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Blier","original_name":"Bernard Blier","popularity":0.7069,"profile_path":"/6xRHGb7CNDa83rcTzCp3LeIvU2s.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"le docteur Leproux, maire du village","credit_id":"52fe4941c3a368484e122427","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":372310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucile Saint-Simon","original_name":"Lucile Saint-Simon","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/j4aWavjABHOYT1w6apO8sUhLWN7.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Catherine Leproux, la fille du maire","credit_id":"52fe4941c3a368484e12242b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lutz Gabor","original_name":"Lutz Gabor","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"le major allemand","credit_id":"52fe4941c3a368484e12242f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Sorano","original_name":"Daniel Sorano","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/bsZ20ExGzFIcDpYWpQDXnWspHx8.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"le Toulousain, un résistant","credit_id":"52fe4941c3a368484e122433","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":272412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Doat","original_name":"Anne Doat","popularity":0.1761,"profile_path":"/c2ArkvrxmZhNNIqnxfE1xbirmxJ.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Dany, une résistante","credit_id":"52fe4941c3a368484e122437","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":579414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Béatrice Bretty","original_name":"Béatrice Bretty","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/rGPnSpJXlI5ywS2EaVPvvAxNiMg.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Germaine, la bonne du maire","credit_id":"52fe4941c3a368484e12243b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Virlogeux","original_name":"Henri Virlogeux","popularity":0.5,"profile_path":"/cDNnWUqs3CPrHisXtQB82KQEB0n.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"le garde-champêtre","credit_id":"52fe4941c3a368484e12243f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulette Dubost","original_name":"Paulette Dubost","popularity":0.2321,"profile_path":"/zKDMeaAG0qNHpB2BKFdPEA5013R.jpg","cast_id":29,"character":"la veuve","credit_id":"5466998422136e15bb00065d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":579415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Le Couey","original_name":"Catherine Le Couey","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Mme Gaspard, l'épicière","credit_id":"52fe4941c3a368484e122447","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Marin","original_name":"Jacques Marin","popularity":0.2231,"profile_path":"/oWsfdSs4XG2i0ectecYJpj8DJna.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"M.
