Charlie Pontus (Joseph Culp) wanders around Los Angeles torn between his efforts to sell a screenplay and find his next meal. His natural optimism keeps him afloat as he walks the tight-rope between his love for the beautiful, exotic Ylayali (Kathleen Luong) and his desperate connection to The Chief (Robert Culp), the Hollywood producer who has the power to give life or take it away. Stubbornly refusing to relinquish his principles, he sinks deeper and deeper into spiritual crisis, finally confronting God in a Jobian showdown.","popularity":0.8516,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph
