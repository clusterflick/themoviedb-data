But life was so busy with raising kids and pursuing the American dream that he never got around to acting on his concerns. Until nowâ€¦ Bennett journeys from complacency to consciousness in his feature-length documentary, What a Way To Go: Life at the End of Empire. He reviews his Midwestern roots, ruthlessly examines the stories he was raised with, and then details the grim realities humans now face: escalating climate change, resource shortages, degraded ecosystems, an exploding global population and teetering global economies.","popularity":0.0904,"poster_path":"/6Q2Yx3QQHYqChuJ2Ctkp6h8F7OC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A middle-class white guy comes to grips with Peak Oil, Climate Change, Mass Extinction, Population Overshoot and the demise of the American lifestyle.","title":"What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":580571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy S.
