The revelations found in Rossi's diary go far beyond The Colonel's actions in Algeria, and give an insight on how dirty Algeria's War for Independence really was.","popularity":0.6181,"poster_path":"/j7uzNau9xUsoNuYBNEytFsSSotA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1926,"logo_path":"/eSnbNBmDyok9rcpWxYRaBjTaq1n.png","name":"Les Films du Fleuve","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":13837,"logo_path":null,"name":"K.G.
