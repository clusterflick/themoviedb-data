Emma's parents seem more interested in their own interests than in her. One evening when Emma overhears her mother talking about how tragic it must be to have your child kidnapped, Emma decides to stage her own kidnapping. She soon meets Malthe, a kind-hearted, child-like, naïve sewer cleaner who literally stumbles on to her. She convinces Malthe that she is a Russian princess whose family is being chased by Bolsheviks, so Malthe lets Emma stay with him in his very modest abode. After being \"kidnapped\" for a few days, Emma decides to return home. But, just as she is about to return, she overhears a couple of servants talking about how her parents don't seem to be very upset over her dilemma....","popularity":0.9365,"poster_path":"/4PzXNhhVy3IKmxewnPjblCdhx5M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9372,"logo_path":"/yFDmBNoacfgPWutpvD242xsuKmm.png","name":"Metronome Productions","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emma's Shadow","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Eine ungewöhnliche Entführung","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Skuggan av Emma","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"I skuggan av Emma","type":"TV title"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"Skyggen av Emma","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"O Refúgio de Emma","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'Ombre d'Emma","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Line Kruse","original_name":"Line Kruse","popularity":0.2164,"profile_path":"/AqGjJgCMeXYBP18DR6XV0OI3Ydv.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Emma Zülow","credit_id":"52fe4931c3a368484e11f261","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Börje Ahlstedt","original_name":"Börje Ahlstedt","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/vTSfBV4IY1DozY70l3M3oy5K6sH.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Malthe Eliasson","credit_id":"52fe4931c3a368484e11f265","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1045301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inge Sofie Skovbo","original_name":"Inge Sofie Skovbo","popularity":0.0517,"profile_path":"/dWNfPlgqtkBaAipHNSo11Fcuk68.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Emma's Mother","credit_id":"52fe4931c3a368484e11f27d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1045300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bent N.
