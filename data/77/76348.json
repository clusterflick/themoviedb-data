In addition, she has a little blackmail operation going on on the side with politicians who can't afford a scandal. She got started on this business after she was raped, and hasn't looked back since. Now the police are on her trail, and she avails herself of the services of a couple who make a profession of hiding wanted criminals. At the hideout, she meets Simon, a second-generation mobster. As the police close in, Françoise and Simon go on the run together, pulling off occasional heists for operating money. Before long, they have also fallen in love.","popularity":0.3759,"poster_path":"/brtJa4LvmyjjMHe2csyFXf0rKvj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1742,"logo_path":"/kxKBr4UuwuVdMhuunZ579vWd5in.png","name":"Les Films
