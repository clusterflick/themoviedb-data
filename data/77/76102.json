A man with no home and no job, Paul Erdös was the most prolific mathematician who ever lived. Born in Hungary in 1913, Erdös wrote and co-authored over 1,500 papers and pioneered several fields in theoretical mathematics. At the age of 83 he still spent most of his time on the road, going from math meeting to math meeting, continually working on problems. He died on September 20, 1996 while attending such a meeting in Warsaw, Poland.","popularity":0.219,"poster_path":"/mc1goqppZ5QZUeBKyGTsqRwquwG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of a wandering mathematician obsessed with unsolved problems.","title":"N is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erdős","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"N Is a Number","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Erdös","original_name":"Paul Erdös","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58ce98d8c3a36850d702182e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1582025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Paul Csicsery","original_name":"George Paul Csicsery","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce98eb9251415a41023ae7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552444,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Knoop","original_name":"John Knoop","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec893580fb17f001d7db866","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3278,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Adler","original_name":"Mark Adler","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/g31rIHaTBeK0xHHMezl7NwmzYtP.jpg","credit_id":"5ec893630fb17f001d7db87a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0125425","wikidata_id":"Q6956300","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c3AdPfMa8KDyyWSyHlYWOQqViIp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mc1goqppZ5QZUeBKyGTsqRwquwG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/59VXEPTCUmCULRNxYpcJuCwLjvt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2PrI2QrSX4nFh5SsIMySZJuxhOo.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hE3sj2S7mQKnDOyFMlXBa7oJWsd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/30VJeJ6TShwYBU5eNdqvwi6kwPl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6009,"name":"mathematics"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"N is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erdős (Trailer)","key":"_3PdSqeMEM4","published_at":"2011-03-04T19:22:55.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6c7c3a3685448007080"}]}}}
