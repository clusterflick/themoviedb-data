The short contact with family brings Mort back to what are left of his senses and he returns to the last home he remembers in Chicago. His sister Eileen lives in their family home now with her sixteen year old son, Abe. Her older son Moo, the now missing nephew, helped spark Mort's return to his family. Three, four, five weeks pass as Mort waits outside his home and makes a tenuous re-entry into family life. Abe dreams of a sailboat and distant horizons. He saves money and sees an advertisement for the Kathy II. He and his friend calculate a way to buy the vessel from two unscrupulous rogues who make ends meet wholesaling liquor and operating a sometime boatyard.","popularity":1.2269,"poster_path":"/yUyuKgCOlSZJKmXlU7dzJExJ8kd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Left Bank Films","origin_country":""},{"id":38533,"logo_path":null,"name":"Drunkboat Chicago LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drunkboat","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Malkovich","original_name":"John Malkovich","popularity":2.3501,"profile_path":"/8YfVmWi9Z1iyX9Oc90yd9dbhSfL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mort","credit_id":"52fe494fc3a368484e124eab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Goodman","original_name":"John Goodman","popularity":4.1878,"profile_path":"/yyYqoyKHO7hE1zpgEV2XlqYWcNV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Fletcher","credit_id":"52fe494fc3a368484e124eaf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob Zachar","original_name":"Jacob Zachar","popularity":0.2076,"profile_path":"/qi1m6OmuYhhn6evwfhKhPcRJhsX.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Abe","credit_id":"5c5292bfc3a368477799567c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dana Delany","original_name":"Dana Delany","popularity":2.1721,"profile_path":"/eDe2cjgxQV0G111I8iXCrt4w4u6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Eileen","credit_id":"52fe494fc3a368484e124ea7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":159394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Ortlieb","original_name":"Jim Ortlieb","popularity":0.4918,"profile_path":"/ehQGmHYLxnkZrxVklSgof2KfAvD.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Morley","credit_id":"5c5292d2c3a36847939880a4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Deneen","original_name":"Brian Deneen","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"David","credit_id":"5c5292ebc3a36874b9867232","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skipp Sudduth","original_name":"Skipp Sudduth","popularity":0.3014,"profile_path":"/5vVP9t07OsJQcgxwNrDthNUtA1Y.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"","credit_id":"5cc5d4260e0a264eefec36a5","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5271,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lisa Rinzler","original_name":"Lisa Rinzler","popularity":0.1363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6060592a1130bd0029a8001c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385938,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Randy Buescher","original_name":"Randy Buescher","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5468bcb7eaeb816b55000d89","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1697873,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bob Meyer","original_name":"Bob Meyer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580b63a4925141712c001fd7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1697873,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bob Meyer","original_name":"Bob Meyer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580b63bac3a368258f001dcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9202,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steven A.
