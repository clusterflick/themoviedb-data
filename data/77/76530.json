In the 1970s, they left everything behind in order to go to Germany as \"guest workers.\" Although assimilated in their new country, they long for the old one. Now they are able to realize their dream of returning with their German husbands to Dogil Maeul, the German village that has been created for people like them. Situated in a picturesque bay, the village is indeed more German than Germany--there is even whole meal bread and Frankfurter sausages. This is the new-old home to which their sixty something husbands Armin, Willi and Ludwig have come in the hope of spending their remaining years. However, there is still something missing for the three women as they discover it is not so easy to pick up where they left off.","popularity":0.1145,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home from Home","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":579227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Young-Sook Theis","original_name":"Young-Sook Theis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe493fc3a368484e121dc9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":579228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armin Theis","original_name":"Armin Theis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe493fc3a368484e121dcd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":579229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chun-Ja Engelfried","original_name":"Chun-Ja Engelfried","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe493fc3a368484e121dd1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":579230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willi Engelfried","original_name":"Willi Engelfried","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe493fc3a368484e121dd5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":579231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Woo-Za Strauss-Kim","original_name":"Woo-Za Strauss-Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe493fc3a368484e121dd9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludwig Strauss-Kim","original_name":"Ludwig Strauss-Kim","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe493fc3a368484e121ddd","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17506,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Helge Albers","original_name":"Helge Albers","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe493fc3a368484e121db9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sung Hyung Cho","original_name":"Sung Hyung Cho","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe493fc3a368484e121db3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":17504,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roshanak Behesht Nedjad","original_name":"Roshanak Behesht Nedjad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe493fc3a368484e121dbf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sung Hyung Cho","original_name":"Sung Hyung Cho","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe493fc3a368484e121dad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":41302,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ole Nicolaisen","original_name":"Ole Nicolaisen","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe493fc3a368484e121dc5","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1363465","wikidata_id":"Q1340988","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
