Tried and convicted for their arson murders, Willingham was executed in February 2004 despite overwhelming expert criticism of the prosecution's arson evidence. Today, Willingham's name has become a call for reform in the field of forensics and a rallying cry for the anti-death penalty movement; yet he remains an indisputable \"monster\" in the eyes of Texas Governor Rick Perry, who ignored the science that could have saved Willingham's life. Equal parts murder mystery, forensic investigation and political drama, INCENDIARY documents the haunted legacy of a prosecution built on \"folklore.\"","popularity":0.1919,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yokel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes the truth goes up in flames","title":"Incendiary: The Willingham Case","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":274792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Mims","original_name":"Steve Mims","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c41","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549267,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe Bailey Jr.","original_name":"Joe Bailey Jr.","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c4d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":580569,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Korey Pereira","original_name":"Korey Pereira","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c65","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":580570,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Buzz Moran","original_name":"Buzz Moran","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c71","department":"Sound","job":"Music Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549268,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kakii Keenan","original_name":"Kakii Keenan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c5f","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549267,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe Bailey Jr.","original_name":"Joe Bailey Jr.","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c6b","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":580568,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Reid Nelson","original_name":"Reid Nelson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c47","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":274792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Mims","original_name":"Steve Mims","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":274792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Mims","original_name":"Steve Mims","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c53","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549267,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe Bailey Jr.","original_name":"Joe Bailey Jr.","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549267,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe Bailey Jr.","original_name":"Joe Bailey Jr.","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c3b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32234,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Graham Reynolds","original_name":"Graham Reynolds","popularity":0.0821,"profile_path":"/2ZhhONrUKCtQvhVsKNikbTxGaaQ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c77","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":542413,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott Honea","original_name":"Scott Honea","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c7d","department":"Editing","job":"Archival Footage Research"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":274792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Mims","original_name":"Steve Mims","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494ec3a368484e124c59","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1744847","wikidata_id":"Q6014235","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
