Mechano is frighteningly efficient, foiling several attempts by Jerry. Jerry turns this efficiency against him by unleashing several mechanical mice; the zealous robot makes a shambles of the house, and finally itself, in the process of chasing them down. Tom is welcomed back, but at the last moment, a key part of the robot had gone down Tom's throat; Jerry activates it, and sends Tom chasing after one of the wind-up mice.","popularity":1.0882,"poster_path":"/1CsQQC8zcVDpPL0fqgaOFftyMHS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89238,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGM Cartoon Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Push-Button Kitty","video":false,"vote_average":6.688,"vote_count":32,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Tom & Jerry: Fjärrstyrning över styr","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"机器猫","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Randolph","original_name":"Lillian Randolph","popularity":0.2472,"profile_path":"/k3dOsZunpup8wQcj1jKem9Oam8E.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mammy Two-Shoes (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4923c3a368484e11c039","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137562,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott Bradley","original_name":"Scott Bradley","popularity":0.155,"profile_path":"/AjQ95xfBtFc39ADKaPi1jupim2m.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4923c3a368484e11c023","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Hanna","original_name":"William Hanna","popularity":0.7365,"profile_path":"/zf5WRsouQN0ozuJ4vFosXylPjaZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4923c3a368484e11c011","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149098,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kenneth Muse","original_name":"Kenneth Muse","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4923c3a368484e11c035","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137486,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fred Quimby","original_name":"Fred Quimby","popularity":0.2035,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4923c3a368484e11c01d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149100,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Irven Spence","original_name":"Irven Spence","popularity":0.1011,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4923c3a368484e11c029","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13594,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph Barbera","original_name":"Joseph Barbera","popularity":1.2363,"profile_path":"/16UhnbVLaX9QBtcnjLH6hrdzq4F.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4923c3a368484e11c017","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149095,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ed Barge","original_name":"Ed Barge","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4923c3a368484e11c02f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0045059","wikidata_id":"Q7261717","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1582,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yiJFX0ZJU30j0wbzUXNMiQWy6QM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2812}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2484,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1CsQQC8zcVDpPL0fqgaOFftyMHS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1656},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/emOrz5VWYkWzrKfCa6U8rhyIbJv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14544,"name":"robot"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
