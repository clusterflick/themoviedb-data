Their name is the German term for \"dancing mania\", but is directly translated with \"dance-rage\". Tanzwut are known for their heavy use of bagpipes, an unusual instrument for a metal band. The group has achieved international success, filling concert halls as far away from their home country as Mexico. The band's recent releases have been gravitating towards a more industrial metal approach, incorporating the use of more down-tuned guitars, harsher vocals and darker atmospheres. Tanzwut's live performances have a medieval theme, expressed through their stages, costumes and choreography.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rGXsO2K8H9l9QBxQwmj2WELBRdq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Muffathalle in München München am 8.
