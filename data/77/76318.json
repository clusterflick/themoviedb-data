The war shaped American, Canadian and British destiny in the most literal way possible: had one or two battles or decisions gone a different way, a map of the United States today would look entirely (and shockingly) different. The fires of this war forged the nation of Canada; at the same time, the result tolled the end of Native American dreams of a separate nation. By war's end, the process of Native nation removal had already begun in the southeast, paving the way for a Cotton Kingdom powered by slavery, and a United States that had been on the verge of collapse was ready to announce its arrival as a global power. The U.S. did not win the War of 1812, but the noble experiment of democracy had managed to survive intense pressure from without, and within.","popularity":0.9024,"poster_path":"/qxe7tVD0OQUICxuAu3qP90I5x5p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10722,"logo_path":"/mPJs7G32jMVmgUlcuobZelsjkhv.png","name":"Florentine Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":87941,"logo_path":null,"name":"WNED-TV Channel 17","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A small but bitter war - that forged the destiny of a continent.","title":"The War of 1812","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Mantegna","original_name":"Joe Mantegna","popularity":1.5399,"profile_path":"/4jzvAE6B1eoiZDUnDUuMazirCPP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64d1e12e549dda00e2dea1dd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1106084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Hott","original_name":"Lawrence Hott","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d1e1bf945d3600e26727d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1961256,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ken Chowder","original_name":"Ken Chowder","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d1e20b4d679100acf1f800","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1106085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diane Garey","original_name":"Diane Garey","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d1e17ac3bffe0f0544afed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2125231,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Judy Hyman","original_name":"Judy Hyman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d1e2486d4c9700ec58fbc9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525379,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stephen McCarthy","original_name":"Stephen McCarthy","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d1e2ae549dda00c5408334","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315302,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rikk Desgres","original_name":"Rikk Desgres","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d1e353945d3600aca079fb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826280,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Pequignot","original_name":"Steve Pequignot","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d1e39d4d679100ff692a45","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826280,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Pequignot","original_name":"Steve Pequignot","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d1e3e16d4c9700cb7f3220","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826281,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stephanie Erstad","original_name":"Stephanie Erstad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d1e4454d67910139ef9472","department":"Crew","job":"Transcriptions"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2086938","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/knFHvmH6fSa2XVHhLEbOzIHiFVC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qxe7tVD0OQUICxuAu3qP90I5x5p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1279}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
