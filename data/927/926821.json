Black and white rectangles, embedded one within another against a black background, are generated through a closed-circuit system: a camera’s signal is inverted and displayed on a monitor that the same camera is framing. The camera, as it were, sees itself seeing itself seeing itself and so on. (It’s the inversion itself that produces the alternating black and white rectangles). The number of rectangles is based on a precise score involving seven channels of chanted text (all in the voice of the artist)—a kind of “language canon.”","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":"/xPfaZuJzPWDrYfRDU6ZfQwGxcX7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black/White/Text","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Black White Text","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Hill","original_name":"Gary Hill","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e0fb0112425c00448f5578","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xPfaZuJzPWDrYfRDU6ZfQwGxcX7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
