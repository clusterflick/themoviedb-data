The footage consists of two edited concerts filmed on the Borgholm Castle ruin on the Swedish Baltic Sea island of Öland on 25–26 July 1989.  The project had a considerable budget, with the production crew hiring two helicopters from the Swedish Air Force to film aerial shots. Footage from this film was used to create two music videos: \"Listen to Your Heart\" and \"Dangerous\". Included as an unlisted track on all editions of the film is a remix of \"The Look\", which mixes the song with footage from two preexisting music videos directed by Peter Heath: \"The Look\" and \"Dressed for Success\".","popularity":0.2597,"poster_path":"/lnOxCcScgPAIKuaPjg2oNAau6ga.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1989-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roxette: Look Sharp Live 1989","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1246017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Fredriksson","original_name":"Marie Fredriksson","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":"/ydADpxnY7ePlutY2HBxNlD2Wxhc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61e02750bf0f63001ae1aba9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Per Gessle","original_name":"Per Gessle","popularity":0.1603,"profile_path":"/emNrprvcSe5TNTjnEcPqsed02FI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61e0277abf0f63009a131ed0","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":795,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lnOxCcScgPAIKuaPjg2oNAau6ga.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":33922,"name":"pop music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
