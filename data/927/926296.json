Michel Djerzinski, a genius researcher specialized in molecular biology, mysteriously disappears in Ireland.

former hippie who has always refused to raise her children in a conventional way, and Annabelle, with whom Michel will fall in love as a child.","popularity":0.6431,"poster_path":"/vgZDh2rS3cRzVugNXOuU05bp3LN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113965,"logo_path":"/rPMpDnHQQ7M7BFU37NGAO1haC4s.png","name":"Storia
