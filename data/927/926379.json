The first is Jessica, a recent college graduate trying to become an actress. Her father feels that pursuing acting in the Midwest is not worth it and she should do something else. She persists and finds a play to act in, produced by a bumbling director. She desperately tries to find opportunities but is repeatedly disappointed. The second woman is Kathy, a middle-aged single mother trying to raise her young son. She works as a bartender but looks for a second job in order to pay for rent and sustain a living. She ultimately gets a position at a local theatre. The third woman is Eleanor, a retired senior who is mourning the loss of her husband and lamenting the fact that her daughters don't seem to care about her anymore.","popularity":0.0785,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dolwa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Prettyman","original_name":"Jennifer Prettyman","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kathy/Jessica","credit_id":"61df4937271671006b68e0ba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Mondloh","original_name":"Janet Mondloh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eleanor/Kathy","credit_id":"61df494f42d8a500429ed64c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Suszko","original_name":"Alex Suszko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Aps/Caleb","credit_id":"61df4961cb30840098d50e9b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Suszko","original_name":"Alex Suszko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61df4975676ce2008cb35ead","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Suszko","original_name":"Alex Suszko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61df498607291c009b3cd440","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11416348","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
