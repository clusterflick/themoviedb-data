In the second part, the actions are directed at people, and the anxiety changes because the situations are created deliberately and uncritically.

Images of a man and a woman alternate with images of windows, mirrors, sofas, and the interior.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7BA2R4ppkdkAqS7IWw6TpfdBgdv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"III/71 Aktionen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1824907,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","original_name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/z0HvKg68ujOW6NC0N17gln4eY8h.jpg","credit_id":"61e0dec412425c006c481def","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7BA2R4ppkdkAqS7IWw6TpfdBgdv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
