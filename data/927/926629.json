Duke, of the \"Bar Nothin'\" ranch, rides into town and takes the job. Crooked cattle buyer Bill Harliss, aided by Bess's unscrupulous suitor, Stinson, tries to coerce the Lynnes to sell their herd at a low price. Duke learns of their scheme and forces him to buy the cattle at its full market value. As retribution, Stinson robs Duke and leaves him in the desert to die, but the foreman catches a stray horse and returns to the ranch. Stinson convinces Bess and Harold to return East with him, claiming that Duke has stolen their money and escaped into Mexico. As the train leaves the station, Duke chases and subdues Stinson, winning Bess for himself.","popularity":0.3081,"poster_path":"/wyl6iuZAZZplE6TSOCXEpqjCyaL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A romance in which a wild Ranch is tamed by a Gentle Girl.","title":"Bar Nothing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buck Jones","original_name":"Buck Jones","popularity":0.1482,"profile_path":"/mO2WCdlygUVNr3yg8AiOCvcNHOC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Duke Smith","credit_id":"61e05e89ffd44d004439e782","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1072359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Renick","original_name":"Ruth Renick","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/b8yex3Q0Lg0PbFdaop6XxFc45Sx.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bess Lynne","credit_id":"61e05e988cfcc7001cfd6203","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Edmund Carewe","original_name":"Arthur Edmund Carewe","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":"/oU2gb8ZKlXfdze6JcLJCAQTH5i6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Stinson","credit_id":"61e05ea412425c006c4672bc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Farley","original_name":"Jim Farley","popularity":0.4315,"profile_path":"/155ugk9VWe00T7wWSo3pqb9b80d.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bill Harliss","credit_id":"61e05eb12811a10019b829be","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Buckley","original_name":"William Buckley","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Harold Lynne","credit_id":"61e05ec0a6fdaa0068fb6cbb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Sedgwick","original_name":"Edward Sedgwick","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/oy7NTpU0sODG4HpPi7xQYf60avh.jpg","credit_id":"61e05e5d441b030065ea92c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109608,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Stone","original_name":"John Stone","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e05e68cb5c8e0042a79fd0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109608,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Stone","original_name":"John Stone","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e05e6fcb5c8e00670c9135","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457519,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Clyde Westover","original_name":"Clyde Westover","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e05e7beec4f30042f3453d","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0011943","wikidata_id":"Q110972435","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wyl6iuZAZZplE6TSOCXEpqjCyaL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1921-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
