The film is narrated by Emmy-winning actor Jon Hamm and includes never-before-seen archival footage and in-depth interviews with those who knew and studied Williams, including his daughter Claudia Williams, author/journalist Ben Bradlee, Jr., veteran baseball writer Roger Angell and award-winning broadcasters Bob Costas and the late Dick Enberg. The program demonstrates the power of the heroic myth-making culture in which Williams flourished. Lesser-known topics explored in the film include Williams’ Mexican-American background, his experiences serving during World War II and the Korean War, and his deep rage over his mother’s virtual abandonment of him and his younger brother.","popularity":0.5546,"poster_path":"/eIreMpeHym5xuNT75EvQiAFvCu3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nick Davis Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"The Greatest Hitter Who Ever Lived\"","title":"Ted Williams: \"The Greatest Hitter Who Ever Lived\"","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Hamm","original_name":"Jon Hamm","popularity":3.1045,"profile_path":"/mrXE5fZbEDPc7BEE5G21J6qrwzi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61e03d63eec4f3001ca0d40a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Costas","original_name":"Bob Costas","popularity":0.5564,"profile_path":"/icnJnhC0voFGH9QaIiWQf5MhL5N.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c821bb7a97ab007b62a01c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":197044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wade Boggs","original_name":"Wade Boggs","popularity":0.3094,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c82d41c5c1ef007cc26ad5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3879701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Votto","original_name":"Joey Votto","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c82d4a2f3b1700dbdf8ac4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3879702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Dimaggio","original_name":"Emily Dimaggio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c82d55142ef100dacf945d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3879703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willie McCovey","original_name":"Willie McCovey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c82d7170b44400e95a3d57","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Williams","original_name":"Claudia Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c82d7cc5c1ef00a04972e6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Enberg","original_name":"Dick Enberg","popularity":0.0931,"profile_path":"/mY0vj5HHnmjBZrYDpuzuL63DfOx.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c82d8cc5c1ef00cb1c8925","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Davis","original_name":"Nick Davis","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63caeceee24b930089666aad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7456324","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":1399,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eIreMpeHym5xuNT75EvQiAFvCu3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":953}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":290687,"name":"ted williams"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
