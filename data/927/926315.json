The expedition leader, Craig Smith, a researcher at the University of Hawaii, speculated more than 20 years ago that the corpses of enormous marine mammals would disrupt the balance of the deep water plain, usually deprived of food. His discoveries confirmed his conjectures and led him even further, to explore the mystery of deep water inhabitants... This film presents us with exceptional footage never seen before, filmed two kilometers underwater. We follow a man like no other, founder of a new discipline in modern oceanography: the ecology of whales corpses.","popularity":0.0553,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Expédition dans les abysses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2187804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Dubor","original_name":"Serge Dubor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfb627322b2b0149063c4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":967752,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dominique Barneaud","original_name":"Dominique Barneaud","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfb637706e560160391f3a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2933918,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alexandre Landreau","original_name":"Alexandre Landreau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfb64a322b2b017c0770f4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4517810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Nouvian","original_name":"Claire Nouvian","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfb60860c751017b69ec50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562727,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Patrice Aubertel","original_name":"Patrice Aubertel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfb63e35db45017e1907d4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4540315,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"René Hauzey","original_name":"René Hauzey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfb645c8113d0180db5b37","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4540316,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aude Marche","original_name":"Aude Marche","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfb65325b955014b3fa3d8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1075798","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
