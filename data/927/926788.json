The Devils reveal a strong antagonism, both contemporary and mythological: they've declared war on humanity and have set out \"to capture all souls\", while Death heralds the end of mankind!  Combining lyricism, realism and irony, The Devil's Dream explores the soul of this paradoxical country. We discover not only the beauty of the landscape, the people and their creative imagination, but also the wretched conditions of life, the spectre of violence, and a pervasive sense of the absurd.  Guatemala is a society split between native and non-native, rich and poor, civil and military. Native people pick cotton for two dollars a day, their children work for half that amount. Those who dare to protest risk their lives. In this documentary, the people tell the story in their own words.","popularity":0.1416,"poster_path":"/hVN9kz915E3ouTgR7F5kuC4s13j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José María Ixcaya","original_name":"José María Ixcaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self (Archive footage)","credit_id":"634f756c56b9f70099349f9d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940500,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Symansky","original_name":"Adam Symansky","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f72a75f4b7300835afce1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747191,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Sherman","original_name":"Mark Sherman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f7495880c9200796badb3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747170,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Guillermo Escalon","original_name":"Guillermo Escalon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f70914ca67600825b0854","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747188,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Javier Leal","original_name":"Javier Leal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f7434d363e5007d03210d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2884471,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Denise Beaudoin","original_name":"Denise Beaudoin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f70c9d363e5007d031eaf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":235341,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmen Garcia","original_name":"Carmen Garcia","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1hvH2ZlW5gROOGa2ebu5t8w1nNK.jpg","credit_id":"634f71da56b9f7007b11cb5b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747180,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leopold Gutierrez","original_name":"Leopold Gutierrez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f7357f3b49a007dd1fa5f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747177,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Béland","original_name":"Pierre Béland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634f72fca57d43007a2dce61","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847628,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dennis R.
