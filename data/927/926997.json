A river of tears bursts its banks and washes the heroine away into a surreal world where symbols, references and personal experiences dance together. A baby learns to play the flute from a goose before becoming a girl and using the flute to drink up the river and swallow her teacher, the goose. A bone remains with which she draws herself a belly that gives birth to little creatures that suckle, swim, scream and explode and do all the other things that new-born babies do. In a pastel-coloured frenzy, the filmmaker traces the development from being an infant to an adult woman and artist.","popularity":0.0612,"poster_path":"/rC9K2RungZ3xC3k7WI6tjRahQnD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82153,"logo_path":"/mNEYX9oxFny6OOyb8083AKPbH8U.png","name":"Miyu
