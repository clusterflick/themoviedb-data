Within the shortest time, the flood catastrophe is taking its course: The regions around Kolbermoor, Deggendorf, and Passau are the hot spots. For the local population, these are dramatic days of hope and fear, for the aid workers it means work around the clock. In those days, Bavaria closed the ranks: Volunteers from all regions come in order to lend a hand and help. The Bayerische Fernsehen commemorates the dramatic days and weeks in the early summer of 2013 with the documentary “Die Jahrhundertflut” (“The flood of the century”).","popularity":0.3531,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Jahrhundertflut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380067,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ludwig Roll","original_name":"Ludwig Roll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61df0373cb308400429c4acc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380070,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andreas Bachmann","original_name":"Andreas Bachmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61df03a32811a1009d1a8ed2","department":"Crew","job":"Editorial Staff"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1919733,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ulrich Hagmann","original_name":"Ulrich Hagmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61df03300b5fd6001db44bcc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380066,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Salvan Joachim","original_name":"Salvan Joachim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61df03615bce9e001c9b9491","department":"Crew","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380068,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karin Haydu","original_name":"Karin Haydu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61df0386bf0f63001adecae8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380072,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stephan Keicher","original_name":"Stephan Keicher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61df03b1441b030041cbb196","department":"Crew","job":"Editorial Staff"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gloria Stenzel","original_name":"Gloria Stenzel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61df033de24b93008d4b1df4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2279,"name":"bavaria, germany"},{"id":173272,"name":"flood"},{"id":257783,"name":"2010s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
