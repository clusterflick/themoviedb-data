PEACE PARK is his first feature length documentary film, which shows an uncensored insider’s perspective of the communities that frequent the park and their struggle to survive Montreal’s attempts to gentrify its red-light district. It explores the ways the city and corporate interests view the people in the park, and looks at the way the two communities (the lifers and the skateboarders) manage to share the space through tolerance and respect.","popularity":0.5948,"poster_path":"/wxU54QBkiZtS3IQV9v766iR0JlH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peace Park","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3379172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bouthillier","original_name":"David Bouthillier","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61de3f098cfcc7008be5d405","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3375882,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Eric Lebeau","original_name":"Eric Lebeau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61de3f87945c2000406e6ad8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Rivard","original_name":"Charles Rivard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6pEVAokOUUvevQsjqVNd7Z7HD9r.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61de3f901d6c5f00960521a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3348139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gab Ekoe","original_name":"Gab Ekoe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1xFsdQlt2L5JIrYkKd4rFU3AWiw.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"61de3fb207291c009b3a7ba5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3379173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Labelle","original_name":"Carl Labelle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"61de3fd7945c200093bd0653","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1729905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Buffalo","original_name":"Joe Buffalo","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":"/n3JtVg0ox3RF7pYm1P4RALTK46m.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"61de3fde8cfcc700654ce59e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3379174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Johnson","original_name":"Aaron Johnson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/aL36GkE1LXsDsNZImxYQD4G00AL.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"61de3fefe24b930066851e78","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3379175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Cristofaro","original_name":"Will Cristofaro","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"61de3ffe6e0d72001b6e53f6","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3379172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bouthillier","original_name":"David Bouthillier","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61de3ed3a284eb001a0bd8e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3379172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bouthillier","original_name":"David Bouthillier","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61de3edc4c1d9a001c6bd3b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1348190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica McIntyre","original_name":"Jessica McIntyre","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61de3eeba284eb001a0bd955","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3348149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Lavoie","original_name":"Phil Lavoie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xMFgKNbt8r9sWBIOIBwrND0FCBQ.jpg","credit_id":"61de3f750dea6e001dce485d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2432184","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/avXpEyWNlKzFbS4o86fdVPuohS2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wxU54QBkiZtS3IQV9v766iR0JlH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Peace Park (2013) - Official Theatrical Trailer","key":"e0G7G22dyOg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-07-31T08:50:56.000Z","id":"61de40c3c525c4004239b18b"}]}}}
