The film deals with the history of the First Company of the Maidan, which defeated the enemy within and advanced to the frontlines to fight the external enemy. Immersion in the epicentre of events, a frank artistic and civilian view of human relationships against the background of violent social upheaval. Immutable human stories, the collision of charismatic characters, challenges and solutions on the verge of life and death, the search for interaction, the first steps towards the formation of civil society - All of this is summed up by an understanding of the way already travelled and an optimistic view of Ukraine's future.","popularity":0.0967,"poster_path":"/l3HqmjLn9th6D0AcgfSoZy3STrE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The First Company","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2441952,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yurii Hruzynov","original_name":"Yurii Hruzynov","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/22eUFmTw3LNMyx4AjqQO0ss9fau.jpg","credit_id":"61dfff87bf0f6300411b7693","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337430,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nikita Moiseev","original_name":"Nikita Moiseev","popularity":0.0779,"profile_path":"/ofEjN7FgkktB5SVV9T5PD2nxNab.jpg","credit_id":"61dfffd8e24b930066896116","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2441952,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yurii Hruzynov","original_name":"Yurii Hruzynov","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/22eUFmTw3LNMyx4AjqQO0ss9fau.jpg","credit_id":"61e000098cfcc7001cfcb047","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2584958,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yaroslav Pilunskyi","original_name":"Yaroslav Pilunskyi","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/aTfQWaUBMAbJbV05KlukmHfXgf6.jpg","credit_id":"61dfff98bf0f63009a12e441","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3189687,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yaroslav Nimyi","original_name":"Yaroslav Nimyi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e000182811a10041c01143","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2584958,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yaroslav Pilunskyi","original_name":"Yaroslav Pilunskyi","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/aTfQWaUBMAbJbV05KlukmHfXgf6.jpg","credit_id":"61dffff78cfcc7004121335f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2475901,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Kapustina","original_name":"Anna Kapustina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/aYgOE98nznxfjkOyCuOlelFPXub.jpg","credit_id":"61dfffc8e24b9300668960ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2441952,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yurii Hruzynov","original_name":"Yurii Hruzynov","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/22eUFmTw3LNMyx4AjqQO0ss9fau.jpg","credit_id":"61dfffe95bce9e009122442a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Shashkova","original_name":"Yuliya Shashkova","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637ffb6de8131d00be83f2a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9869952","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"266515903763005","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/l3HqmjLn9th6D0AcgfSoZy3STrE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BRUKIVKA Kamianets-Podilskyi International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2018-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
