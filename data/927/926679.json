Father O'Hara (Victor Banerjee), a missionary doctor with the help of his caretaker Maularam (Sudarshan Juyal), raises an orphan baby Josef (Hitesh Bisht). While still a young boy, Josef is sent to Dehradun, Uttarakhand, for his studies and vocational training. Josef (Subrat Dutta) returns back with a reputation as a great cook as well as his love for alcohol. The film explores in its unfolding of time, the different paths that Father O'Hara, Josef, and Maularam take in their respective journeys for spiritual fulfillment through memories, duty, and search as well as the their interaction with friends and acquaintances. Through static mis-en-scenes, the narrative of the film reflects the all-encompassing nature of time, pre-empting and repeating itself in allegorical hues.","popularity":0.1887,"poster_path":"/otpXo5gLKzlYad3CAQWfd5HK9DF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167838,"logo_path":null,"name":"UA Kathachitra","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A missionary doctor raises a boy","title":"Josef - Born in Grace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Subrat Dutta","original_name":"Subrat Dutta","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":"/49hCbFpWI3g02l00ohKg3rSzxlg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Josef","credit_id":"61e0885de24b9300668a990c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Banerjee","original_name":"Victor Banerjee","popularity":0.4362,"profile_path":"/rCwZMPlHUCnE6y4BRxzkVpx8NCx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Father O'Hara","credit_id":"61e0889bd8e2250042467730","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3381438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hitesh Bisht","original_name":"Hitesh Bisht","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Josef","credit_id":"61e0886c8cfcc70041227b50","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2020538,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sudarshan Juyal","original_name":"Sudarshan Juyal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Maularam","credit_id":"61e08886441b030090e9aa3d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3828198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anamika Goswami","original_name":"Anamika Goswami","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6397a8c3d05a030094f196d3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3828201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deepica Elizabeth Lakra","original_name":"Deepica Elizabeth Lakra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6397a8e39d592c0080aa6133","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3828202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debashish Sahu","original_name":"Debashish Sahu","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6397a8ff2cefc200a2fe3aae","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2632574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gautam Chattopadhyay","original_name":"Gautam Chattopadhyay","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6397a90a9d592c0091b421b4","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2669110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susant Misra","original_name":"Susant Misra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e087561511aa00696818ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3381442,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Umakanta Mahapatra","original_name":"Umakanta Mahapatra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e088b45bce9e00912385c2","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2020538,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sudarshan Juyal","original_name":"Sudarshan Juyal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e088fed8e2250068d379df","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2669110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susant Misra","original_name":"Susant Misra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e088c5cb30840098d90744","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3887781,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zakir Khan","original_name":"Zakir Khan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cee4a7071650007ce534df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11237638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":1998,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/otpXo5gLKzlYad3CAQWfd5HK9DF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1447},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vsRkJqjbuTZuXZSSBTcFd48gIBT.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":1998,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mcLJEsdVavjeDyeojUCh5a0ctat.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1447}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"LA","release_date":"2019-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
