Unlike \"A Study of Relationships Between Inner and Outer Space\" realized (also in 1969) by David Lamelas, which opens with a presentation of exhibition spaces, infrastructure and employees of Camden Arts Centre to then move into the city of London and its environs, Mutzenbecher's small odyssey remains contained in and limited to observation of the interiors of the Kunsthalle. The camera pans along the moulding profiles, captures corners of rooms and chevrons of parquet, looks up to skylights, passes through doors - in the complete absence of any exhibited artworks, the space is exposed to the point of exhaustion.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3xZq0qO2SxcTpvG7ippiChCzwJg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"II/69 Kunsthalle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1824907,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","original_name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/z0HvKg68ujOW6NC0N17gln4eY8h.jpg","credit_id":"61e0d87dc4f552009a3025c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3xZq0qO2SxcTpvG7ippiChCzwJg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
