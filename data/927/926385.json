The blanket is constructed from hundreds of everyday items collected from residential schools, churches, government buildings and cultural structures across Canada. Each object has a story to tell, each survivor has something to say. Narrated by the artist, this film weaves together those stories with his personal journey, examining how art can open our hearts to the pain of truth and the beauty of resiliency.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/sllpmbET2nd6UezreiIv24KBJlw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Picking Up the Pieces: The Making of the Witness Blanket","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carey Newman","original_name":"Carey Newman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61df489e441b030090e6c86c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3284800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cody Graham","original_name":"Cody Graham","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61df4891cb30840068e46368","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sllpmbET2nd6UezreiIv24KBJlw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"VIFF 2018","release_date":"2018-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Picking Up the Pieces: The Making of the Witness Blanket","key":"457804808","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-14T15:31:42.000Z","id":"61df48b78cfcc7001cfae499"}]}}}
