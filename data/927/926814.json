Hill creates this palindromic world as a site for excavation, uncovering new meanings and images by focusing on reversals and double reversals of spoken words and analogous actions. What ultimately can be seen as an inter-textual weaving of language, image, and time (or what Hill calls, “origami time”) exposes the archetypal protagonists of Noh drama: god, man, woman, lunatic, demon. These dramatis personae appear in and around a series of conceptual vignettes based on the Noh play Lady Aoi.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"URA ARU","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Hill","original_name":"Gary Hill","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e0f815eec4f3001ca30d30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
