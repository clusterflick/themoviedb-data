He tells the story through a poem, Picking Up The Pieces, written by myself Sharon Isaac. The film chronicles the journey through a series of black and white pictures taped on 16 mm film. The viewer then is taken to present day and comes full circle and showing a brighter future with the reclaiming of our culture, pride in our hair through braids, dancers, grandmother’s love, and language revitalization.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thunder Rolling Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5859501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sharon Isaac","original_name":"Sharon Isaac","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69334bc2eec5a4a4e9b70aaa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5859502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelsey Diamond","original_name":"Kelsey Diamond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69334bc92893ef371105cace","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
