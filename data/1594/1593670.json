Dealing with the endless, the infinite, waiting, and questions of God and self, these fragmentary narratives follow and diverge from classical Near Eastern storytelling traditions. The tales and images are cobbled together like dreams, making use of family archival Super8 from 1960s Baghdad, Hi8 from 1980s Chicago, and images captured by the artist in millennial California.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Parables","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3746663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"OK Pedersen","original_name":"OK Pedersen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69333b38eec5a4a4e9b70a58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
