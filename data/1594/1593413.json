Fighter follows Sara, who dreams of becoming a professional MMA athlete. She also dreams of Andrea. And even though their feelings are mutual, their relationship must remain a secret. Her father, whom she looks up to, expects Sara to one day take over the family-owned halal butcher shops and sees martial arts as nothing more than a hobby. The film explores multiple themes. It is about family love and loyalty, but it is also a journey into the unknown—one filled with desperation, sorrow, betrayal, and the hope of new beginnings.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":145767,"logo_path":"/h9uR2PcH9yyYsVt3iXD6YP4zj52.png","name":"Anagram Norge","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Fighter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3404841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Tjelta","original_name":"Sofia Tjelta","popularity":0.1303,"profile_path":"/3WBj8C8OSguUQQNYgtBvTRXso3i.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6932c813879ea7752f006db3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2967360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maja Christiansen","original_name":"Maja Christiansen","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":"/f9o3XGkneRE9PX4Ggpwa0lq721R.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6932c81e8b51aa59b08c44b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2570814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deniz Kaya","original_name":"Deniz Kaya","popularity":1.6319,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6932c825648501e3d702d990","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irasj Asanti","original_name":"Irasj Asanti","popularity":0.5326,"profile_path":"/lW2fehETBwhNED1gKLoTbd4UijU.jpg","credit_id":"6932c853f7659a068a02d999","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irasj Asanti","original_name":"Irasj Asanti","popularity":0.5326,"profile_path":"/lW2fehETBwhNED1gKLoTbd4UijU.jpg","credit_id":"6932c85f879ea7752f006db7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5858608,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nina Andersson","original_name":"Nina Andersson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6932c86ea8821c0bf58c4486","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1487103,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ole Marius Araldsen","original_name":"Ole Marius Araldsen","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/1Fd2jV9ffdlbXQrTuAr1VuIGCOz.jpg","credit_id":"6932c8853d748e4adc36e485","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663939,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mia Welin","original_name":"Mia Welin","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6932c890f7659a068a02d99c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
