Created and then manipulated in real time with the Fairlight CVI, and scored to haunting Senegalese music (with Peter Gordon on saxophone), Fitzgerald's painterly landscape suggests human and animal life, suffering, destruction and hope through a cacophony of shifting, organic shapes and bright colors. The sensuous and harrowing images coalesce to form a video lament of emotional power.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"video drawings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
