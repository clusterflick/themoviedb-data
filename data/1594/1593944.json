Already ashamed of his Australian accent, he has given up on speaking his family’s language due to being mocked by community members any time he says a word in Fiji Hindi. His cultural displacement comes to a head when he accidentally ruins his grandpa’s Hindu funeral ceremony, knocking the urn containing his ashes into the nearby creek.  Everything changes when, after a grocery shopping trip leads to mutual frustration, his sharp-tongued, non-English-speaking grandma hears Dev swear at a stranger and responds in kind. Their new secret language becomes a bridge across grief, a way back into culture and language, and the start of healing.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coconut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
