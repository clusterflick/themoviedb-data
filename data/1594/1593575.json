In it, we hear the letters her mother sent her from Europe while we see these long, static shots of the city. I thought about how I never really told you things.

I thought about how often you asked me to stay in touch.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2025-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reportaje","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5619126,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vicente González Monroy","original_name":"Vicente González Monroy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6933110086f55b6dd517a930","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
