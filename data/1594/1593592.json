I write to a woman no longer here: Soraya Cataño, murdered in Medellín in 1991. Thirty years later, I find her in an image. Her voice rises as a parade climbs the hillside. The archive reveals her laughter, her gesture, and I choose to call her forth.I too was raised in this valley.  I too believed. I believe. This film is not about death. It is a dialogue between the one who narrates and the one who resists through absence. It is a fire that does not fade.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2025-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fire of This Moon Shall Not Wane","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5859094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastián Pérez Arbeláez","original_name":"Sebastián Pérez Arbeláez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6933165308827f406d70a439","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
