Desperate measures were taken to reduce its spread: executions became routine, and a dome was built around the community. In the years that followed, 10 doomed plague victims foretold that only one person, untouched by disease, would escape.  In the present day, on the desert outskirts of the colony, a masked gunman approaches the edge of the dome. Carrying a bottle of blood and a large egg inexplicably pulled from a mountain of corpses, he sprints past imposing fortifications – along with hundreds of sad-looking soldiers, a ginormous laser and a man so caked in disease that his skin acts like Kevlar – on a mission to fulfil the prophecy.","popularity":0.15,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Short","title":"And They Will Be Relentless","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5857602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hunter Kelly","original_name":"Hunter Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693210c5b62d7019e5c43998","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
