Here legends are born... and innocence dies.\r Three seasoned witchers — Vesemir, Osmund and Reinald — carry the burden of an ancient legacy as they train four young boys: George, Tomas, Eskel and Geralt; to become witchers. These children are not learning swordplay for glory, they are being prepared for the brutal and unforgiving trials that too few survive.  As the boys form bonds of brotherhood and cling to hope, their mentors struggle with the haunting truth that not all boys will survive. Bound by duty but torn by emotion, the witchers must harden their hearts or risk being broken by the inevitable losses to come.  This is not a tale of heroes. It’s a story of sacrifice, survival, and the cost of becoming a monster to fight monsters.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where witchers are born… and innocence dies.","title":"Witcher: School of the Wolf - Chapters 1 and 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
