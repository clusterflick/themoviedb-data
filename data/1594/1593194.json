Narrative remains, but with a bastardized and disoriented aftereffect, which transforms it into another way of experiencing it. The spree killings of Billy Cook (portrayed in Lupina’s film by the actor William Talman, and renamed Emmett Myers) are looked at more as a moment in time that begins and ends with vague qualities much like a dream, or an experience of weather in Robert Musil’s The Man Without Qualities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4xuHr7iT6GIU6D9MrO8OdAWWKo0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atmospheric Offence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Swiezynski","original_name":"Matthew Swiezynski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69322920398194511936e213","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Swiezynski","original_name":"Matthew Swiezynski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6932293349294fe043006bff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Swiezynski","original_name":"Matthew Swiezynski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69322942c49897c332fdc508","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4xuHr7iT6GIU6D9MrO8OdAWWKo0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Atmospheric Offence","key":"V6aUTevGzZ4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-12-04T19:08:32.000Z","id":"69322c0b5d157d6ee102d6ff"}]}}}
