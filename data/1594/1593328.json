He is preoccupied with his constantly fighting parents, his secret crush on Rotem, and even the looming presence of world hunger (which, ironically, doesn't concern him much). To celebrate his birthday, his sister makes him a bold promise: all of his wishes will magically come true. Suddenly, the most fantastical events begin to unfold. Is it possible that the world, which Zoar knows to be realistic and devoid of magic, is truly changing? This amusing coming-of-age comedy, created in 2007 as a high school graduation project, won first place in a national pitching competition for Best Screenplay.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Birthday from the Movies","title":"A Birthday from the Movies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
