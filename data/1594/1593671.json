It focuses on two woodcarvers from Bhaktapur engaged in the restoration and rebuilding of the early 18th century Harishankara temple on Patan Darbar Square. The artist has chosen to use various recording techniques to aurally and visually convey the tactility involved in this woodcraft.  Attaching a microphone to the surface of the wood, the sound of the carvers' hammering is heard traveling through the material itself, the way a medical doctors' stethoscope picks up a heartbeat.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Drawing the listener into the repetitive thumping sound of each beat, the camera gets close too, almost touching the wood carvings and ritually-imbued chisels.","title":"CLOSE UP: A SET OF RESONATING CARVING CHISELS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5859420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Britt Hatzius","original_name":"Britt Hatzius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69333a9b59526bd60e17a9f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
