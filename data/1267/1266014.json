The scene is set by a gentle hum of jazz and the tapping of raindrops. The story follows the protagonist, a rogue private investigator, who feels like working this job has him stuck in a never-ending loop. His loneliness has led to delusion and violence. Every ring of his phone, he's in high hopes that he will pick it up to be his 'lover' - instead, it's just another case for him to solve. Scenes become faster and clips start to repeat, the man is under crushing stress.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/e9Tu5kFXABqybC0zasTMFM1QTXB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miss Dial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4620838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Rowe","original_name":"Thomas Rowe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Investigator","credit_id":"6605d385a6ddcb016343fa5e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4620839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lewi Mumford","original_name":"Lewi Mumford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narration","credit_id":"6605d3942faf4d0164c617d7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4620835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louie Ashill","original_name":"Louie Ashill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6605d2efa6ddcb016343fa05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4620835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louie Ashill","original_name":"Louie Ashill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6605d3f7f9183a016646a863","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4620880,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rhys Atkinson","original_name":"Rhys Atkinson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6605df6aa6ddcb017c440981","department":"Art","job":"Daily Grip"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e9Tu5kFXABqybC0zasTMFM1QTXB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1203}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
