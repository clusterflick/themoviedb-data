He was a kind and respected man who helped everyone in everything. Before his death, the old man said that his heart should be transplanted to a sick person in need. Now Didar dreams about his father every night — the deceased asks for help. Didar finds out who got his father's heart, and together with his sister's brother and Zheng, he flies to the capital to the new owner. It turns out that the heart was transplanted to a very difficult person. This is the criminal authority Andrei, who killed hundreds, maybe thousands of people. It was only after the operation that the seasoned bandit began to change, acquiring the character traits of Kayyrbek agha. And now other bandits want to kill Andrei, who decided to quit crime.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ksBljxxAngVg25Ulo8LugGaZL9F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2023-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Road to the Father","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Дорога к отцу","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5284326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raikhan Kalioldina","original_name":"Raikhan Kalioldina","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/p4nnoaoMgd9GUkIN4ddaljmXkpC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67c83f9a73b7f95da9c2a449","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3427162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timur Dulatov","original_name":"Timur Dulatov","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66063ddc8a0e9b01624c2074","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ksBljxxAngVg25Ulo8LugGaZL9F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1173,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/9osVl1rF7PuCpN1RHujMKbXOae5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":782}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
