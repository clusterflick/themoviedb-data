The unnamed sex worker (Emily E) experiences endless bounds of degradation, torture and perversion. Jack Mulvanerty’s film claws its way through new depths of sadism, nihilism, cruelty and how one becomes mercilessly disemboweled by our society’s unrelenting and all-consuming system of capitalism, objectification and demoralizing exploitation. Everything Decays features unsimulated graphic acts of sex and violence. Blood and bodily fluids were in fact spilled in creating this work depicting the sickeningly consuming nature of humanity and society as we know it. Director Jack Mulvanerty (Scarlet Piss Princess, Split) guides you through deep waters of nihilism and perversion.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zeorA9Jc1f75uiqdYTTDg7ExfyT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Decays","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":2903,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zeorA9Jc1f75uiqdYTTDg7ExfyT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1947}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
