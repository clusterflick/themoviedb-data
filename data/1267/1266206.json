It is a huge province completely covered with white plastic, harbouring Europe’s largest vegetable garden. It is the place where our tomatoes come from, even in winter. But under all the plastic, strange things happen… Today, the vegetable garden inevitably moves to Morocco. Spanish farmers dive well under their prices to keep in the race. 120.000 migrants work in slave-like conditions on the plantations.","popularity":0.1215,"poster_path":"/yGjCsUCKsvnHpyHn0AwAExz88rr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109423,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cassette for
