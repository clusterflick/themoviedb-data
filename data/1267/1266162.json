He no longer imagines life in another country, although he knows that his roots lead to the Kazakhs. His father abandoned him, his only son, when he was still very young. The young man does not even know his name, but the information about the lost relative reminded him of himself. The guy decided to meet with Junus, who, according to the letter, was near death. The man decided to transfer all the modest inheritance to his offspring, whom he had not seen for almost thirty years.
