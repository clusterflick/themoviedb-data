Norman Kaye and Paul Cox first met in Melbourne in 1967. Norman, a music teacher and 'after hours' actor and Paul, a stills photographer, discovered in each other a mutual desire to explore their ideas and dreams through film. So began a 36-year working relationship that ceased only as the curtains of Alzheimer's Disease gradually closed around Kaye. There are few films by Paul Cox that are without some significant contribution, on-screen or off, by Kaye. Whether as lead actor or in a supporting role; as composer or performer, Kaye influenced everyone around him with guileless enthusiasm and humour. The Remarkable Mr Kaye includes film extracts and personal memories in a moving film that is homage to friendship and a creative partnership that shaped and changed Paul Cox's life.","popularity":0.0994,"poster_path":"/tJd5KQNMKt8uUFs28NOkpelPkGR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Remarkable Mr. Kaye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Cox","original_name":"Paul Cox","popularity":0.2115,"profile_path":"/wMRDxbIIi42Y54gy6NNV3pQ0aNR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"6605fd118a0e9b01624bdc8e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Kaye","original_name":"Norman Kaye","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/iwVZinCQWqYAgPRZQBGGSr4La1b.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6605fd1f303c850163b7d165","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":958887,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Grabowsky","original_name":"Paul Grabowsky","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6605fccb2faf4d0164c6280f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621084,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tim Lewis","original_name":"Tim Lewis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6605fcf2590086017cb5fa61","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621080,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Patterson","original_name":"Mark Patterson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6605fc810d417e01630351da","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621083,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Margot Saloman","original_name":"Margot Saloman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6605fca7303c85017cb7e377","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Cox","original_name":"Paul Cox","popularity":0.2115,"profile_path":"/wMRDxbIIi42Y54gy6NNV3pQ0aNR.jpg","credit_id":"6605fc50a6ddcb01634409aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2866072","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tJd5KQNMKt8uUFs28NOkpelPkGR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
