The artists created a candidate who was a computer program, so-called Citizen Election Software (OSW, Obywatelski Software Wyborczy). Wiktoria Cukt represented the views of everyone who decided to choose her as a representative of their views. She demonstrated a faith in direct, participatory democracy without unnecessary, harmful middlemen, which CUKT considered politicians to be. Wiktoria Cukt's campaign slogan was: “Politicians are useless”. Each time a campaign office for Wiktoria Cukt was opened, there was a rave party. The parties were an occasion to round up Wiktoria's policies – what people wanted her to say. CUKT members also gathered signatures for her official candidacy and membership declarations for the Wiktoria Cukt political party.","popularity":0.058,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wiktoria Cukt's Presidental Campaign","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Artur Kozdowski","original_name":"Artur Kozdowski","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66067546f9183a014c46d1e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikołaj Jurkowski","original_name":"Mikołaj Jurkowski","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660675348a0e9b01624c44e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piotr Wyrzykowski","original_name":"Piotr Wyrzykowski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66067584303c85017cb8d90d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafał Ewertowski","original_name":"Rafał Ewertowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66067520f9183a01664709d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacek Niegoda","original_name":"Jacek Niegoda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6606755dd4fe04014926cfe2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maciej Sienkiewicz","original_name":"Maciej Sienkiewicz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66067572f9183a017f477cab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
