Cinema is a ghostlike medium that record its expression through lenses. I collected the types of forms in which light escapes itself from the surface of object through the manipulation of the lens, or observe the dance of light pieces that stick to the surface of the lens. What is seen is light reflected from the surface of things, not the things themselves. Through cinema, I try to create a rhythm of non-existence created by remnants of light recorded in it.  A story in which light is separated from things, escaping, staying on the surface, floating, talking, captured and dissipating.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/u7vv5aCAKVjMkfnv7iJP2TCgsLC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Afterglow Part.1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2213717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeon Junehyuck","original_name":"Jeon Junehyuck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6606bc17590086017cb7495e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u7vv5aCAKVjMkfnv7iJP2TCgsLC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
