A small part of the Muslim population joined the Gestapo and supported the Germans. They decided to attack the Orthodox village of Buđevo together and burn it to the ground. Although most Muslims were against it, it happened anyway. The strongest opponent to this was Hako Duljević, an honorable man from the Pešter village of Međugor. He saved the girl Ratomirka Minić from certain death, taking her to safety in the village of Doliće. Ultimately, she reunited with her parents and lived a ripe old age. The Germans didn't forgive Hako and shot him in the back. That truth did not come to light for eighty years, and his family still suffers, especially his grandson named after him.","popularity":0.0885,"poster_path":"/8CEQ48vJDGJrj0LwGqAuMnKHfXi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hako","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4624636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hako Duljević","original_name":"Hako Duljević","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6608559da6ddcb016345f0ea","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josip Pejaković","original_name":"Josip Pejaković","popularity":0.1183,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660854c3e62719017c0dc79b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1714,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8CEQ48vJDGJrj0LwGqAuMnKHfXi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
