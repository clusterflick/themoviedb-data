From 2015-2020, his daughter, filmmaker Lex Helgerson, follows him with a camera in order to attempt intimacy with the man who raised her. What she gets are his projected anxieties and his struggles with physical age and emotional distress, all while he trains for the Boston Marathon.  Uniquely piecing together dozens of voicemails and old home movies, universal questions about the parent child relationship drive the story. Helgerson offers a complex portrait of a man, her father: a Coca Cola guzzling, pizza loving, never-stretched-a-day-in-his-life-marathoner. Ripe with humor and heart, Age Group Winner reminds us there is beauty in pain, and in getting to know our parents, we may better understand ourselves.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Age Group Winner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20405736","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
