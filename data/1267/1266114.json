Their values, art, music, gods and legends reach back thousands of years to ancient Polynesia, where they lived before sailing to the islands we know as Hawai‘'i.  Recently, there have been efforts to revitalize these traditions and teach them to young Hawaiians. Hawai'i: Continuing Traditions looks at ways in which the “\"spirit of the land\" lives today, as we explore special places, where old ways are thriving in the modern world.  Visit a working taro plantation in Maui and an isolated fishing village on the isalnd of Hawai‘'i.
