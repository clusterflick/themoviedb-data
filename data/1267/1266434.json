The IDF was sent in to quash the uprising and before long, TV screens across the country were inundated with footage of burning tyres, stones thrown about, and baton-wielding Israeli soldiers chasing after teens and children. In the face of this new reality that made the question of the Occupied Territories the single most pressing issue of the time, the Jerusalem Film Festival went ahead and commissioned the following project. The result is a classic, Heffner-esque film – an intelligent labyrinth containing the most fundamental of Israeli tropes: The Holocaust; Arabs; us vs. them – all of which find themselves clashing and intermingling, and ultimately rendering the viewers helpless and cringing with awkwardness.","popularity":0.0987,"poster_path":"/gKj5vHyf2x6W0vLYWVQLi2z7M3m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Israel Film Archive","origin_country":""},{"id":224789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jerusalem Cinemateque","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dissolves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alisa Rozen","original_name":"Alisa Rozen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6607334fe1faed017dfad0a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":536822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilan Dar","original_name":"Ilan Dar","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":"/2kaA1snv0Z1qzPQ1i4DxCWpzmsy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6607335ee6271901490bd1a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115961,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yoav Goren","original_name":"Yoav Goren","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"660733672faf4d0164c73a4a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yitzhak Laor","original_name":"Yitzhak Laor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66073371e1faed0164fa29ca","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1301953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Avraham Heffner","original_name":"Avraham Heffner","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6606e7d78a0e9b017c4d6e42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":47104,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Avi Koren","original_name":"Avi Koren","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66073340e6271901490bd18f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4064218,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Effi Atad","original_name":"Effi Atad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660733905900860130b5fde7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":161,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amir Harel","original_name":"Amir Harel","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660736532faf4d017dc8266e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gKj5vHyf2x6W0vLYWVQLi2z7M3m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
