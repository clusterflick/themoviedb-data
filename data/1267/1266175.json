In this hopeless situation, the farmer's daughter Joan announces that God has commissioned her to liberate Orléans. The ‘Maid of Orléans’ may be victorious in battle but loses her heart in passion to a Burgundian knight, Lionel. The flames consume a woman torn between love and her divine mission.","popularity":0.0981,"poster_path":"/1vl6ySimuumCuMqVrwooGUUvLg0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":146,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Maid of Orleans -  Deutsche Oper am Rhein","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Kataeva","original_name":"Maria Kataeva","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Joan of Arc","credit_id":"660656d95900860163b64e88","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sami Luttinen","original_name":"Sami Luttinen","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Thibaut d'Arc","credit_id":"660656ef303c850163b83015","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandr Nesterenko","original_name":"Aleksandr Nesterenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Raymond","credit_id":"660656ff0d417e014903650f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergej Khomov","original_name":"Sergej Khomov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Charles VII","credit_id":"660657138a0e9b01624c32e4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luiza Fatyol","original_name":"Luiza Fatyol","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Agnes Sorel","credit_id":"660657252faf4d0164c68d6f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thorsten Grümbel","original_name":"Thorsten Grümbel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Archbishop","credit_id":"6606573da894d6013061ddcf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evez Abdulla","original_name":"Evez Abdulla","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Dunois","credit_id":"6606574f283ed9017c1866fc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Šveda","original_name":"Richard Šveda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Lionel","credit_id":"6606575e5900860163b64f35","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beniamin Pop","original_name":"Beniamin Pop","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Bertrand","credit_id":"66065776f9183a017f475a51","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Preißinger","original_name":"Johannes Preißinger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Confessor","credit_id":"6606578bf9183a017f475a7c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Žilvinas Miškinis","original_name":"Žilvinas Miškinis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Lauret","credit_id":"6606579cfdf8b7017df2cd8c","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mara Guseynova","original_name":"Mara Guseynova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Angel","credit_id":"660657aa021cee013046dff1","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2813790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elisabeth Stöppler","original_name":"Elisabeth Stöppler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660656c3d4fe04013026b11e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pyotr Tchaikovsky","original_name":"Пётр Чайковский","popularity":0.4961,"profile_path":"/zTnrtuLddN6KYU3gVVepEiAsgek.jpg","credit_id":"660656afa894d60162624a78","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1vl6ySimuumCuMqVrwooGUUvLg0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
