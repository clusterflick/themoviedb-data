Electropop queen Zara Larsson performs songs from her fourth studio album 'Venus', alongside fan-favourites 'Lush Life', 'I Would Like', 'Never Forget You' and 'Symphony', on her first European tour since 2019. Captured on 26 February 2024 at AFAS Live, the show features luscious pastel and magenta stage lighting, ethereal orbital-like visuals, a powerful female collective of musicians and dancers, plus all the frills and sparkle. Shooting to multi-platinum stardom over the past decade, Zara continues her reign of 'mothering' - sorry - owning the stage as if it were her last concert, radiating confidence, charm, and (unsurprisingly) some pretty killer dance moves in front of thousands of fans.","popularity":0.6123,"poster_path":"/tbG0XijVYNouA665LHCqzLEogZj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":256301,"logo_path":null,"name":"On Air","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Experience Zara Larsson's majestical, sold-out performance at AFAS Live in Amsterdam â€“ available now in cinematic quality.","title":"Zara Larsson 'Venus Tour'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1689254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zara Larsson","original_name":"Zara Larsson","popularity":0.2585,"profile_path":"/p0JzomnJqCo6i122XOg5x8KiKQP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6606dc568a0e9b017c4d600f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Gitsels","original_name":"Jan Gitsels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6606e2fda6ddcb017c458f59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4969239,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jakub Krampl","original_name":"Jakub Krampl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f8a1dbe7d24ebb2ba235be","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4969241,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marco Verhoek","original_name":"Marco Verhoek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f8a206271200492ecc2e5d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4969245,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthijs Iseger","original_name":"Matthijs Iseger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f8a306393cda1d1dcc31ca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4969287,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kiki The-Arends","original_name":"Kiki The-Arends","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f8b3632c4bdc9db05f5187","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4969245,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthijs Iseger","original_name":"Matthijs Iseger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f8b3d3f5d56e9ed8a22fcc","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31898006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wC6uHcYnHrlDDGfsh2mGh33PNn7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mGksX64cJR8S9laxprexoHYcbgr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tbG0XijVYNouA665LHCqzLEogZj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9EAsNSFtxqUls1b3B3fVxF61hgH.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33922,"name":"pop music"},{"id":156205,"name":"concert film"},{"id":198299,"name":"live music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Zara Larsson 'Venus Tour' Live Concert Stream [Official Trailer] (On Air)","key":"WRdwE_o401s","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-03-27T17:55:56.000Z","id":"6606e36ad5191f01642fa1b5"}]}}}
