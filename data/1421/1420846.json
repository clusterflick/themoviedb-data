Her loneliness has driven her to seek love with her next door neighbor, George. George, a widower, is dealing with his own loneliness and the beginnings of dementia. Grace decides to court George with homemade dinners, playful disguises, and an adventure to an art gallery. When she arrives at the gallery in one of her disguises, George panics, and Grace realizes that she is failing in her effort to win him over. George then refuses to see her, and he suffers a serious health issue. Adult Protective Services tries to step in to remove George from his home, but plotting together Grace and George come up with a plan. In the end, Graceâ€™s heroic and comic efforts save George, and they both realize that they were made for each other.","popularity":0.0479,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":250848,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vintage Moxie
