Experience a ‘ravishing fusion of flamboyancy and fun’ (Guardian) in the RSC’s smash-hit sell-out production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream.  Four young lovers, faced with the prospect of unhappy marriage or worse, flee the court of Athens and stumble into an enchanted forest. Nearby, a group of amateur actors rehearse a play to celebrate an upcoming royal wedding. As these mere mortals cross paths with a warring fairy King and Queen, chaos reigns in the natural world. The lines between reality and illusion start to blur and no one but mischievous Puck knows what is true and what is magic. Let Shakespeare’s captivating comedy transport you to the most magical of midsummer nights.  Director Eleanor Rhode returns to the RSC with a ‘joyous’ (The Times) Dream that is magical, mischievous and full of wonder.","popularity":0.5886,"poster_path":"/6RK0I6MhCi93F4m5g6UAX0WOSid.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5845,"logo_path":"/5ncpOZ3B1Jlb7XnMJlBho1BHCIs.png","name":"Royal Shakespeare
