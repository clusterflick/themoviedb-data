The film is concerned with the response of her contemporaries to her behaviour on the night before she died, and by situating this within the fictional circumstances of a modern woman, explores current attitudes to rape, and the forces and assumptions underlying them.","popularity":0.3,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":104781,"logo_path":null,"name":"Birmingham Film and Video
