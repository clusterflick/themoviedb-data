But as they grow older, their lives take different turns. Marlon leaves for university in London, while Murry, facing mounting pressure at home, makes choices that lead to prison. Through years of home video, Murewa reflects on the complexities of growing up, and how opportunity and circumstance shape the futures of young people in ways they don’t fully grasp at the time. Intimate and deeply personal, the film explores boyhood, belonging and the lingering question of what might have been.","popularity":0.0841,"poster_path":"/fw312Bo1L0kaHlqRBfRJClMB8iP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167736,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fee Fie
