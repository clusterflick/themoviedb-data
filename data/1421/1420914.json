What happens to land in the absence of farmers? What happens to villages in the absence of men? Sent Away Boys weaves together stories of individual ambitions and family biographies from Punjab (India) to chronicle the gradual transformation of agrarian landscape and patriarchal traditions through ongoing transnational migration. As the promise of a secure future in agriculture grows increasingly uncertain for young men across the region, escaping India to join the low-wage labor in countries like Canada and USA becomes their sole aspiration. In rural Punjab, being a successful man now entails leaving their village, traveling abroad, and sending money home. Through interviews with men preparing to undertake often risky journeys and women awaiting the return of their sons, brothers and husbands, Sent Away Boys shows how young men's decisions to emigrate implicate families and communities across North India.","popularity":0.247,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Punjabi","iso_639_1":"pa","name":"ਪੰਜਾਬੀ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sent Away Boys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sukvir Kaur Dhillon","original_name":"Sukvir Kaur Dhillon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678ecc604b96e0ea5f432288","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Surjit Kaur Brar","original_name":"Surjit Kaur Brar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678ecc6ee4566399a26e3e42","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gurkirpal Singh Grewal","original_name":"Gurkirpal Singh Grewal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678ecc823da8b1a9ac64d54c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ishwerjot Singh Rana","original_name":"Ishwerjot Singh Rana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678ecc8f4b96e0ea5f4322a6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Radhika Chopra","original_name":"Radhika Chopra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678ecc9f5add61273d656a10","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harjant Gill","original_name":"Harjant Gill","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ecb453da8b1a9ac64d49e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kulwinder Harsahai","original_name":"Kulwinder Harsahai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ecb6642f27c754c655ce2","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4535449,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rajiv Mehrotra","original_name":"Rajiv Mehrotra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ecb9de4566399a26e3da7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3577475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tulika Srivastava","original_name":"Tulika Srivastava","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/86aA3qdkayKKaOd0lPaHU9T8wPm.jpg","credit_id":"678ecbb868e0d873636e3f04","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4094886,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ridhima Mehra","original_name":"Ridhima Mehra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ecbca3da8b1a9ac64d4c0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192802,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pearl Sandhu","original_name":"Pearl Sandhu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ecbf33da8b1a9ac64d4f1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192804,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sonali Udaybabu","original_name":"Sonali Udaybabu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ecc1e42f27c754c655d10","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harjant Gill","original_name":"Harjant Gill","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ecc303da8b1a9ac64d51f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6337,"name":"patriarchy"},{"id":1729,"name":"migration"},{"id":159299,"name":"punjab"},{"id":159304,"name":"punjab, india"},{"id":162710,"name":"culture"},{"id":251216,"name":"transnational"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
