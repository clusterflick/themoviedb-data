Upon his return home, he committed suicide, leaving behind nearly twenty hours of video diaries recorded over nine months as evidence of his actions. The diaries not only captured the building of the letter bomb, but also López's personal thoughts on his life, his family, and his sanity. Twenty years after these diaries were discovered, they shock and fascinate curious viewers in an online world.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":89763,"logo_path":null,"name":"Method M Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The best of me.MP4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The best of me MP4","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo López","original_name":"Ricardo López","popularity":0.1029,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"678ee2a6e93bd071355b280b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael English","original_name":"Michael English","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ee302449bb9688baaa257","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael English","original_name":"Michael English","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ee311b4ef11284ff07012","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192899,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Greene","original_name":"Robert Greene","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ee327b4ef11284ff07028","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3552463,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stacey Woelfel","original_name":"Stacey Woelfel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ee354449bb9688baaa27f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192900,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Heiss","original_name":"Andrea Heiss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ee37a437589f3865b2743","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael English","original_name":"Michael English","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ee3b1f87f4119e6aaa363","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192911,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Howard Whiddett","original_name":"Howard Whiddett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ee3bfb4ef11284ff07088","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Stronger Than Fiction 2018","release_date":"2018-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"St. Louis International Film Festival 2018","release_date":"2018-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
