The TV movie focuses on the period of the late 16th century in France, ravaged by religious wars, and highlights the efforts of Catherine de Medici to defend the throne of her sons and maintain the unity of the kingdom. The role of Catherine de Medici in this TV movie is an interpretation that gives more humanity to this historical figure often presented in a negative light in history.","popularity":0.2085,"poster_path":"/aZtLllNXzLanNJ1mXSPsuuSI9Fk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11359,"logo_path":"/aqWJRi66t2oMPMmC60CdK9I3WQd.png","name":"France 2","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":164,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"History, Biography, France, 16th Century, TV Movie","title":"Catherine de Médicis","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Sapritch","original_name":"Alice Sapritch","popularity":0.3752,"profile_path":"/ve8ggaumg6jkKIXUP3ePCC0Q0zK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Catherine de Médicis","credit_id":"678d07a2d094ea7af1433cb6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5189737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Gauthier","original_name":"Vincent Gauthier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Charles IX","credit_id":"678d07bca93ce48bca432c1a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Gauthier","original_name":"Vincent Gauthier","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/tqj3kPGySAu58WxmJ2vq2aKAO2u.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bezons","credit_id":"678d080a68e0d873636dfea8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Thorent","original_name":"André Thorent","popularity":0.1897,"profile_path":"/vC6GyqEA5AXaYsf4E0mhWAV7Hze.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tavannes","credit_id":"678d083e5add61273d6521ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Dalric","original_name":"Jean Dalric","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":"/lDoYd2tPelqo97B5HNQ32LkEcff.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Duke Henri d'Anjou","credit_id":"678d089742f27c754c6518de","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Gélinas","original_name":"Isabelle Gélinas","popularity":0.3335,"profile_path":"/xdoOUJxr1RoCVsBxSNObftAvBGr.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marguerite de Valois","credit_id":"678d08d81c341c88996dbe54","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves-André Hubert","original_name":"Yves-André Hubert","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678d0aa12e41634e526515cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5013164,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Orieux","original_name":"Jean Orieux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678d0acc859fb4e6a86df632","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2554550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Savatier","original_name":"Paul Savatier","popularity":0.1708,"profile_path":"/rCddbB0nTgLVYvWKjuR6i1YVBXQ.jpg","credit_id":"678d0b45a93ce48bca432d69","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0123008","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1722,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pt4Midvm1iorq4AP1S35iFggIIw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3061}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1758,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aZtLllNXzLanNJ1mXSPsuuSI9Fk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1250}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":197963,"name":"renaissance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1989-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
