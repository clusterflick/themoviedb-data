A family is at war, but Shay’s attention is turned somewhere else, reconnecting with his boyhood friend, Ruairi. But times have changed, as have they, and they are drawn passionately together while tensions build up against them. Worlds collide on his God-fearing father’s farm; religious trauma erupts back to the surface and Shay’s struggles with self-acceptance of his sexuality may be more than he can bear.\r Just as he is on the brink of discovering himself through falling in love, he becomes trapped between the judgement of his father and the guilt of a moralistic God, he must return to a childhood sanctuary to set himself free.","popularity":0.4039,"poster_path":"/5g9UXJunnyN7WDdTijg8m9SW8TD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Your
