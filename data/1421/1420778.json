He carefully sifts sand from the rock and washes it repeatedly, hoping to find even tiny pieces of gold. On good days, he finds gold the size of a needle, but on bad days, he finds nothing. Despite his struggles, he remains convinced that gold lies beneath the clear water. However, he is worried about losing his home when a reservoir is built in the area.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hope for Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5192227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xiaowei Meng","original_name":"Xiaowei Meng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678e8ec59cb0719f746502e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"YunFest","release_date":"2011-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
