Sixty years after starting out as a photographer, McCullin returns to his old haunts in the East End of London, Bradford, Consett, Eastbourne and Scarborough. Along the way he encounters an array of English characters at the Glyndebourne Festival and Goodwood Revival and photographs a hunt and a group of saboteurs aiming to disrupt them. McCullinâ€™s journey is punctuated by scenes in his darkroom, a place he is allowing cameras into for the first time.","popularity":0.1016,"poster_path":"/eNSvKcRrZZS8pjziHbjIDTNlIgU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don McCullin: Looking for England","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1522751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don McCullin","original_name":"Don McCullin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/uTqE9fZM2KfJRFjiLq4araODvw1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c6ece4b9251417aa210a2ec","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Sibley","original_name":"Adrian Sibley","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6ece61c3a3684f97ef76f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jMTKmIfODvLCHukB3WS1UBSM5tC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eNSvKcRrZZS8pjziHbjIDTNlIgU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":586}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
