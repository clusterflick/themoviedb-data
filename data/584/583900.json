Between those early works and MERCI, Hindle was sought to film the Winter Olympics, 150 short works for Westinghouse/CBS, and the South Sea voyages of Sterling Hayden's schooner, \"Wanderer.\" The inability to get on with his own work produced MERCI. A poignant comment concerning the film artist's dilemma. Aftermaths of Western Civilization. Including never-seen-elsewhere Nazi footage inserts.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/xUA6hZRLba8ihviw9esdWFyHTjf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"29: Merci, Merci","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1496717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Will Hindle","original_name":"Will Hindle","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/y7SedAsS8GNrfxGL39jjvm9pJCW.jpg","credit_id":"5c6ef9469251413ad3fc2ca1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":957,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xUA6hZRLba8ihviw9esdWFyHTjf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":638}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
