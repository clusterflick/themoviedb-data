The 1968 documentary captures Bootstrap’s mission of economic development with scenes of women and men training for a range of employment opportunities including how to operate power sewing machines for work in the local garment factory, to the new technologies of the day, the IBM keypunch machines. Especially engaging are the scenes of “sensitivity sessions” hosted by the organization, where black and white Angelenos debate issues of race and racism in 1960s America. The film’s cinéma-vérité style allows for a certain closeness with its subject and allows for a precious time capsule glimpse into this vibrant and struggling community.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":114996,"logo_path":null,"name":"Educational Communications Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Operation Bootstrap","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4106116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Hall","original_name":"Robert Hall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6484e851e27260012879e464","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1937890,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Carey","original_name":"Charles Carey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6b0ed7c3a36848f1db0fd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2245190,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"James Bryant","original_name":"James Bryant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6b0ef9c3a3684f97e6db00","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1937889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Altina Carey","original_name":"Altina Carey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6b0f149251417aa207ec9d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2245191,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alex Van Der Kar","original_name":"Alex Van Der Kar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6b0f070e0a266daca759f8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1937889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Altina Carey","original_name":"Altina Carey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6b0ee30e0a262b349aca7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
