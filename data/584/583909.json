The experiment is then repeated in green, then in light red, next blue, and finally pale yellow. It’s a very Hitchcockian approach to creating meaning, as if all the elements - object, colour, space and time - had been isolated from the suspense, only to be reconstructed anew, creating silent, artificial drama. And, as with Hitchcock, the motifs are fetishistically charged: knife, dog, door, bird, lion: ‘...they are all Freudian in some sense’, observed Goldstein.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fT8p1IlF2n9JAsYBo1UvKEmUb46.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Knife","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Goldstein","original_name":"Jack Goldstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6eff700e0a261e06a5ce9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fT8p1IlF2n9JAsYBo1UvKEmUb46.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":832}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
