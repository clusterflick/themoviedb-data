The film uses a poetic approach towards personal domestic space, searching for calm and serene moments of contemplation. The sounds of the public sphere, represented by contemporaneous radio news broadcasts, provide an auditory counterpoint.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gIDM0UdhhmBrzcdXmjHZwb93wkG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Windows onto Montebello Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2247463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Turano","original_name":"Paul Turano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6f46840e0a26239cd37563","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1549958","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gIDM0UdhhmBrzcdXmjHZwb93wkG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/quzB3UTMpjikytRM7EnhsiTpK8f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7BbEgBe7xgvMZjzKGTPSCL0SsXZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
