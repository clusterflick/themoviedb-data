The documentary gives us an intimate glimpse into a world most of us luckily do not have to know. Although often as funny and surprising as a sitcom, it bluntly points to the hardships and desperation of the marginalized. As the pawnbroker states: \"You don't see it in your rarefied living conditions, you don't see how the poor people live, unless you come here. Tragic, some of it.\"","popularity":0.0712,"poster_path":"/bZBPP9zp1FNVWCvbEkqvZMsuZxe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155455,"logo_path":"/66aLE1oKttqtLEk7cJPJnEGBRKW.png","name":"ID: Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broke","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosvita Dransfeld","original_name":"Rosvita Dransfeld","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e2911deec4f3001ca6a893","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1381730","wikidata_id":"Q105820993","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bZBPP9zp1FNVWCvbEkqvZMsuZxe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hKN3cRekPoSYupSMMmUuvBx7vPW.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":657},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eVxaS9X8s1zxQigOFNVKSX7olLK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vancouver International Film Festival","release_date":"2009-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2009-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"TVOntario","release_date":"2010-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
