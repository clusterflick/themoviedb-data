The wunderkammer – also known as cabinets of wonder or cabinet de curiosités in French – emerged among sovereigns and elite collectors in the 16th century. There are extraordinary rooms all over the world: those of the past, the Renaissance cabinets that became, during the course of the 18th century, some of today’s major museums, and those of the present, whose contents come from the most prestigious galleries to be displayed in amazing villas and castles. Eccentric and priceless oddities, private collections, still exist.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/pltMGOHKTwcyHi1w3zFATsJYzQp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magnitudo","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wunderkammer: World of Wonder","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"WOW - World Of Wonder","type":"Titolo provvisorio"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Maria Maggiore","original_name":"Anna Maria Maggiore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Director of MUDEC in Milan","credit_id":"5cb74e0e92514108dbf5e354","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Wynd","original_name":"Viktor Wynd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Collector and Gallery Owner","credit_id":"5cb74e180e0a266b93ef5b30","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918107,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Massimiliano Gatti","original_name":"Massimiliano Gatti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6e0fddc3a3685cbde16098","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1685378,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francesco Invernizzi","original_name":"Francesco Invernizzi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6e0b4d9251412a74056d31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2247080,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chicca Profumo","original_name":"Chicca Profumo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6e9d209251412a7406ca09","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2247081,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tommaso Feraboli","original_name":"Tommaso Feraboli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6e9d6b92514129a20735d7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1836,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/gP0sMJZ2Wyq4BvgIr2ATcI6iTVP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3264}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2660,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/pltMGOHKTwcyHi1w3zFATsJYzQp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1900},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/1WuoNdoJS1ExOALG0huLRsZJyKE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":252077,"name":"wunderkammer"},{"id":252078,"name":"meraviglia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"T","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
