At the Opéra Comique its plot is transported to the time of the works creation with Frances military expeditions to Algeria. It is staged by a first-rate creative team: Stage director Denis Podalydès and costume designer Christian Lacroix provide stunning visuals, whilst conductor Louis Langrée leads the Orchestre des Champs-Élysées, the Chur Les éléments and a stellar cast of soloists in this delightful fools game. Mezzo-soprano Gaëlle Arquez shines with her superlative technique (Le Monde) and Julie Fuchss Adèle performance elicits more than just admiration, namely enthusiasm in the etymological sense of the word: inspired by the divine (Le Monde). A masterpiece! (Télérama), Pure pleasure! (Les Échos). Le Comte Ory at the Opéra Comique is a true musical and theatrical celebration where everything sparkles!
