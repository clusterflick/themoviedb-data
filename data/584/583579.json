Offenbach’s operettas inspired and influenced the works of Johann Strauss, Jr. and Arthur Sullivan. So, even though his works are less familiar in the United States, fans of “Die Fledermaus” or “The Pirates of Penzance” will likely find this amusing work familiar territory.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/4ReYOZHEMjng0T0gqS98EdG5LIT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Grand Duchess - Wichita","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2246370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaitlyn Costello","original_name":"Kaitlyn Costello","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c6d6f970e0a261aafa02adf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2246371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cullen Gandy","original_name":"Cullen Gandy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c6d6fa1925141250a0fed24","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Powers","original_name":"William Powers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c6d6faec3a36843c6eae071","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2140680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alyssa Toepfer","original_name":"Alyssa Toepfer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c6d6fc00e0a261e06a12eb8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Frutiger","original_name":"Brian Frutiger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qaZlrWFSCavlVko6b1KH109FE1V.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c6d6fca0e0a267f9d997563","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2246372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shawna Lucey","original_name":"Shawna Lucey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6d6fdd9251417df40ccc52","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2246373,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edward Lada","original_name":"Edward Lada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6d6fe792514120d503e17d","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4ReYOZHEMjng0T0gqS98EdG5LIT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
