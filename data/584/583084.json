Two of his most popular were a pair of lovestruck kids named Punchy and Judy. Here, down-on-his-luck Punchy obtains a magical straw hat from a plucky talking horse and transforms himself into Aladdin and, with the official permission of DC Comics, Superman. Hoping to impress Judy, Punchy’s delusions of grandeur only land him in jail. The talking horse is a witness at Punchy’s trial and cajoles the judge, arresting Officer Moriarty and members of the jury to test the hat, causing their secret selves to emerge inbound, a hilarious spectacle as their unfettered dreams and desire hold sway.","popularity":0.0623,"poster_path":"/sqsK2rYxAcZrOQcy1UhetNYU7lU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hatful of Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Pal","original_name":"George Pal","popularity":0.1597,"profile_path":"/ptRanXi80Q0o9CJ74zP7pGribk2.jpg","credit_id":"5c6b0a94c3a3685cbdda7d0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Pal","original_name":"George Pal","popularity":0.1597,"profile_path":"/ptRanXi80Q0o9CJ74zP7pGribk2.jpg","credit_id":"5c6b0aaa9251417df407e957","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0036899","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sqsK2rYxAcZrOQcy1UhetNYU7lU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1944-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
