Director Clay Tweel met the Trotters when they were seventeen and filmed them over a period of eight years. By intimately portraying the twins’ hopes and struggles – and the love and help they give and get along the way – the film examines just how much it can take to overcome disadvantages rooted in historic injustice. Connecting us deeply to its heroes, OUT OF OMAHA takes concepts like inequality, racial disparity, and economic opportunity out of the abstract, showing what these large-scale phenomena look like when they are experienced by individual human beings.","popularity":0.0751,"poster_path":"/m5mDmAUby3NWSbenGPeXhmJymDS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of Omaha","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.
