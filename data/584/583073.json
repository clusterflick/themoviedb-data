light.","popularity":0.6574,"poster_path":"/mztR8cp8iWrFRKUEQsi0XvWpHzN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Among
