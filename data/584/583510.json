Many of the films have not been available since their creation, some have never been screened in public, and almost all have been unavailable in copies as good as these until now. Sixty of the world's leading film archive collections cooperated with Anthology Film Archives to bring this long-neglected period of film history back to life for modern audiences.","popularity":0.0461,"poster_path":"/9gvaKx8cPx5MdYOxXEQZORx7w3S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":1140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant Garde Film 1894-1941","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1179,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eV3lgXlqXsU9KQWdGIH2Q1xRTxV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2096}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9gvaKx8cPx5MdYOxXEQZORx7w3S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
