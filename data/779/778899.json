Challenging stereotypes, twelve writer/performers collaborate on four performance sequencesâ€”soak, wash, rinse and extract. Spinning through this tumble- jumble of America's washload, the performers scheme to claim racial images that remain color vivid. Color Schemes was also exhibited in its installation form (with a self-service washing machine) at the Whitney Museum in 1990.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/kmAOvsZbAEc2OAHfmbjcTBLD72u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Color Schemes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shu Lea Cheang","original_name":"Shu Lea Cheang","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":"/wqqhwMxoZR8uxMjaHGXhSwqsOm1.jpg","credit_id":"5fe2bd6672d855003bc07f57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kmAOvsZbAEc2OAHfmbjcTBLD72u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1989-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
