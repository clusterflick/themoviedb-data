Mr. Rupert Howland, a widower of considerable wealth, the father of a girl child, and an old friend of the family, often surreptitiously helped them. He dearly loved the young girl, but it was only at the death-bed of Mrs. Wallace that he really showed it. The poor woman at the point of death realized the helplessness of those she was leaving behind, her own aged parents and her daughter Grace. To assure their future she begged Grace to marry their dear friend, and Grace, touched by the man's goodness and her mother's condition, consented. Not content with the promise, she asked that the marriage take place at once by her bedside, and the wish was granted. Poor Grace struggled hard to love the dear old man, but while she admired and respected him, and was profoundly grateful for his kindness, she could not love him.","popularity":0.3237,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Reef","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Verner Clarges","original_name":"Verner Clarges","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/uQ4vVt4fT8gAjp60AIrdBuYdEZw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rupert Howland","credit_id":"5fdfcbe4764841003d6fd721","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1119397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Egan","original_name":"Gladys Egan","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":"/vOTrPoS99wnuACgIOED2vF6FMXv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elsie - Rupert's Daughter","credit_id":"5fdfcbf2fb3f61003f6974dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Leonard","original_name":"Marion Leonard","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/ftSUgK4P92cPUOMGl3LLeFbdBan.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Grace Wallace","credit_id":"5fdfcc00fd4a96004031bbb7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry B.
