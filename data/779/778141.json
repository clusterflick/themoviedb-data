The film presents their stories. The men play themselves. The analysis distinguishes three types of response to the dilemma: the rationalizer, the drop-out and the organizer. This film is not just about weaponmakers. It is about the dilemma of anyone who finds himself opposed to the system he lives in and works for.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Schizophrenia of Working For War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2558044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonard M.
