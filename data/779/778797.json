As an immigrant to Australia I’d understood what it feels like to be a stranger, and had experienced hurtful comments and prejudice (…‘bloody German’). So I thought, this is funny, these people have been here for donkey’s years, and they to go out in the streets to fight for their own land. I used various mechanisms to let this injustice, this anger out…in particular, zooming through a comb onto the image of the old warrior…letting his emotion stream out through the bars.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":"/nVXDd2yP08T3YfNZhTu5dKmWdyk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1974-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Winkler","original_name":"Paul Winkler","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/l9Z46PsCsfZWoehytV3iji3ccGD.jpg","credit_id":"5fe250edbbe1dd003e496e9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nVXDd2yP08T3YfNZhTu5dKmWdyk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ftghhoeUOlYWcPbLlhxxVEbxfvn.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vXldflTAuMCxAQhZZUuPhmClWt8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Knokke Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"1974-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
