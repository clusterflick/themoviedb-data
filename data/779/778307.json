Philosophers and astronomers like Aristotle and Ptolemy believed that an unknown continent existed in the Southern hemisphere. In the Age of Discovery, renowned explorers like Magellan and Cook searched the Pacific Ocean in vain for a mysterious land they called \"Terra Incognita.\" To this day, ancestral legends throughout Polynesia speak of a lost homeland and a great civilization that disappeared into the sea. Modern science disputes the existence of unknown continents and often dismisses creation myths. But on Rapa Nui, or Easter Island, elders fiercely believe they originate from a continent that sank following a catastrophic upheaval.","popularity":1.0234,"poster_path":"/9IciiQxfi4RNA7vxdeHpD0HMBdd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162650,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wild Life Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Continent of the Pacific","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2123227","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/9C3Oae9U9DDObTfDXUfofzFvzz1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9IciiQxfi4RNA7vxdeHpD0HMBdd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3754,"name":"legend"},{"id":5647,"name":"natural history"},{"id":190531,"name":"speculative"},{"id":284177,"name":"national geographic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
