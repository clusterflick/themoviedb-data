But to the Ngurrara people it is a map, made from memory, of a place where their ancestors lived for over 60,000 years. It is a direct connection to their land - a country where kartiya (non-Aboriginal people) could not live in, because the desert is an impossible environment without knowledge of how to hunt, gather, and find water. The canvas is a strong symbol of solidarity, and of resistance to the colonial project that attempted to decimate the Ngurraraâ€™s connection to their land - now known generically as the Great Sandy Desert.  We Were Lost in Our Country explores questions of personal agency, inherited trauma, and intergenerational transmission, through a conversation among ancestors and descendants. As the voices of the young find their bearings and make their mark on the words of their ancestors, Tuan Andrew Nguyen accesses a past-and-present history of the canvas - a history of displaced memory and of its recreation.","popularity":0.0782,"poster_path":"/qqkriuJQ80l358FYD3t8ooqQZcr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Were Lost in Our Country","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2902820,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Allison Nakamura","original_name":"Allison Nakamura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe03f5d0e44190040eb1b4b","department":"Camera","job":"First Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2902822,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jane Pujols","original_name":"Jane Pujols","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe03f8cfd4a96004032a282","department":"Production","job":"Location Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2902819,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrew Yuyu Truong","original_name":"Andrew Yuyu Truong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe03f3c4a4bfc004078dec1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1923450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tuan Andrew Nguyen","original_name":"Tuan Andrew Nguyen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/p3S56iUcMSF2Qw85BVbapJhpqhN.jpg","credit_id":"5fe03f20e263bb0040bed160","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pwRR8qHWOR7S8fFEgW8GAWnpcXZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qqkriuJQ80l358FYD3t8ooqQZcr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
