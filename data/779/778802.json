Using glitched video footage from classic porn, the broken and distorted imagery speaks to the difficulty that the LBGTQ youth encounter when trying to navigate through their sexuality and relationships. Easy access to pornography means that many young people are learning these important life lessons through a distorted lens. This is especially true of the LGBTQ community where access to information is difficult to acquire from their family, teachers or even friends. The glitched video images mimic the broken messages that much of the porn industry communicates, certainly not the birds and the bee's stories that most youth grow up with.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/tjUeGhrMzA9hsWRy690rUKcFrpp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Relationship","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wrik Mead","original_name":"Wrik Mead","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe2530c4f9a990040a214af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tjUeGhrMzA9hsWRy690rUKcFrpp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sydney Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter Media Art","release_date":"2021-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Material Synthesis @ DiffractiveMedia.Space, White Page Gallery","release_date":"2020-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film Maudit 2.0 Festival","release_date":"2021-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Broken Relationship Trailer","key":"506827069","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-01-31T20:13:27.000Z","id":"61711f7813a3200044e58917"}]}}}
