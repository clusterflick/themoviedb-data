Fleeing  from  the  Communists,  a  few  of  the  younger  generation  managed  to  escape  to  the  West.  The  older generation remained in Latvia, but Stalin’s repression deported many to Siberia as “enemies of the state”. The family is scattered over the world, and the post-war genera-tion have never met. While in America, Peter accidentally discovers the documentary film “Perpetual  Calendar”,  and  instantly  recognizes  his  Latvian  relatives.  Brother  and  sister,  Peter and Helena, follow their parents’ footsteps back to Latgale (Eastern Latvia) to learn more of their legendary ancestor and to finally meet relatives. The family’s search leads to Tomsk, Siberia..","popularity":0.0911,"poster_path":"/hr4wWsTabQRnOVQAi5A9UotYSBz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63198,"logo_path":"/8rUh3lVPfF2mdfJU0a9BoHvvBUW.png","name":"Rija Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2016-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of Fate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2237798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jānis Ozoliņš-Ozols","original_name":"Jānis Ozoliņš-Ozols","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/lEJ5wEA5mKwsIaD0I7ajH373NLo.jpg","credit_id":"5fe283aaeb79c2003c439ee2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2237798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jānis Ozoliņš-Ozols","original_name":"Jānis Ozoliņš-Ozols","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/lEJ5wEA5mKwsIaD0I7ajH373NLo.jpg","credit_id":"5fe283bdeb79c2003e43b7bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598994,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","original_name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lO5h9sKfSwnzQ4V4FdVhBqZr7aF.jpg","credit_id":"5fe283d98a0e9b003f09585b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105430,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Uldis Jancis","original_name":"Uldis Jancis","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe283e70d417e003c4c353b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2905758,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guntra Kuzmina","original_name":"Guntra Kuzmina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe28408f14dad003ccb5488","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557929,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Octavio Iturbe","original_name":"Octavio Iturbe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe28420e640d6003fa64508","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973212,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vilnis Kalnaellis","original_name":"Vilnis Kalnaellis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/dG6F3bVAoodloIE0SR03ec1bKZj.jpg","credit_id":"5fe28434ffd44d0041222b3c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2866213,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jānis Zaneribs","original_name":"Jānis Zaneribs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe28514a0b6b50040119b5d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hr4wWsTabQRnOVQAi5A9UotYSBz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LAND OF FATE","key":"96Il3uo1ed8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2016-09-15T13:18:15.000Z","id":"5fe284bfeb79c2003d43991f"}]}}}
