The narrative is derived from Giambattista Basile's \"Sun, Moon, and Talia\" (1634), which is considered the original version of the \"Sleeping Beauty\" story. Fairy tales, kitsch, and the intricacies of femininity commingle as Feinstein performs as a paper doll, maiden, and crone. The spaces between the dichotomies of fiction and reality, young and old, sexual and pure are disclosed within the scope of feminine identity within this film.","popularity":0.2938,"poster_path":"/budhlUOktZ1jBDrGP6NHOnLmtb5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spring and Winter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2691087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Feinstein","original_name":"Rachel Feinstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef48152c3bffe00346d6a40","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2691087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Feinstein","original_name":"Rachel Feinstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef4815eec370c003624af83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2691112,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexis Rodriguez Duarte","original_name":"Alexis Rodriguez Duarte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef4861eab1bc700359645b1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2564390,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Schuyler Grant","original_name":"Schuyler Grant","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef4863d81a7fc0037be8d8f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tico Torres","original_name":"Tico Torres","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/kwR1wuwDwc48b74eZWycqg0wY3k.jpg","credit_id":"5ef4865aec370c003425abd5","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2691087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Feinstein","original_name":"Rachel Feinstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef4866f81a7fc0035be0662","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j6OKrzYGCpxcPTw2pOGolbD8Ajp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/budhlUOktZ1jBDrGP6NHOnLmtb5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160329,"name":"super 8mm footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gagosian Online - Broadcast: Alternate Meanings in Film and Video","release_date":"2020-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
