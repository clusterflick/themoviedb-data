The owner of the bar, as is his custom, dances with street virtuosity to the rhythm. Sitting near a window, a beautiful woman waits for her lost prince. Four horsemen play Dominoes with mastery, while the melancholic Bartender cleans glasses as if wanting to clean their memories. A wobbly Wise Man (Gaspar), dressed regally, enters the bar and asks for a drink. The bartender offers to serve him a glass of milk instead, which provokes a confrontation between the two, that gradually turns into a duel of words. The Bartender brings out the resentment he has for the Three Kings who never brought him gifts and for the disappointment he has towards life. The Wise Man tries to re-validate himself creating uncertainty of his true identity. Who is this King of the Bar?","popularity":0.0784,"poster_path":"/wJbhhw8eeLXetsSlspi2Hd0qe38.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76080,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Ojo de la Cámara","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"}],"release_date":"2013-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Rey del Bar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1620122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonardo Castro Sitiriche","original_name":"Leonardo Castro Sitiriche","popularity":0.2211,"profile_path":"/9jCxbPPEavfykG2O0ZNIhmkAKLm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bartender","credit_id":"5ef2781c57d37800357c15ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1641876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Ramírez","original_name":"Sonia Ramírez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jugadora de Domino","credit_id":"5ef50340d185720034d15d4d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1620139,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joan Méndez Vidot","original_name":"Joan Méndez Vidot","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef2790043cd5400327a4c0c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicente Juarbe","original_name":"Vicente Juarbe","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/8ahoAF0EYLpkULvgzlH1coyNnYb.jpg","credit_id":"5ef2785f6c84d60035aea6f2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicente Juarbe","original_name":"Vicente Juarbe","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/8ahoAF0EYLpkULvgzlH1coyNnYb.jpg","credit_id":"5ef278553927120037ee3495","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicente Juarbe","original_name":"Vicente Juarbe","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/8ahoAF0EYLpkULvgzlH1coyNnYb.jpg","credit_id":"5ef2783b3faba00035b7c8fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1610416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Idalia Pérez Garay","original_name":"Idalia Pérez Garay","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":"/4b63dDZRJaCY6G4ebyIeT4onEZA.jpg","credit_id":"5ef2786d9a8a8a0036b0dc5a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1620139,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joan Méndez Vidot","original_name":"Joan Méndez Vidot","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef5025181a7fc0037c00ef0","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1641876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Ramírez","original_name":"Sonia Ramírez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef502f781a7fc0036bda926","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12564416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wJbhhw8eeLXetsSlspi2Hd0qe38.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":268036,"name":"wisemen"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"El Rey del Bar 6 12 13 YouTube","key":"-TmlIQMWjDk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2017-03-15T16:11:34.000Z","id":"5ef50431383df20034872ee9"}]}}}
