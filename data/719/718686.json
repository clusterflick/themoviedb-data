And it falls into history, and more precisely, into the field of state interests of the Belarusian state. First, an American spy, and then A.G. Lukashenko himself, begin calling Yura. As a result, “Beaver” nominates a homeless president who has become the next owner of the ill-fated mobile phone, and Yura returns to his “little one,” drinking unbearable domestic beer and watching stupid TV shows.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/1cdZiVbngbonyw1n5BtHBnj3lY1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kid's Case","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Sluchay s patsanom","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Случай с пацаном","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uriy Kanavalchik","original_name":"Uriy Kanavalchik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef3b17c9661fc003525f9c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavel Konovalchik","original_name":"Pavel Konovalchik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef3b184edeb43003140dfbb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Lagutko","original_name":"Anna Lagutko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef3b18dedeb43003140dfd7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikola Melyuk","original_name":"Mikola Melyuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef3b19752dc7f003504e7d4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anastasiya Nekazakova","original_name":"Anastasiya Nekazakova","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef3b1a19cc67b0037bf2de1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitriy Serebryakov","original_name":"Dmitriy Serebryakov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef3b1aa9661fc003325ddeb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uriy Stefanishin","original_name":"Uriy Stefanishin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef3b1b39cc67b0034bd764c","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690346,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lelik Ushkin","original_name":"Lelik Ushkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef3b1f6edeb430032418556","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loban","original_name":"Sergei Loban","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/gEKGmEVnrlKPhatbwC9y7ZYcIeA.jpg","credit_id":"5ef3b1ca9661fc003625e467","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690345,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aleksey Kostyukov","original_name":"Aleksey Kostyukov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef3b1d82b21080034933d20","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikola Melyuk","original_name":"Mikola Melyuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef3b1e7967cc70035490cb9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4657708","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1cdZiVbngbonyw1n5BtHBnj3lY1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
