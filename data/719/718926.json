The score to Circus On is a set of directions for creating an audio performance piece based on a text. First, one is instructed to \"write through\" a book (using mesostic form) to distill a text for recitation (i.e. Cage's Writing for the Second Time through Finnegans Wake). This mesostic text is then used as a guide to make a \"circus of relevant sounds.\" The recited text and \"circus of sounds\" are combined to create a stereo recording (i.e. Cage's Roaratorio).  This project is about translation. It is about the translation of a score for music into a \"score\" for video and film. It is about translating Cage's ideas and aesthetics in the world of sound into the visual realm.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vKrlyxZ9ESYdkbwi9gNXlKLblpC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CAGE: A Filmic Circus On Metaphors On Vision","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933010,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Brose","original_name":"Lawrence Brose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef4d658459ad60036e08ea5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1597,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vKrlyxZ9ESYdkbwi9gNXlKLblpC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1065}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
