This line of thought intertwines with documentation of an experimental gold mining site, now operated by a Canadian company located in the same Portuguese region once studied by Cabral. In Mined Soil, the voiceover dialouge explores the space, surface, and textures of the images presented, proposing past and present definitions of soil as a repository of memory, exploitation, crisis, and treasure.","popularity":0.0724,"poster_path":"/m6rMQJs7EV9iszioP3xamY5gZUT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2014-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mined Soil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1741263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filipa César","original_name":"Filipa César","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/zAEecL0Tk0taY17i50RXSDzJZuk.jpg","credit_id":"5ef3b0a5edeb43003140de99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4391872","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m6rMQJs7EV9iszioP3xamY5gZUT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
