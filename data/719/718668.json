Armed with explosives, they were given the code name fu-go, or fusen bakudan (“fire balloons,” or balloon bombs) in an attempt to instill a culture of fear like that caused by the far more deadly American firebombing of Japanese cities. The U.S. responded by enacting a censorship campaign, requesting newspapers avoid reports of fu-go landings or sightings. Living near the remains of a fu-go launch site in Fukushima Prefecture, Takeuchi mimics their flight take-off using a drone camera, and, traveling to North America, follows their arrival across the shoreline and rural landscapes, using a bat’s echolocation as narrative device to place fu-go and Fukushima as echos across history.","popularity":0.2347,"poster_path":"/8TvC0JSAxHB6Hi0SvhTZs3ywodP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2020-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Bombing, Filmed by a Bat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kota Takeuchi","original_name":"Kota Takeuchi","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef3a6369661fc003425daff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8TvC0JSAxHB6Hi0SvhTZs3ywodP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":5155,"name":"bat"},{"id":10237,"name":"aerial combat"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":33702,"name":"bombing"},{"id":158480,"name":"casualty of war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"Japan Cuts 2020","release_date":"2020-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
