Adapting Shakespeare’s classic comedy of confused identities, bewildered lovers and a startling metamorphosis, Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream comprises the composer’s perhaps most atmospheric score. An entrancing orchestration of instrumental colours breathes life into a magic wood setting the scene for a mysterious dream world.","popularity":0.0948,"poster_path":"/AbYMLnHHucAed93jNq3mTF6wCtM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2689716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hall","original_name":"James Hall","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Oberon","credit_id":"5ef322d4edeb4300323f7d66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2473072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florie Valiquette","original_name":"Florie Valiquette","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tytania","credit_id":"5ef322db2b2108003491403d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Wiegold","original_name":"Richard Wiegold","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Theseus","credit_id":"5ef322e39cc67b0037bce3ae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Polly Leech","original_name":"Polly Leech","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Hippolyta","credit_id":"5ef322eb6beaea0033538835","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Atkins","original_name":"Thomas Atkins","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/bgeW6QSNBPe9R7llOTFqN6RoGHy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lysander","credit_id":"5ef322f4907f26003785a9f7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roxana Constantinescu","original_name":"Roxana Constantinescu","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Hermia","credit_id":"5f5e43a1bdc34c0039f0481a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2168692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Adeline Henry","original_name":"Marie-Adeline Henry","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Helena","credit_id":"5f5e43b0156cc70035d836b0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2183195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominic Philip Barberi","original_name":"Dominic Philip Barberi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Bottom","credit_id":"5f5e43c0d8cc4a0039ef50aa","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Crawley","original_name":"Nicholas Crawley","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Quince","credit_id":"5f5e43cd156cc70036d6f783","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2776321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Bruder","original_name":"Nicholas Bruder","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Puck","credit_id":"5f5e43da2b93200039eb4a9e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Curievici","original_name":"Paul Curievici","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Flute","credit_id":"5f5e43f3688cd0003af798f7","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Grice","original_name":"Daniel Grice","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Snug","credit_id":"5f5e4402fd7aa4003be9a175","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Judson","original_name":"Colin Judson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Snut","credit_id":"5f5e44100b5fd600346c46cb","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Merryweather","original_name":"Nicholas Merryweather","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Starveling","credit_id":"5f5e441dec0c580035b44fa2","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2689718,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tito Muñoz","original_name":"Tito Muñoz","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef3230c907f26003685f785","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Huffman","original_name":"Ted Huffman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef32319edeb4300333f7b6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2669053,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"D.M.
