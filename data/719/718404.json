Despite his popularity, both in Puerto Rico as well as in Latin America, he remains a simple, sincere and lovable person. This 25-minute film explores the life of Andy Montañez through the eyes of his mother Doña Celina. She describes his rise to fame from a mother's perspective, making clear the pride she feels for the oldest of her 18 children. Combined with Doña Celina's narrative, are comments from Danny Rivera, a popular Puerto Rican singer, Nick Quijano, a San Juan graphic artist and Cuco Peña, a renowned music composer. These interviews, intercut with colorful footage of Andy, paint a picture of a grass roots performer, whose humble beginnings helped shape the great artist known as Andy Montañez.","popularity":0.0669,"poster_path":"/5HvgkDGCA6mkr6bq97tASRHNZY6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76080,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Ojo de la Cámara","origin_country":""},{"id":76081,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amatista Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celina's Son","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Montañez","original_name":"Andy Montañez","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ef26c012e2b2c003c71703b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicente Juarbe","original_name":"Vicente Juarbe","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/8ahoAF0EYLpkULvgzlH1coyNnYb.jpg","credit_id":"5ef26b17d11e0e0036b09d60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicente Juarbe","original_name":"Vicente Juarbe","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/8ahoAF0EYLpkULvgzlH1coyNnYb.jpg","credit_id":"5ef26b276c84d60033b024eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1610416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Idalia Pérez Garay","original_name":"Idalia Pérez Garay","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":"/4b63dDZRJaCY6G4ebyIeT4onEZA.jpg","credit_id":"5ef26b3257d37800347bbc7d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicente Juarbe","original_name":"Vicente Juarbe","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/8ahoAF0EYLpkULvgzlH1coyNnYb.jpg","credit_id":"5ef26b4057d37800367b88cc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1639242,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Francisco J.
