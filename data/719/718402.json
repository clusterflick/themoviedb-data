The production fulfilled a fervent wish of principal conductor Marc Albrecht. The music of Gurre-Lieder is timeless, and so is its subject: a passionate, yet forbidden love. The story harks back to a Scandinavian saga, situated in Gurre. King Waldemar loves the girl Tove, who is a mysterious character, connected to both the world of people and the world of birds. The queen is jealous and has Tove killed. The Wood Dove tells of this in a moving song and the king accuses God of cruelty. A nightmarish scene follows, of a fierce army killed in battle, which rampages like a horde of ghosts. The radiant dawn at the end of Gurre-Lieder shows the insignificance of human destiny compared to the power of nature.","popularity":0.2913,"poster_path":"/nOlnG6GKOnIucBshu17hmIz9ya8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113783,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dutch National Opera","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schönberg: Gurre-Lieder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burkhard Fritz","original_name":"Burkhard Fritz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Waldemar","credit_id":"5f11297cea39490035358a48","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2395724,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emily Magee","original_name":"Emily Magee","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tove","credit_id":"5f11299a8566d20037f4e1a4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1437952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Larsson","original_name":"Anna Larsson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/n9dfUFXy8ueImIFwEzRH1WozWlc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Waldtaube","credit_id":"5f1129b643494f00343363ff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1559115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Marquardt","original_name":"Markus Marquardt","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bauer","credit_id":"5f1129d2e004a60038ca1ffc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke","original_name":"Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":"/u6vggu2ugLVNOFcMVuKlNr3XH0N.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Klaus Narr","credit_id":"5f1129ef8566d20037f4e343","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sunnyi Melles","original_name":"Sunnyi Melles","popularity":0.2509,"profile_path":"/ro6nr4EAYKSrXyuKpACUs0BpMgc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5f112a0ac616ac00345ac63c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2205455,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Albrecht","original_name":"Marc Albrecht","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f112a33e004a60038ca20bd","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2714735,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Christof Hetzer","original_name":"Christof Hetzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f112ac543494f00363420cf","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093780,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Jean Kalman","original_name":"Jean Kalman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f112a8643494f003334a48d","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Audi","original_name":"Pierre Audi","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f112a5b43494f0035344cc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1035,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nBjmq3Vq2XREpO6Rlast5tZwBXy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1842},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1035,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nOzZHxcXVGy8Y28A40V2uDQfsuK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1842},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1035,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eDUcHKXV7MVoS2iiPV1ofHZ0nID.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1842},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1035,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fvLxxQdcdCM8ysRe8XPSgLMWqdg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1842},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1035,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5JDebvKlm1Ed7KQu0D06u4OAdtv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1842},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1035,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nwF5rHqzlrZSVbOuvI6gNDlRAS6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1842}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nOlnG6GKOnIucBshu17hmIz9ya8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1052}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
