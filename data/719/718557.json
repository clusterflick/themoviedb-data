They have no money, no connections, no relatives, except for grandmothers who regularly send half of their pension, but they have youth, joy in life, a sense of humor and the hope that they will surely “break through” and they will have everything well. In this situation, you can even live on a scholarship. Everything would be fine if the students didn’t have a seemingly simple task in one day: to get 40 thousand rubles in two weeks to participate in the Roscosmos project competition with their own promising development. It would seem ridiculous money for a city like Moscow. But absolutely not funny for poor students - sophomores.","popularity":0.2753,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":103977,"logo_path":null,"name":"Кинокомпания Сергея Безрукова","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beggars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2644572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Nurulin","original_name":"Денис Нурулин","popularity":0.1363,"profile_path":"/r0Ftu49aABE1MchwjFmY41thXu9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef34e0462fcd30035cf696d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1957845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeniy Kulik","original_name":"Евгений Кулик","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/sfLbKTaZSkltUvQQnu4xVsh4fOd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef34e09967cc70037461929","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Bezrukov","original_name":"Сергей Безруков","popularity":0.635,"profile_path":"/sVl02RViDvXF8aAbEwwqb9Pd8zR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef34e11907f26003785da6a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":223905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Matison","original_name":"Anna Matison","popularity":0.2721,"profile_path":"/f00v7bP3BOlMs0wljs43h2C4vza.jpg","credit_id":"5ef34dd7907f260034858f5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798689,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Timur Ezugbaya","original_name":"Timur Ezugbaya","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef34de29cc67b0036bcc0db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Bezrukov","original_name":"Сергей Безруков","popularity":0.635,"profile_path":"/sVl02RViDvXF8aAbEwwqb9Pd8zR.jpg","credit_id":"5ef34dec2b21080034918452","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Russian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Russian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ru\", \"native_name\"=>\"Russian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
