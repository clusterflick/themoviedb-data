With resistance inside South Africa effectively crushed by the brutal apartheid regime, the fate of the liberation struggle is now in Tambo's hands. He first finds allies in the newly independent countries of Africa, and with their collective strength behind him, he approaches the U.N. for support, insisting that the apartheid government can be forced to the negotiating table if the Security Council will sanction and isolate the regime. But the western powers refuse to act, forcing Tambo to search for new support. He successfully petitions the Soviet Union for help in building a guerilla army, a decision that lands Tambo in the vice of the Cold War and haunts his global efforts for years to come.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/lKTPrKUmcGKl8355Qc1yfZnqlz5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Have You Heard From Johannesburg: Hell Of A Job","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connie Field","original_name":"Connie Field","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/a2lJhidzClwrV6via7TF93UEr1K.jpg","credit_id":"625f1612dfaae9016fcdda16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0965424","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lKTPrKUmcGKl8355Qc1yfZnqlz5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Have You Heard From Johannesburg: Hell Of A Job (Official Trailer)","key":"DESmh6dXdaw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-10-22T21:23:57.000Z","id":"663d429a18e80f9a66d9d13b"}]}}}
