He captured it in an almost obsessive manner from 1978 to 2001. His photographs are a tender chronicle of the daily life of the Scousers, from the market to the Anfield football stadium, through its nightclubs and the seaside resort of New Brighton. In front of Emmanuel Bonn's camera, the photographer revisits these places that continue to nourish his work. Back in his home in Wales, against a backdrop of classical music, Tom Wood invites us to dive into his archives and shares his vision of the medium, his life, and the projects that have marked it. A modest and touching portrait of whom Martin Parr calls the \"unsung genius of British photography.‚Äù","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/679eDLgFXwfDLrmYWX69YZqTEMP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The \"unsung genius of British photography.\"","title":"Five Days With Tom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5057438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Wood","original_name":"Tom Wood","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/klCdlWMez1NfcurK71tn5Fk9UmH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6734e2922fafaec42553f195","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2986806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmanuel Bonn","original_name":"Emmanuel Bonn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734e3692fafaec42553f1fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/679eDLgFXwfDLrmYWX69YZqTEMP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
