Chain dating to get over her breakup turns into finding someone she falls in love with. Love isn't Gwen's strong suit, and she sabotages the relationship as it gets serious. After working on herself and discarding some personal baggage, she makes amends with her would-be love. As a couple, they inspire each other.
