Starting from the home movies of a 1960s Sardinian family, a dialogue made of contrasts: on one hand, Franz Kafka's \"Letter to His Father\", and on the other, images depicting a joyful atmosphere and an ordinary family. Far from the idea of a distant and authoritarian patriarch, what we see is a present and engaged father, playing and posing with his children, bending to fit into the frame.","popularity":0.213,"poster_path":"/xctwedomRr9sql8qomixMGf88OR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145554,"logo_path":null,"name":"Re-framing Home Movies","origin_country":""},{"id":145553,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineteca Sarda","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2024-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A rare way of smiling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Veronica Orr첫","original_name":"Veronica Orr첫","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67348e20c972781b8d73cdbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Veronica Orr첫","original_name":"Veronica Orr첫","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67348e2d9c1a238d8a9d406f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056833,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alessandro Giustiniano","original_name":"Alessandro Giustiniano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67348e3f9c1a238d8a9d407f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2187,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/xctwedomRr9sql8qomixMGf88OR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1458}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"},{"id":221021,"name":"diary film"},{"id":239660,"name":"home movies"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
