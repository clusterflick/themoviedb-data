It is wearing a harness fitted with a camera mount. When the words 'Equipment St Petersburg' are discovered printed on the buckle, speculation breaks out that he has been engaged in some kind of sinister undercover activity.  This documentary explores the mystery of the strange whale and asks where he came from, who trained him and why, and what he was doing in a critically important part of the Arctic, close to Russian waters. With exclusive interviews and access to unseen footage, the film explores the secret world of marine mammal training and international espionage, and sheds new light on the true identity of Hvaldimir, the 'Spy Whale'.","popularity":0.2971,"poster_path":"/vsYOGXBauKwSlkw8ClAZhpOr8oY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32226,"logo_path":"/52pgq5GxpYW5ITOKzmEVplpksQr.png","name":"Oxford Scientific Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secrets of the Spy Whale","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1347578,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caroline Hawkins","original_name":"Caroline Hawkins","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6735330571ef66978cfac9a6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5058009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Shaw","original_name":"Jennifer Shaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6735335e80fda6e3e3742686","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2523453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aurélien Biette","original_name":"Aurélien Biette","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c81fd8f067bcfd6d6e2964","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545471,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandre Soullier","original_name":"Alexandre Soullier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c820150c65ee9abae6fe3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4562875,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lilian Alessandri","original_name":"Lilian Alessandri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c82cf40a00576143c2a09e","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tm8Z4TxMwZBc0YQRNf8fYYLmawU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2175,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vsYOGXBauKwSlkw8ClAZhpOr8oY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1450}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
