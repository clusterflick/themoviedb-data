Meanwhile, experiments in urban coexistence take shape in a tiny but dense jungle in the middle of the city. 'Interferences' is an urban portrait of Berlin at the transition between winter and spring 2024. Revealing the tension between development and spontaneous rewilding, this observational documentary depicts Berlin as a city of ambiguous form, overlapping narratives, and endless material cycles. 'Interferences' implies a disturbance, but also hints at new possible alliances.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yayu3We84phkFMCngySvBKcNi1o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interferences: Tales from Berlin's Third Landscape","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5058947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Pedrini","original_name":"Giovanni Pedrini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6735eaf929197b69875dbdb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2828,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/yayu3We84phkFMCngySvBKcNi1o.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
