It is a role that he came to embrace and ultimately redefine it in his own way. As the role passes on to his son, Prince William not only has to keep up the tradition of duty and hard work that the royal family has always embodied, but also prepare for his destiny to inherit the crown and become King. As the world remains on stand-by to see how Prince William will take on his new title, does he have what it takes to live up to the legacy of a 'Duchy Original'?","popularity":0.6012,"poster_path":"/vmYOCuNuR267yIsgP3oEsiuIcYL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Does
