Expecting a victorious return in a few weeks, the few remaining warriors limp back home after three years of hell. Fearful of what they will find, they experience a very emotional reunion with loved ones, with tears of joy for the living, and cries of sadness for the dead. Their leader, Erik, searches for his bride and finds a shocking surprise.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5057168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"BOHDAN DONALD TANASIJCZUK","original_name":"BOHDAN DONALD TANASIJCZUK","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734c11ac972781b8d73d6a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
