Although David patriotically urges the employees at his factory to enlist, he reluctantly gives in to his mother's pleas to remain at home with her. When David is drafted, his panic-stricken mother alters the date on his birth certificate, although the later birth date implies that he is illegitimate. Disgusted, David enlists under an assumed name, thus shaming Helen, who confesses her dishonesty to the townspeople. Her son, now in uniform, then forgives her.","popularity":0.1703,"poster_path":"/67mFPW6clKnfnqehKQlj0bwX21Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16101,"logo_path":"/2yI4rjPZ1I7TLZ2UWvTtXifYEnw.png","name":"Metro Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A POWERFUL STORY OF MOTHER LOVE AND PATRIOTISM","title":"Her Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1690200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Effie Shannon","original_name":"Effie Shannon","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/ruzI0JAJcLZRZmdxKnmNUSbeCZd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Helen Morrison","credit_id":"6735c3e3143e439db4c6568d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niles Welch","original_name":"Niles Welch","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/tJnAKEZX2bwKtgfnGCFvNLrW0Qg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"David Morrison","credit_id":"6735c3edd4ffba1e8b2ae09d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Curley","original_name":"Pauline Curley","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/1X4DL09JiWm1uQadKORzoHMLczC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Virginia Gordon","credit_id":"6735c3f8dd2c72a8a9037c79","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1239954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat O'Malley","original_name":"Pat O'Malley","popularity":0.1365,"profile_path":"/4evplBNQp1k390ec2Ivrvp4jSF8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Charlie Turner","credit_id":"6735c414dd2c72a8a9037c8d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Riegel","original_name":"Charles Riegel","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/5tmiqq0YOLuCoJAnURYLfyoJloA.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Reverend Mr. Kimberly","credit_id":"6735c43bdd2c72a8a9037c98","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferike Boros","original_name":"Ferike Boros","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/cbk2LpKtfp2CaVz7vMFv0xrK7Mg.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Schultz","credit_id":"6735c4622954d26476257ed4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5058732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James T.
