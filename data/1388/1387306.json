Known as 'Daugaviņa,' this close-knit community of dancers spans multiple generations, each member driven by a shared passion for their cultural heritage.  As they prepare for the journey of a lifetime—to perform at the 150th Latvian Nationwide Song and Dance Festival in Riga, Latvia—they are not just rehearsing steps, but reconnecting with the rhythms of their roots. The festival, one of the largest such events in the world, drawing almost three times more participants than the Olympic Games, represents a homecoming for many, and a chance to immerse themselves in the culture their forebears cherished.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/lpWuQfv4ug4dM6sRubG2jKWuXya.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112129,"logo_path":null,"name":"KULTFILMA","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2025-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"More Than a Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2874118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pauls Dombrovskis","original_name":"Pauls Dombrovskis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734b5031baedda17b97fe94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100884,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Reinis Aristovs","original_name":"Reinis Aristovs","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734b52979280b32169f2213","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506661,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Toms Krauklis","original_name":"Toms Krauklis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734b53c79280b32169f2219","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964948,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ilze Falkovska","original_name":"Ilze Falkovska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734b54c79280b32169f2221","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2874118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pauls Dombrovskis","original_name":"Pauls Dombrovskis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734b55ec972781b8d73d494","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2192057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintars Dreibergs","original_name":"Dzintars Dreibergs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/9hM742w8KgA3vSCitjEfM7wkzSP.jpg","credit_id":"6734b56fc972781b8d73d49d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34465519","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":1462,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lpWuQfv4ug4dM6sRubG2jKWuXya.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":970}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"London Baltic Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Baltic Film Days","release_date":"2024-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"More Than a Dance - trailer with EN subtitles","key":"999514946","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-08-16T13:12:15.000Z","id":"6734b581ac5dde7eb2ddd7d3"}]}}}
