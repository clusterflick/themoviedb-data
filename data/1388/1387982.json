But from the start, fate seems to be working against her. She oversleeps, and has to scramble to get ready. She can’t find a taxi, and has to walk from her hotel to the office. She can’t get into an overly crowded elevator, and has to take the stairs. But despite the setbacks, she manages to make it to the office on time, only to discover that — before she can utter a single syllable — the atmosphere is quite contrary to what one would normally expect. And that atmosphere becomes more bizarre with each passing moment.","popularity":0.0492,"poster_path":"/fJlkiiMFj7yYCqzJz1UrUrICvA3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205638,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tohubohu Productions,
