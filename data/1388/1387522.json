He pursues debutante Katherine Dale, whose fianc√©, Dick Allen, died on the eve of their wedding. With the help of Katherine's ambitious mother, Rodney persuades her to marry him. Katherine dies after giving birth to Rodney, Jr., and the elder Graham's stepbrother, Arthur Haynes, angrily predicts the magnate's sad demise. Rodney devotes himself to raising his son, who later falls in love with Arthur's' daughter, Ruth. Although he objects to the match, Rodney is persuaded by Alice to allow it. Upon discovering that his son was actually Dick Allen's child, Rodney plans to disinherit the boy, but is paralyzed by a stroke before he can change his will. He attends the wedding in a wheelchair and dies soon after.","popularity":0.2429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Playing the role of a modern \"Napoleon\" in his sphere-with all the ambition and scrupulosity, but also the sad disappointment of his famous model.","title":"The Hand Invisible","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Montagu Love","original_name":"Montagu Love","popularity":0.1957,"profile_path":"/aCOahFpYdCKMOg8RO9jMsFOA5xx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rodney Graham","credit_id":"673506f7ce7401f4a4d9c824","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1033183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Hammond","original_name":"Virginia Hammond","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/vUpdaFPmabxykB0zatYPCwezFT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alice Graham","credit_id":"6735070f50e9a3cc6a3d2eeb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Sorrelle","original_name":"William Sorrelle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Arthur Haynes","credit_id":"673507244955eacd19ea20e2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1755435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Gale","original_name":"Marguerite Gale","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/xsgGSEdvGIHmMtkAifVpeWRYF6A.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ruth Haynes","credit_id":"673507412fafaec42553fb67","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Mansfield","original_name":"Martha Mansfield","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/o64uUPmoUqSFkuCTRPxH1XaMNwy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Katherine Dale","credit_id":"673507604c0d01863c76e9bb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Lester","original_name":"Kate Lester","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/l8eowUVHdJd3cs9St9CU8wWB3K3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Dale","credit_id":"6735077350e9a3cc6a3d2f94","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Le Guere","original_name":"George Le Guere","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":"/cIQJp4XstN11qXSpv0pCSODZYgO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dick Allen","credit_id":"673507973ce3a046ac49295b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muriel Ostriche","original_name":"Muriel Ostriche","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/ct7En93rzAtSSntfO9GkQqHYCZ7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Helen Haynes","credit_id":"673507ad0b0a0e646a60943f","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29250,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harry O.
