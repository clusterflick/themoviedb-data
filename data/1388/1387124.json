Under the strict orders of their father, Adam drags his younger brother Ali to witness their grandfather's corpse get washed before burial. Their cousin Iman, their constant playmate, is excluded from the ritual because she is a girl. The sight of the corpse has a profound effect on Adam; he announces that he doesn’t want to grow up and, from that moment on, he stops aging. As the years pass, the villagers come to believe Adam is cursed, while his brother, grappling with his own aging, feels Adam should be institutionalized. Only Iman and Anki, a shepherd and Adam’s lifelong best friend, see his condition as a blessing, preserving in him the pure, innocent goodness of a child. A haunting and beautiful story set against the oases and dust storms of Iraq.","popularity":0.089,"poster_path":"/kPQsHhqYdGDaYvzOBnbZ9z83GO7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SA","name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Once upon a time in Mesoptamia","title":"Songs of Adam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Azzam Ahmed Ali","original_name":"Azzam Ahmed Ali","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6734358aa67e36bb668d8690","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdul Jabbar Hassan","original_name":"Abdul Jabbar Hassan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67343591ac5dde7eb2ddc2b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3316209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alaa Najm","original_name":"Alaa Najm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/flMLq2rVsm1v3udwUJ7Siyz8qLX.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6734359d916a0c1700964ebb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tahseen Dahis","original_name":"Tahseen Dahis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"673435a5ac5dde7eb2ddc2c3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Star Awad Hatem","original_name":"Star Awad Hatem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"673435ae2d237511a019f0d0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hoda Shaheen","original_name":"Hoda Shaheen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"673435b6916a0c1700964ed4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Osama Azzam","original_name":"Osama Azzam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"673435bd1baedda17b97ecc4","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oday Rasheed","original_name":"Oday Rasheed","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/xyDFXoH77PhInczcDEaQACuT1FE.jpg","credit_id":"6734354d916a0c1700964e82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oday Rasheed","original_name":"Oday Rasheed","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/xyDFXoH77PhInczcDEaQACuT1FE.jpg","credit_id":"67343558ac5dde7eb2ddc29b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056435,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Majed Rasheed","original_name":"Majed Rasheed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67343568ac5dde7eb2ddc2a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056436,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ally Tubis","original_name":"Ally Tubis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673435722d237511a019f04e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oday Rasheed","original_name":"Oday Rasheed","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/xyDFXoH77PhInczcDEaQACuT1FE.jpg","credit_id":"6734357da67e36bb668d8685","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":980,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/kVgflWudBSYCQPsg8WP32VRx8mZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1984,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kPQsHhqYdGDaYvzOBnbZ9z83GO7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1417}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Red Sea International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
