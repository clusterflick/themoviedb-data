She is in her 60s and has the looks and conceptions of the typical “middle-aged white woman from the suburbs”. Once strange, seemingly out-of-place characters show up at the beach and start interacting with her, Molly panics. She confronts them, questioning their right to be at the beach with her. What she doesn’t know is that yet another character is going to join and show in the most unexpected way, who really is out of place. This final encounter will change her perspective and ability to reach acceptance in her heart as well as teach her the concept of unconditional tolerance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Introduction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5057128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruna Prosdocimi Arbex","original_name":"Bruna Prosdocimi Arbex","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734bbb5a67e36bb668d9dd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
