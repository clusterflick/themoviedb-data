The style and premise make it a 'street level' story because the characters have no supernatural powers, but still deal with - or create - exceptional real-world problems. Northerner has three principal characters, Shane, Northerner, and Kate. Shane is a thief, who embraces his evolution into a super-villain. Kate has a reputation as a dirty cop and is bound by Shane to her past. Northerner is the catalyst who confronts both Shane and Kate with the opportunity to change the course of their lives.","popularity":0.1738,"poster_path":"/mka33kVWt7diI4ppvIrKP9SH31j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Northerner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3829124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Nurse","original_name":"Justin Nurse","popularity":0.3267,"profile_path":"/wzydPe1MnzsPRe2G7R7B5UHCsci.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Northerner","credit_id":"6733ecad3e82ba79fccf13f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1877614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Marler","original_name":"Brian Marler","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/gy1lTO6juODLWYfV9jCkViHOTYs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Shane","credit_id":"6733ecbc3e82ba79fccf1412","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3260508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megan Jones","original_name":"Megan Jones","popularity":0.0767,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kate","credit_id":"6733ecc4678d3856a76b4d3d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4426535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Cadigan","original_name":"Stephen Cadigan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6733eccd94afc39a2a7027be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4426535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Cadigan","original_name":"Stephen Cadigan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6733ecd1678d3856a76b4d60","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4279123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Cass","original_name":"Andrea Cass","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6733ecdd678d3856a76b4d69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424530,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Duncan De Young","original_name":"Duncan De Young","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6733ece7ac5dde7eb2ddb77b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4283133,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lee Tizzard","original_name":"Lee Tizzard","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6733ecee678d3856a76b4d78","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4276017,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vaida Nairn","original_name":"Vaida Nairn","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6733ecf9ac5dde7eb2ddb789","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4176617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny McLeod","original_name":"Danny McLeod","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6733ed0194afc39a2a7027cb","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34582586","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mka33kVWt7diI4ppvIrKP9SH31j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9715,"name":"superhero"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"FOGFEST","release_date":"2024-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
