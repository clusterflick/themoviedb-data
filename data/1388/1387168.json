In Nightwalker (2022), a film that is an extension of a Polaroid and audio project entitled Solicitation of Crimes Against Nature (2021), I draw attention to how the surveillance eye overlaps with the gaze of a potential predator. The film is ambivalent as to whether or not the character is a sex worker and is more interested in the act of surveillance \"sight-based\" discourse that names individuals as such.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/dMCVFDsI4ZKeaGdlH1IwTbSbpcz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nightwalker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2781172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ayanna Dozier","original_name":"Ayanna Dozier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/q0CyVtlvcxkTyq8CxDNYg0iggpq.jpg","credit_id":"67346590c972781b8d73c633","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dMCVFDsI4ZKeaGdlH1IwTbSbpcz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
