Through vivid symbolism and a unique soundscape, the film explores themes of loss, hope, and the longing for freedom amidst confinement.

adversity.","popularity":0.5672,"poster_path":"/sdB3cCFd6g34obINRmVsUcPqvv5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab
