Saad, a film-maker trying to raise money to finish his movie, has worked for a year with Fethi. He lives in his family’s shed, included as part of a loving household as well as their risky business. At the same time he is obviously an outsider: smartly dressed and prepared to talk back to anyone, including the imam. Tough, gritty but also moodily atmospheric, its tension sustained by a tumultuous soundscape, theis remarkable film delves deeply into the complexities of family, friendship and daily survival.","popularity":0.1012,"poster_path":"/9iZ1pVnu1GGNAHbkCXlYCT8lEhw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bin U Bin, Elsewhere the Border","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salim Kéchiouche","original_name":"Salim Kéchiouche","popularity":0.3885,"profile_path":"/8SG1RTlxHUgiracjs9sMSyLCZ6V.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67343de41baedda17b97f006","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slimane Dazi","original_name":"Slimane Dazi","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":"/tHh9XviWroQWkKOa2jRPh5EkHTW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67343dee1baedda17b97f00b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4906253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanaa Mansour","original_name":"Hanaa Mansour","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67343df657cee02f7d442c6e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Lakhdar Tati","original_name":"Mohamed Lakhdar Tati","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67343d9a12d729010b92453f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Lakhdar Tati","original_name":"Mohamed Lakhdar Tati","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67343da379280b32169f0de9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056489,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-Pierre Morillon","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Morillon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67343db057cee02f7d442c1e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056492,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Youcef Krache","original_name":"Youcef Krache","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67343dbc1baedda17b97efa9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1876139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camille Chandelier","original_name":"Camille Chandelier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67343dc99c1a238d8a9d32ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4001065,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Florent Coulon","original_name":"Florent Coulon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67343dd39c1a238d8a9d32cf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":989,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9iZ1pVnu1GGNAHbkCXlYCT8lEhw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Red Sea International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
