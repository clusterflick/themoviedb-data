Then we are treated to an expos√© of her various moods and selfish acts. For instance, she allows mother to bring breakfast to her in bed, and doesn't even greet her with a smile nor trouble to thank her. And it is nothing for father and mother to sit up until daylight to open the door for her as she returns from a dance. Finally she demands an automobile so that she will not have to bother with taxis, and in order to grant her wish, some of the household furniture has to be sold. In a tantrum she takes her car and goes to her lover, and the closing scene shows her in a home of her own, making life miserable for a husband.","popularity":0.042,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":112283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thomas A.
