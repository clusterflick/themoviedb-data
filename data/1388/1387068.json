This film reveals the connections between multinational chemical companies and the food they want us to eat. Why are these chemical companies buying up all the seed companies in the world? Can hunger and third world farmers' debts be solved by genetically modified seeds? Is this new hope or false promises?  Forty years ago 'seeds of hope' were planted in the Third World, the seeds of the Green Revolution. With the help of improved wheat, corn and rice varieties, enough food could finally be produced to feed the starving masses. Norman Borlaug received a Nobel Peace Prize for the 'miracle seeds' he developed.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":39388,"logo_path":"/gxqUyc2YQw2US7cOpeRrxW7tK1F.png","name":"Bullfrog Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sowing for Need or Sowing for Greed?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3166574,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Judith Bourque","original_name":"Judith Bourque","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6733fff512d729010b923f95","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5056140,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Gunnarson","original_name":"Peter Gunnarson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734000912d729010b923fa5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6958722","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
