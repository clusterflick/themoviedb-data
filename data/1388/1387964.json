The shop’s owner, Leon, is an ardent supporter, and takes Soxer and his entourage on a quick tour. Meanwhile, shop worker Rachael, despondent over her recent breakup with coworker Rick, makes a startling discovery — the candidate is far from what he appears to be, giving new meaning to the term “political machine.” As the group leaves, Rachael tries to convince Rick of what she’s seen, but he misinterprets her warnings. Will Rachael be able to stop Soxer’s ascent to power and redeem herself in Rick’s eyes?","popularity":0.0919,"poster_path":"/cyAFi3DK21hbK1oesoTROsQHcsb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205638,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tohubohu Productions, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rebooting the political machine","title":"Machinations","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andra Whitt","original_name":"Andra Whitt","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/yiJPnU6RTAE8B7eFKWyk5oxNVq0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rachael","credit_id":"6737c64d6a02a24d7b21438b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1522921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Mulkay","original_name":"Ryan Mulkay","popularity":0.1288,"profile_path":"/oULlcgZgkSBy134Vj5K5fgxqyME.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Rick","credit_id":"6737c74ad28043e976e36760","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1770263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nello DeBlasio","original_name":"Nello DeBlasio","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5pM8Ez2hwRuSky3uz2kOBpmV54W.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Leon","credit_id":"6737c6854d477140ce3accb8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Hill","original_name":"Hugh Hill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/hEenmTk9r03QhZduFAUyXUWWa0T.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Soxer","credit_id":"6737c6764d477140ce3accb2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Skelton","original_name":"Emily Skelton","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/2as7yAQQgtxeh75TN35FimUOZ8x.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Vicki","credit_id":"6737c6ab4d477140ce3accd4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Scotten","original_name":"Stuart Scotten","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/7pMKm1GmZ5WJbey0FxWDd8vIwv7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"6737c6b6d28043e976e36737","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Mueller","original_name":"Annie Mueller","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/Ajpc28hLvhZc9mTlwJzRAoGNSoD.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Diane","credit_id":"6737c6dbd28043e976e36748","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katy Borchelt","original_name":"Katy Borchelt","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/hxm7C9M11CxSc6gro1XhDQ8Hrkk.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Reporter","credit_id":"6737c6e9d28043e976e36754","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth J.
