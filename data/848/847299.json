The police then call Gordon in to help solve the crime.  The rest of this short with an ‘all-star cast’ (as the title card announces) includes Jack Fulton, Alice Joy and Peggy Healy. The latter 3 singers, however, do not participate in the plot of the 21 minute short, but provide musical interludes to it.","popularity":0.4195,"poster_path":"/vWq21lQz9qvenSb2lghqXbbgZuW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76630,"logo_path":null,"name":"William Rowland Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Radio Murder Mystery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1631946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Sobol","original_name":"Louis Sobol","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Radio executive","credit_id":"60e08e31bdd5680046144116","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Gordon","original_name":"Richard Gordon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sherlock Holmes of the air","credit_id":"60e08e9cd0b434005ed551ef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Wallington","original_name":"James Wallington","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Announcer","credit_id":"60e08f0b83ee67005ddcb095","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Fulton","original_name":"Jack Fulton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60e09059d0b434007f08d23e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Joy","original_name":"Alice Joy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60e08f8827ff99005df5942d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2601630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Healey","original_name":"Peggy Healey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60e09210fbe36f00465991dd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Sanford","original_name":"Ralph Sanford","popularity":0.7533,"profile_path":"/aHEOl10vc0Qy0xzG5HJ46pSkoQW.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Pat the detective","credit_id":"60e08fda344a8e00287d5b31","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":145700,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Monte Brice","original_name":"Monte Brice","popularity":0.1508,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e0909a344a8e005fc12f74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2351374,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"H.O.
