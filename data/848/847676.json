It was cold and pouring rain, but the demonstrators soldiered on. The Kiss-In was a favorite tactic of ACT UP because it defied the homophobia of the larger society, demonstrated a lack of fear and stigma around AIDS and fostered camaraderie among the demonstrators and within the group as a whole. It was also a whole lot of fun, which is evident from the footage.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/hAzHOaD9i5gUjYnVZYE8q7oWumC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ACT UP Kiss-In (April 29, 1988)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1067797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Hubbard","original_name":"Jim Hubbard","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e23879b3f6f5002c439a21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1183,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hAzHOaD9i5gUjYnVZYE8q7oWumC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":787}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1988-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
