Jocelyne watches the despair of her husband grow along with his obsession with the animal’s body, and his anguish takes root in her own mind. After a night of torment, they decide to go and bury the raccoon on the land where their house once stood in Joutel, a former mining town deserted since 1998. When they get there, the boreal forest is creeping in on the ruins of her former house, plunging Jocelyne into a deep nostalgia. Here, after a morbid picnic marking the raccoon’s burial, the couple meets a mystical being who leads them to make peace with their inner demons.","popularity":0.5775,"poster_path":"/7iikFvoBGv9T3YNylaggiiaG376.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21556,"logo_path":"/5wifS8KxFbogaT9cfrwu8Uz8rbg.png","name":"Unité Centrale","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":140114,"logo_path":"/698xcYut47M1BexvtGKmKX3Yf0a.png","name":"h264","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joutel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Tifo","original_name":"Marie Tifo","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/hRpsrTRNJf80ScZnTdRrw5fCPj3.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jocelyne","credit_id":"60e35aa48805510074df4e23","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Curzi","original_name":"Pierre Curzi","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":"/wVNhAkkVhSwKBaEQR2rNDbZCWcm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gérard","credit_id":"60e35ab127ff99005dfa017a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1804666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter James","original_name":"Peter James","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The Stranger","credit_id":"60e35acc27ff99005dfa0197","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229244,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marie-Pier Dupuis","original_name":"Marie-Pier Dupuis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e35a68258823002d889973","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2124629,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Geneviève Gosselin-G","original_name":"Geneviève Gosselin-G","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e35a75caa508002efedd2e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2235664,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pilou","original_name":"Pilou","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e35a939974ee0026bb1721","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1434835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexa-Jeanne Dubé","original_name":"Alexa-Jeanne Dubé","popularity":0.1479,"profile_path":"/ulMrmpL53NLmMed1R4JYCJ7pcrZ.jpg","credit_id":"60e35a589974ee0026bb1591","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1384927,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Léna Mill-Reuillard","original_name":"Léna Mill-Reuillard","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e35a81b3f6f5002c459a3b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1434835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexa-Jeanne Dubé","original_name":"Alexa-Jeanne Dubé","popularity":0.1479,"profile_path":"/ulMrmpL53NLmMed1R4JYCJ7pcrZ.jpg","credit_id":"60e35a4c26dac10023600034","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286007,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaël Poisson-Lemay","original_name":"Gaël Poisson-Lemay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63259fc0daf57c007cbb0096","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14953350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"joutelfilm","instagram_id":"joutel_lefilm","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3KZCbvxVI3Hqc3cmvlIXoUwgVIX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7iikFvoBGv9T3YNylaggiiaG376.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3737,"name":"dying and death"},{"id":4995,"name":"aging"},{"id":10706,"name":"spirituality"},{"id":162881,"name":"raccoon"},{"id":166701,"name":"ghost town"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
