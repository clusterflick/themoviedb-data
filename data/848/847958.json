Rocko will go to any lengths to buy and sell his way up the social ladder. He thinks he likes the finer things in life, where a sardine sandwich is the height of sophistication. Wash it down with a fine Vintage Cider and he feels invincible. And if you don't want to play ball, well things may go a little out of bounds. Nothing, and I mean nothing and no one, will stand in the way of Rocko becoming Captain of the local Golf Club.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ykJedGQVrrhyH2hzPDCnS1dbR6o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GOLF - Tee Shot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13212798","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":1236,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ykJedGQVrrhyH2hzPDCnS1dbR6o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":888}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
