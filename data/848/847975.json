What possessed the illiterate labourer from the Donegal Gaeltacht to shoot the leader of The Invincibles? Who was the mystery woman posing as his wife? And why did both the US President and the French luminary Victor Hugo plead that Patrick O'Donnell not be hanged for his crime?","popularity":0.2298,"poster_path":"/iERIfnEsBjckVo8qpVR3gK8a0el.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Queen v Patrick O'Donnell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080229,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eoghan Mac Giolla Bhride","original_name":"Eoghan Mac Giolla Bhride","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Patrick O'Donnell","credit_id":"63680166ebb99d00795fc880","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":538385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Jones","original_name":"Stephen Jones","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":"/7OmH9btnIVugIZbbImtaku7qqCO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"James Carey","credit_id":"6368018bc048a90081d89971","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3773525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bridin Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh","original_name":"Bridin Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Susan Gallagher","credit_id":"63680199d8d329007a507a92","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3522563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Campbell","original_name":"Sophie Campbell","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Maggie Carey","credit_id":"636801aa96e30b007a4c85bc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eoin Geoghegan","original_name":"Eoin Geoghegan","popularity":0.1365,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Robert Cubitt","credit_id":"636801b9d207f3007f991d64","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3773526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ciarán Campbell","original_name":"Ciarán Campbell","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Dan O'Donnell","credit_id":"636801cb651fcf008332b048","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1844919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam McGovern","original_name":"Sam McGovern","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":"/t7ESThGTHWYecJ61BrBEBY4qB1V.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dan Curley","credit_id":"636801d8a5046e008124f7ed","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1533772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peadar Cox","original_name":"Peadar Cox","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/4VbVAirjbH9ZdBvGaQUOajteZuI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sir Henry James","credit_id":"636801ebd207f300846c3f4d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1890734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Coury","original_name":"Simon Coury","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/s5gjKchECBbaP25WgZvCUFpOOK2.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"An Breitheamh Denman","credit_id":"636801fb350398007d21bc45","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3773527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Lynskey","original_name":"Tom Lynskey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Charles Russell","credit_id":"63680212651fcf008332b070","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":995518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Bennett","original_name":"Andrew Bennett","popularity":0.1501,"profile_path":"/wf0VuQCjD1RU3OtBt111afthIRo.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"A.M.
