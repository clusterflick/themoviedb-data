Public Discourse is about passionate artists who want their work to be seen by a wide range of people rather than be confined to the systemic structures of galleries and museums. This non-fiction film presents an in-depth study of the use of subversive messages, mimicking of advertising methods and the presentation of three-dimensional sculptures to the public.","popularity":0.1962,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Public Discourse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1927948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Harvey","original_name":"Ellen Harvey","popularity":0.1112,"profile_path":"/zLc7x3rmXwZzQW2CNU61ToqT9lG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"60e2653f880551002d07af03","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3146173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darius Jones","original_name":"Darius Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"60e2656f4ca67600461f5127","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shepard Fairey","original_name":"Shepard Fairey","popularity":0.2946,"profile_path":"/6SFXfEe3mA5O1tJacgQ21WBVzbK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"60e2658d1056110047f45f8e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caledonia Curry","original_name":"Caledonia Curry","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self (as Swoon)","credit_id":"60e2660383ee670027c02941","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3146175,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tim Hansberry","original_name":"Tim Hansberry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e266748805510074ddd8e7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3146174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brad Downey","original_name":"Brad Downey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e26631a4af8f00466d758e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629784,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Quenell Jones","original_name":"Quenell Jones","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63beda0321118f0089e519e8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3295826","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
