The Easter Bunnies are very busy. But things don't turn how the way they should, the most beautiful and colorful Easter eggs have disappeared. Harry, the Easter Bunny detective, faces a difficult task. And there's Nikki, the Easter bunny girl, who suddenly starts to feel weird at the Easter Egg hiding place. No wonder, because she is immediately pulled out of the cylinder of a magician who is just giving a children's performance.  And because even Easter Bunny children like to tell stories, they imagine what would happen if the Easter Bunny was not an Easter Bunny but an Easter Elephant or an Easter Giraffe. You're bound to think of even more.","popularity":0.4223,"poster_path":"/AfoTW07UUJ0e8zk1t33EJkZoIj8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dingo
