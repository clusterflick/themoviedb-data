All three of them started making their living early in their youth as sex workers in Athens, Greece. In “The Oleanders” Betty Vakalidou, Eva Koumarianou & Paola Revenioti revisit all the different places in the city where they used to work, socialize, get harassed or arrested by the cops, fight for their rights, have fun and find love. The unapologetic, humorous, and empowering discussion between Eva, Betty & Paola is a history of Athens as well as a history of sexuality in this region.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/8GRUNdfCi5D4CsPZtS5aejv8GjX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Oleanders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1092440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Vakalidou","original_name":"Μπέττυ Βακαλίδου","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/m4toRPQtFy1wqxSljOEi2aZFeDD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"(Herself)","credit_id":"60dfa1799979d2005d421933","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2419887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Koumarianou","original_name":"Eva Koumarianou","popularity":1.38,"profile_path":"/fAdOUSi5uJNmtBcihSdF3RJDGu0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"(Herself)","credit_id":"60dfa180b686b90046e736df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1441588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paola Revenioti","original_name":"Πάολα Ρεβενιώτη","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/ly6IgW8uewWcjHScQDkmITpivYb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"(Herself)","credit_id":"60dfa189b686b90075f7bf89","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1441588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paola Revenioti","original_name":"Πάολα Ρεβενιώτη","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/ly6IgW8uewWcjHScQDkmITpivYb.jpg","credit_id":"60dfa199945d360046f95ec4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1441588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paola Revenioti","original_name":"Πάολα Ρεβενιώτη","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/ly6IgW8uewWcjHScQDkmITpivYb.jpg","credit_id":"60dfa19fb686b90075f7bffa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2862503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elpiniki Voutsa-Rentzepopoulou","original_name":"Elpiniki Voutsa-Rentzepopoulou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dfa1ac4544af002d372b69","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2862506,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Vangelis Tsakas","original_name":"Vangelis Tsakas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dfa1b6b686b9005e4628a6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144178,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Giorgos Gonos","original_name":"Giorgos Gonos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dfa1bf1e9225002cc184c6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144179,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christina Lagouri","original_name":"Christina Lagouri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dfa1c84544af0074f9c371","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144180,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexandros Sinodinos","original_name":"Alexandros Sinodinos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dfa1d20f3655002f6d6498","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144180,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexandros Sinodinos","original_name":"Alexandros Sinodinos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dfa1eafbe36f007404359b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14972740","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ezEHEcybv4Nw5FaQZenTsdB4fjv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1017,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8GRUNdfCi5D4CsPZtS5aejv8GjX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":686},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1TnnEikisg0jCwQsNAJilyYrFgw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki Documentary Festival","release_date":"2021-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"K18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"#TDF23 | The Oleanders [FILM FORWARD]","key":"sVdWqMLPNCo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-06-04T12:23:12.000Z","id":"60dfa2754ca67600461a0cf4"}]}}}
