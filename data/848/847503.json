The motivation of the travelers is different. It is mostly their personal experiences, stories and reports that shape the public image of volunteer services in Africa. But what do the guides on site think about the coming and going of the German guests? What visible and invisible traces do volunteers leave behind in the projects from the perspective of people living on site? In the perspective-rich documentation, people in South Africa, Ghana and Gambia describe their perspectives and experiences with German volunteers. An exciting film about the diversity and complexity of encounters in context of voluntary service.","popularity":0.0736,"poster_path":"/q4I9GUNM5bTQrucy9guC9wpaQI4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"a change of perspective on german volunteers in africa","title":"Blickwechsel - Perspectives on German volunteers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1594669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Weinert","original_name":"Christian Weinert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e1a0ab071650004616a80c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1594669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Weinert","original_name":"Christian Weinert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e1a0b3a3b5e6002911b287","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2458608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ferdinand Carrière","original_name":"Ferdinand Carrière","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e1a0bf8805510074dc285f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":815,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q4I9GUNM5bTQrucy9guC9wpaQI4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":551}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Vimeo","release_date":"2018-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
