Recognizing the opportunity for a great story, Fritzi's press agent encourages her to accept the Westerner's proposal of marriage, only to deny it the next day in a wave of newspaper publicity. Disheartened, Keyes returns to Arizona and Fritzi continues performing until she suffers a nervous breakdown. Reading of Fritzi's misfortune, Keyes returns East, kidnaps Fritzi and takes her to Arizona. There, the change of climate performs wonders and she recovers quickly. Meanwhile, her stage manager sends detectives after her, and when they arrive in Arizona ready to arrest Keyes for kidnapping, Fritzi explains that the whole adventure was an elaborate publicity stunt and announces that she and her Arizona cowboy are going to be married.","popularity":0.3824,"poster_path":"/rKEUdewZUJNmRCt3DVHx5itAuXM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broadway Arizona","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olive Thomas","original_name":"Olive Thomas","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/coDCGDmaICZjiBK8nReFerZ8Oja.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Fritzi Carlyle","credit_id":"60e33ead27ff990074dc39d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Chesebro","original_name":"George Chesebro","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/s8A5WerpnAjIom4ezjiTEcDEOc4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"John Keys","credit_id":"60e33ece1e9225002cc7dd90","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":951261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Hernandez","original_name":"George Hernandez","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":"/qDb0rmbrShNUnopaFIx18hwugFL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Uncle Isaac Horn","credit_id":"60e33eec27ff99005df9cfc9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Curtis","original_name":"Jack Curtis","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":"/huntTbXIEl8GPyFkM3FJ6LB96wY.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Jack Boggs","credit_id":"62c937eadf29450068f4cc93","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1551623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dana Ong","original_name":"Dana Ong","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Press Agent","credit_id":"60e33f58db154f0074c83919","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Guise","original_name":"Tom Guise","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/bXTQvjO4qKwiWlvobaBb3klmqdi.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Old Producer","credit_id":"60e33f75b76cbb004614fa20","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1785102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neola May","original_name":"Neola May","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/mf5VlMydpD3GtjTJKTT5nGSFPyx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Indian Squaw","credit_id":"60e33f94880551002d08dd33","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1072362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynn Reynolds","original_name":"Lynn Reynolds","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e3478dcaa50800801c3d67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clyde Cook","original_name":"Clyde Cook","popularity":0.1297,"profile_path":"/NpLs5A31LY7CCIO6KWGeEltDoE.jpg","credit_id":"60e347a583ee67005de1cbed","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":796,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rKEUdewZUJNmRCt3DVHx5itAuXM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":556}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1917-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BROADWAY ARIZONA 1917 - Olive Thomas - Extremely Rare Film","key":"8W4w28dDXOU","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-08-19T19:35:36.000Z","id":"60e465ed27ff99005dfb7491"}]}}}
