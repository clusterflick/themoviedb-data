This film is an introduction to the culture, music and zest for life of the Cape Verdean people. On the occasion of the famous carnival of Mindelno, on the island of São Vicente where Cesaria Évora was born, this documentary offers a musical journey to discover \"Sodade\" and its legacy. Cesaria Évora, who died in 2011 after a twenty-year career, has allowed Cape Verde to shine throughout the world. The \"barefoot diva\", considered the queen of the morna has conquered the world and inspired many Cape Verdean artists. The small archipelago, which was for several centuries an important hub of the slave trade has promoted since then an important ethnic mix, which has played an important role in the evolution of local music.","popularity":0.5909,"poster_path":"/oXpO2pKiBjl6G3F3m1uD2sQr0ic.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vincent
