Her attractiveness, so different from that of the fisher maidens, has a telling effect on the young man. He asks her, at length, to become his bride, and she accepts. But a few days before the wedding the affianced bride disappears, sailing away with a strange man from the city, who has suddenly appeared. Thinking that his sweetheart had deserted him for another, the fisherman is heartbroken for a time, but gradually the keen edge of his sorrow wears away, and he succumbs to the attractions of another girl, one who had recently come to the village with her father, and who had lived together and alone at the end of the town.","popularity":0.1304,"poster_path":"/p9mxOMCp8rFLRyaFrOSg0NGdcFy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Net","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1601285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Delaney","original_name":"Bert Delaney","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The Fisherman","credit_id":"60e0b7e4105611002a528970","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Swayne","original_name":"Marian Swayne","popularity":0.1512,"profile_path":"/mL3K4B1gNFTpBCldmFdKJXxvwK7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Fisherman's Sweetheart","credit_id":"60e0b7fa4ca676005e0f28c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1591390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inda Palmer","original_name":"Inda Palmer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/tAJSRG0fnpxo3TGGPciwkujO1Ti.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Fisherman's Mother","credit_id":"60e0b80efbe36f0074061715","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1448274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Jewett","original_name":"Ethel Jewett","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/jVHsCY7fiZ6ICiRdbPKRra0I0nC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Mysterious Girl","credit_id":"60e0b82d27ff99002acb2aba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Bauer","original_name":"Arthur Bauer","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mysterious Girl's Former Employer","credit_id":"6684d0191d632825ae75eca0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1860196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Jones","original_name":"Morgan Jones","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/p6i6dkjmeOgopaT31qgr5kJurZS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Detective","credit_id":"6684d04649f54f075d1f61d8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1003481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William P.
