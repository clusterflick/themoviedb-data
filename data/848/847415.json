Generalization is also known as carry-over. It is the ability to apply something learned in a specific situation to other situations. Children generalize language when they play with a toy train, see a real train, and then realize that the word train represents both objects. Another example of generalization is when children say more blocks and then later ask for more milk.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rvjv25G1Xpi6cmyik9UImFuD9T6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baby Babble - Real World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rvjv25G1Xpi6cmyik9UImFuD9T6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
