En route from the barbershop to seeing his date, he realises that his concerns were, in fact, very much with merit; for in Israel, a moustache is the symbol of the enemy. An endearing little comedy with an absolutely addictive soundtrack, which offers a tongue-in-cheek look at the various facets and manifestations of Israeli racism.","popularity":0.0589,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moustache","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1209363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yakov Cohen","original_name":"Yakov Cohen","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":"/pRLy37DeCO61MdO0rjUO7HBMMGP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60dff9b00f365500755156f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156702,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Renen Schorr","original_name":"Renen Schorr","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60dff9de344a8e005fc09dd5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Idit Tepperson","original_name":"Idit Tepperson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60dffa08bdd568007ea2ed01","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaschar Vishnia","original_name":"Isaschar Vishnia","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dff9064ca6760075ff271f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaschar Vishnia","original_name":"Isaschar Vishnia","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dff93dfbe36f002d522dae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
