Unveiling the secret of ancient shaman-healers, he teaches us that many of our physical and psychological problems stem from imprints within our luminous body. Dr. Villoldo reveals the nature of this luminous field, how it acts as a blueprint for our physical body and how by understanding its nature, we can actually heal ourselves and each other. Once the luminous body is cleared, Dr. Villoldo explains, physical and emotional healing can begin. Many of our illnesses, psychological disorders, addictions and failed relationships can be traced to faulty imprints in our luminous body. In this video, Dr. Villoldo unveils how to heal and recover from these destructive imprints and regain our physical, mental and spiritual well-being.","popularity":0.0639,"poster_path":"/tUpUf9CG5w43sKvn9fdJ74TOkJg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sacred Mysteries","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Healing the Luminous Body: The Way of the Shaman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Villoldo","original_name":"Alberto Villoldo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60dfc1b50f3655002f6dbef9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":560332,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jay Weidner","original_name":"Jay Weidner","popularity":0.3917,"profile_path":"/ou8Wyry5vzKnfntL4c5x3VlSEA3.jpg","credit_id":"60dfc1ded0b43400477d41ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1997376","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tUpUf9CG5w43sKvn9fdJ74TOkJg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
