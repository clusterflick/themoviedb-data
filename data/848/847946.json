When Madge is expelled from boarding school for her practical jokes and pranks, she joins her mother and sister in Palm Beach, where they are wintering, in hopes of snaring a titled husband for Julia. Julia, fearful that her little sister will impair her success on the marriage market, forces Madge to dress as a child of ten. Julia has her sights set on the Earl of Larsdale, but after a series of misadventures, Madge elopes with the young man who turns out not to be an earl at all, but a prosperous young American who is holding her father's notes. Thus, she saves the day for the Flower family.","popularity":0.2601,"poster_path":"/ohLb2jKAi0CL87JCVxFbAWUYNc6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50574,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York Motion Picture","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madcap Madge","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Frøken Bilrøver","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Madge l'écervelée","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Den galenpannan Rut","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olive Thomas","original_name":"Olive Thomas","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/coDCGDmaICZjiBK8nReFerZ8Oja.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Madge Flower","credit_id":"60e339fc071650005da173cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Gunn","original_name":"Charles Gunn","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":"/4eQXdUj3Qz7weEbevE5NbmQgxIe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Denham","credit_id":"60e33a2a4ca676002de15d6c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1567605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorcas Matthews","original_name":"Dorcas Matthews","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Julia Flower","credit_id":"60e33a5183ee67005de1af95","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aggie Herring","original_name":"Aggie Herring","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":"/lCtg32IebFcvL5mKseOz2himYxt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Flower","credit_id":"60e33a681e9225007ed636df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Livingston","original_name":"Jack Livingston","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":"/y7Gs83nnlnPo7kvf6R16nYsMcmM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Charles Lunkin","credit_id":"60e33a8da3b5e6005d8cade2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
