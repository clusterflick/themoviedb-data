Max is excited. Because he has wished for something very special – but only quietly – he did not dare to wish aloud.  At last, it is time for the presents. Max is overjoyed. How did his parents know what he had wished for? And the present is even better than he imagined. The craziest adventures can be experienced with it. And what he does experience, how he makes Kimba the lion his friend, or why he gets splashed soaking wet by Dicki the elephant, you can witness in the animated story of “Max and his wonderous present”. Do you already know what kind of present it is?","popularity":0.3473,"poster_path":"/8Kb5eJVnpJ6rkimEj4nhwKcHYQh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134538,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Concept","origin_country":""},{"id":47629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dingo Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merry Christmas: Max's Miraculous Gift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Weihnachtsmann erzählt","type":"DVD Release"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Frohe Weihnachten","type":"VHS Release"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Weihnachtsüberraschung","type":"DVD Release"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Max's Miraculous Gift","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3125370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Seiffe","original_name":"Viola Seiffe","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"60e0d19fb686b90046e95ac5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144995,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Renate König","original_name":"Renate König","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e0d17d072166002cd45ebe","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1378665,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ludwig Ickert","original_name":"Ludwig Ickert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e0d18a0f3655005e0abb83","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1298898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roswitha Haas","original_name":"Roswitha Haas","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e0d16a10561100761a4efd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144994,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Krysztof Kubica","original_name":"Krysztof Kubica","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e0d159072166002cd45e30","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144999,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Klaus Müller","original_name":"Klaus Müller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e0d1c083ee670046f0d4cd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1298898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roswitha Haas","original_name":"Roswitha Haas","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e24307b76cbb0073de6c9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xErcwSYpdvDnlSJ6M77zmkneCUV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wxTbw7Rq4ZCNZS44LdM8D7Ky3Ms.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/IDgOZzFUlekhDV9hVWvCXnUEvT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ilvfvu0Zytmu30NZZbDRKGoYJgn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yRBUDSmLe9FedH5YFH7JIfgAXVb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/8Kb5eJVnpJ6rkimEj4nhwKcHYQh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/x3QjfEXEf6ATZFAptBiNdehg7z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/qSCP9UIwLJY8uQr96YOcGNvfAyF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10565,"name":"model airplane"},{"id":197349,"name":"children's story"},{"id":224389,"name":"imaginary world"},{"id":234662,"name":"hand drawn animation"},{"id":238405,"name":"exotic animals"},{"id":260365,"name":"christmas eve"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VHS","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD Reissue","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
