Drawing on archival footage from those gatherings, including interviews and readings, Fear of Poetry presents a snapshot of Venice in the 1980s: a chorus of punks, poets, artists, and performers co-existing in a place where, according to Flanagan, “love is still possible.”","popularity":0.0585,"poster_path":"/wWMm2Xkfwvu3d50a3TlwnfWT15s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fear
