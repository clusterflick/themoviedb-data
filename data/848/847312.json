No matter how hard they try, their bodies, minds, and voices won't do what they're told. People with Tourette Syndrome (TS) , a rare and incurable genetic disorder, are the subject of the irreverently titled Twitch and Shout, a riveting, unsettling, and frequently funny inside look at what it's like to live with this often misunderstood neurological condition. Twitch and Shout not only sheds light on the nature of this puzzling disorder, it also examines the way society all too often heaps scorn and abuse on those who stray, however involuntarily, outside the limits of conventional behavior.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":"/bpAXcXeGGglDWXVvX6fgakzggb6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twitch and Shout","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lowell Handler","original_name":"Lowell Handler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"60e09b9d071650007e43100a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Handler","original_name":"Evan Handler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60e09e349979d2005d43b644","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1724145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurel Chiten","original_name":"Laurel Chiten","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/yjF3M8UdSlbZR7uDTiuNwtBgiSG.jpg","credit_id":"60e09b6db686b90075f95fc4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0108414","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bpAXcXeGGglDWXVvX6fgakzggb6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Twitch and Shout trailer","key":"cOhcZBuN7iw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-10-26T20:11:13.000Z","id":"60e09a7727ff99002acae7a8"}]}}}
