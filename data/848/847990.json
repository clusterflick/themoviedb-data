The film dives into the conservation of her legacy in Moscow archives, what has been told and untold, and her vision of the future of a socialist feminist revolution. Love with Obstacles is the first part of the feature film Amor Rojo (to be completed in 2021) which will draw a fuller portrait of a figure that is able to bridge a century of feminisms, from first wave to fourth and fifth, across a couple of oceans, from Russia to Mexico and the Pacific. Through her legacy and its place in the history of ideas, the film seeks to draw a genealogy to today’s renewed surge of feminism.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/kEyVw4UUd7smkFzNxvZ9oV7qbae.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2020-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love with Obstacles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dora García","original_name":"Dora García","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e35c5783ee670046f53d7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15041744","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kEyVw4UUd7smkFzNxvZ9oV7qbae.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
