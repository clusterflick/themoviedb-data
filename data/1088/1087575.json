Soon after arriving in her new home, Cameron started hearing strange, ghostly voices at night coming from the basement's locked door. Little Cameron would soon discover what was actually behind that door, people chained to the wall, innocent victims of her Aunt's schemes to enrich herself by cashing their benefit checks. It wasn't long before Cameron was demoted down into the basement herself, where she would stay for the next ten years while police thought she was missing.","popularity":0.8639,"poster_path":"/3XAWKjWHzXmOGyLYUIUrLdi1HAV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6728,"logo_path":"/2HMc1LNp5BoVSJtM2vHh5UuLXfw.png","name":"Swirl Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girl in the Closet","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":203302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tami Roman","original_name":"Tami Roman","popularity":0.5863,"profile_path":"/7tXyUvpVIUvQMr0C64U18WhWepg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mia","credit_id":"63ee42a1699fb70084e29443","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1757704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stevie Baggs Jr.","original_name":"Stevie Baggs Jr.","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/50PKQFk8oVyHOUZnJ4iatBdpFIv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Chris","credit_id":"63ee42b6813cb60084b3beed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1562348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Remy Ma","original_name":"Remy Ma","popularity":0.1977,"profile_path":"/r6tCzOgVNUAxKmrXOk8qGjfGI2i.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Patricia","credit_id":"63ee42c3699fb700cee28846","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3770048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daijah Peters","original_name":"Daijah Peters","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Teen Cameron","credit_id":"63ee42d3813cb600dc083867","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2648236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle LaRoach","original_name":"Danielle LaRoach","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/zt6eMNEuRL7RrGXe8XV1pdxlrEV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Nancy","credit_id":"63ee42e01f3e600089dfdf2f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2748148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willie Raysor","original_name":"Willie Raysor","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Pastor","credit_id":"63ee42f5813cb600c66d77d4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Dunston","original_name":"David Dunston","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/Alfx7oT09pReA0oIAe5xqkFqaXB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Street Goon","credit_id":"63ee430b1f3e60007fb6f5b6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3618710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teisha Speight","original_name":"Teisha Speight","popularity":0.1003,"profile_path":"/odz1BIzA7paQN7qhIOcITpfA6wd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Joanne","credit_id":"63ee43188e870200dc7da2cd","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3923469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaira Thomas","original_name":"Jaira Thomas","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ee421e1b729400866e4ae5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2970893,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sa'Rah L.
