When the party finds a desirable location, the girls begin to gather shellfish while the men ply their trade. When the fishermen attempt to return, their boat is wrecked in the surf and they are caught in the rocks. As evening comes on the girls leave for the camp and are startled by hearing a gunshot. They investigate and find that a hunter, bitten by a rattlesnake, has fired to attract attention. The girls assist the hunter to dress his wound and as they depart they sight the fishermen imprisoned on the rocks. With the assistance of their newfound friend they succeed in rescuing their relatives.","popularity":0.074,"poster_path":"/yRKVqeDYv4NDPev0iHOvodhCk9O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalem Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Peril of Their Lives","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Coxen","original_name":"Edward Coxen","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/msS2eq5NpafWYO4W78SQIiVYS7s.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Trapper","credit_id":"63ee8501d04d1a007be1449f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Roland","original_name":"Ruth Roland","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/jANjK6xntsIsuAeG2UE44kc7W6k.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Fisherman's First Daughter","credit_id":"63ee85087cffda007cba0018","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marin Sais","original_name":"Marin Sais","popularity":0.1624,"profile_path":"/3AFsydIl9Vu2UhPZsPCETWLoh0l.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Fisherman's Second Daughter","credit_id":"63ee850e6aa8e000cec617f6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John E.
