Since Jaya is or marriageable age, he has arranged her marriage with hard-of-hearing Shiv, the son of Dayashankar, who is the President of the Gram Panchayat. Dayashankar is anxious to get Shiv married so that he can get some dowry from Gokul. The other suitor for Jaya is Ratan, whose mother would like her to re-marry her son as his wife, Maya, is unable to conceive. Then a new doctor arrives in this village to look after the charitable dispensary. Things heat up when Dayashankar and Ratan's mom find out that he may be Jaya's new suitor. Hilarious chaos reigns when Maya assaults her cruel mother-in-law, and Ratan abducts Jaya from her marriage with Shiv.","popularity":0.208,"poster_path":"/2VltU83ueL5qkAtQk0dn9SNcLma.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1957-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ek Gaon Ki Kahani","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2044608,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Talat Mahmood","original_name":"Talat Mahmood","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/zA1NrvJblbKQWRIDdcrTTBPeCzz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63ee389d1b7294007c4ada14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mala Sinha","original_name":"Mala Sinha","popularity":0.2398,"profile_path":"/aFMZlh1BCSuVIRUw1TgavpHPL4k.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63ee38c18e870200864229eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"I.S.
