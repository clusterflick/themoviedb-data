The docufiction exposes ancient sardinian “power places” from hystorical, cultural, archeological and energetical points of view crossing over magical and folkloristic local traditions.  It’s a totally digital work, advanced videophotographic techniques for an analogical, unsequential, visionary drive. Mental feedbacks and forseeings, a stream of consciousness. The rich soundtrack, leads often the experience, overwriting the script. Pedra Mendalza is a digital tale with music.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/2mhKxAO3jvEPeBppqj9AtQs3zlw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"a digital tale with music","title":"Pedra Mendalza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3924487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudio Rocchi","original_name":"Claudio Rocchi","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/prNkxHDjgh7lvoFniZVrKD1Y8dH.jpg","credit_id":"63eee09dea84c700b29cbbc3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2mhKxAO3jvEPeBppqj9AtQs3zlw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
