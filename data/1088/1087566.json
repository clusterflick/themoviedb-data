Set in the months following the Brussels bombings of March 2016, and just before the “Brexit” referendum, Chang’s film captures the city of Brussels at a vulnerable moment. Functioning as a portrait of the city, the film shows Brussels’ European institutions, WIELS, lush parks, as well as the various communities that intersect in Chang’s life: her fellow artists, her queer friendship group, and her Roma and Syrian refugee neighbours. Brussels appears as a series of parallel realities, brought together by Chang’s gaze.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/mAOkfFyk0oT2l5vD6Nb5ay6kExj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2016-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brussels, 2016","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3923448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Sejin Chang (Sara van der Hei","original_name":"Sara Sejin Chang (Sara van der Hei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ee40321f3e6000a1c68e8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mAOkfFyk0oT2l5vD6Nb5ay6kExj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"Beursschouwburg Brussels","release_date":"2016-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
