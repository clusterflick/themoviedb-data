The film delves into Emily's profound realisation that her relentless pursuit of perfect waves has shackled her to an unending cycle of dissatisfaction. She finds herself stuck in a cycle of wishing for better waves, a better board, or better performance. Throughout the expedition, she confronts her \"grass is always greener\" mindset head-on, discovering that her fixation on better waves, equipment, and performance has robbed her of the ability to truly savour the present moment.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A surfers journey along the north coast of Scotland.","title":"White Horses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34227128","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
