Harking back to a childhood overflowing with adventure and fantasy, he recounts anecdotes of quasi-sci-fi scenarios featuring the notorious pirate Cheung Po-tsai with whom his grandpa claimed lineage and Mazu, Goddess of the Sea, vanquishing a giant sea monster amid tensions between navy troops of both sides of the Straits! Those were the fishing days of counting on divine providence to weather the harsh elements of nature. Now heading north for one final destination on the eve of resuming his sea-faring days, Fi follows the clues on the treasure map bequeathed by his grandpa on a hunt for a treasure irrevocably lost but not forgotten.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land Sickness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
