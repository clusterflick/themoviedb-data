It is one of the rarest and most mysterious big cats in the world.  \"Ghost of The Mountain\" follows the journey of a wildlife photographer searching for this secretive predator. But he is not alone. Along the way, he meets the people who live in these harsh lands— herders, trackers, and conservationists— who work every day to protect the snow leopard and find ways to live alongside it.  Through their stories, we explore the delicate balance between survival and coexistence, between ancient traditions and modern conservation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost of The Mountain: The Story of The Elusive Snow Leopard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rigzin Nubu","original_name":"Rigzin Nubu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69606b1e8915431aa31d7d7c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsewang Namgyal","original_name":"Tsewang Namgyal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"69606b2eff2cbc72321d7d40","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanba","original_name":"Stanba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"69606b3aecc6f8afbbbd2d54","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanzin Laksoo","original_name":"Stanzin Laksoo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"69606b48194878504c1d7e3f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Padma Gyalpo","original_name":"Padma Gyalpo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"69606b53a2c20d3a48f3fd41","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nawang Dolma","original_name":"Nawang Dolma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"69606b5e1a6565245d59599f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Padma Dolma","original_name":"Padma Dolma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"69606b69e95d30735f363dfc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsering Dolkar","original_name":"Tsering Dolkar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"69606b7b8915431aa31d7d86","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abhishek Sachidanandan","original_name":"Abhishek Sachidanandan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69606bbbc78aae806fd1418c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanzin Nordan","original_name":"Stanzin Nordan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69606bee5fb5c00fd6595a3b","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abhishek Sachidanandan","original_name":"Abhishek Sachidanandan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69606c07e8bef375f2595a14","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abhishek Sachidanandan","original_name":"Abhishek Sachidanandan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69606c259347ebdc6cf3fd73","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanzin Nordan","original_name":"Stanzin Nordan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69606c457839d2211a3d5ff3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
