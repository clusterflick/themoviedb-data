Work developed during the LUMA Arles Residency Program and commissioned by Fundação Bienal de São Paulo for the 36th Bienal.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/Abd36nI7eSAaCTSSWglbBDhKAuE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":285645,"logo_path":"/tiF9WE8M9G507niee8cx7J4KsT4.png","name":"Fundação Bienal de São Paulo","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2025-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"what colours can we dream in this night filled with salt?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"com quais cores podemos sonhar nesta noite repleta de sal?","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boras Choir","original_name":"Boras Choir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Choir","credit_id":"69604eaf071be614233d5e3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothée Munyaneza","original_name":"Dorothée Munyaneza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"69604eceeb83cb1025d142f0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2724452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julianknxx","original_name":"Julianknxx","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696011f65fb5c00fd65957f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1350,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Abd36nI7eSAaCTSSWglbBDhKAuE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":899}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"36ª Bienal de São Paulo","release_date":"2025-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
