Gabrielle “Gabby” Platt, a single mother who survived being shot three times, rides to inspire her young son with every push of the pedal. Ryen Reed, born with cerebral palsy, defies medical expectations as she pushes her body beyond its limits in pursuit of a place at the LA 2028 Paralympic Games. Oksana Masters, born in Ukraine with birth defects linked to the Chernobyl disaster, transforms profound hardship into triumph as a multiple time Paralympic gold medalist. Guiding them is Carlos Moleda, a Brazilian born former Navy SEAL who turned his own catastrophic injury into purpose by becoming a champion of adaptive athletics. Together, they train with relentless intensity, pushing past pain, trauma, and stigma - not just to win medals, but to redefine what resilience looks like.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/450iVv14HdVPnI82GUYHom6iul8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":285658,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pássaro Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Three extraordinary athletes defy trauma, disability, and society’s limits to pursue their Paralympic dreams under the mentorship of a former Navy SEAL, proving that resilience and the power of sport can rewrite what’s possible.","title":"Racing for Paralympic Gold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabby Platt","original_name":"Gabby Platt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Gabby Platt","credit_id":"696065a9a361b0647c363dbf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryen Reed","original_name":"Ryen Reed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ryen Reed","credit_id":"696065bc48a4895238595a09","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Moleda","original_name":"Carlos Moleda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Carlos Moleda","credit_id":"696065cf8915431aa31d7d5f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4909990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oksana Masters","original_name":"Oksana Masters","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/sz37egTWdDIGQn04SRVqL97tb87.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Oksana Masters","credit_id":"696065e4a361b0647c363dc3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5927368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gay Masters","original_name":"Gay Masters","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gay Masters","credit_id":"696065f2eb03527b571d7d9f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
