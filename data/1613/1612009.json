Anna, a photographer, arrives at Tel Aviv Old Central Bus Station as part of an artistic project and offers a ride to Eileen, nicknamed \"Flower,\" a young homeless woman, drug addict, and sex worker. A deep mutual curiosity leads them to initiate further meetings, and the two embark on a road trip through the dark and violent backstreets of Tel Aviv. During their weekly meetings, Flower's life story gradually unfolds. Anna's car becomes a safe space, a confessional booth into which Flower and others whose lives are intertwined with hers occasionally enter. This is not a story of salvation but of a profound emotional bond that reveals the cracks and strengths of human existence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flower","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36918959","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
