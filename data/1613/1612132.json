John tries to make excuses, but Smith is reinforced with several friends, who pile John into their car and rush him off to the links. John is a novice at the game and loses more than his golf balls on the course, but the few times he hits the elusive pellet fill him so with pride that he soon forgets all about Wifey in the whirl of the play. He is sorely grieved, however, when he gets a black eye from a flying ball.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Golf Game and the Bonnet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bunny","original_name":"John Bunny","popularity":0.7542,"profile_path":"/jKA4iSzu1mCzPEP5U3kKBxJRpgt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"John - The Husband","credit_id":"695fa3ffa386d24944276c6b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":998697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flora Finch","original_name":"Flora Finch","popularity":0.4305,"profile_path":"/r1Af5GrRy6uKDRwsWTxrsitpmIy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Flora - The Wife","credit_id":"695fa40f5477c27d4bb0522d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1463108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wally Van","original_name":"Wally Van","popularity":0.5015,"profile_path":"/o7Uc2fhwQQXWxgsk0pcqiQBQ510.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Smith","credit_id":"695fa41d757fbf4107383e0e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Leslie","original_name":"Richard Leslie","popularity":0.3878,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"695fa42b86683607623906a8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George D.
