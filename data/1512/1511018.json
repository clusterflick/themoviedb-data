Alla Indiano?","overview":"Three foreign students—two young men and a young woman—find themselves lost in translation in a bustling new country. Craving a familiar meal, they set off on what becomes a comically frustrating journey from one restaurant to another. Though the dish they long for is available everywhere, language barriers prevent them from communicating their order. A light-hearted yet poignant tale about miscommunication, cultural disconnection, and the universal comfort of food.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":201824,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film and Television Institute of India (FTII)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alla Romano?
