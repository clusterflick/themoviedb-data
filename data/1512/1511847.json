While Under Milk Wood lifted the lid on the small Welsh village of Laugharne over the course of one single day, Blue Monday lifts the lid on the lives and loves of the large city of Cardiff. Blue Monday, the most stressful night of the year. Four people with a decision to make, one that could change their lives. A cabbie, two police officers, a bar maid and a nurse (who also works in a neighbourhood brothel). One woman prepares for a reunion with a daughter she gave away at birth, another will have to choose between survival and family, a taxi driver comes to a shattering decision regarding his lover, while two police officers wrestle with their own demons while attempting to deal with the demons of others. A night of decisions. Followed by days of regret. Or not.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/qevsj0e0a5g1xjJ5Sl6c9CcA8YN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One Night, One Street, 4 Decisions","title":"Blue Monday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3581975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Ashton","original_name":"James Ashton","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jed","credit_id":"68710d47af21e0729cba2e36","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1078898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Elis","original_name":"Richard Elis","popularity":0.1592,"profile_path":"/abydXNsvfCExqtwpncXoPJ2pdjK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Keiron","credit_id":"68710d61064c4eae466e9ba9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicola Reynolds","original_name":"Nicola Reynolds","popularity":0.1548,"profile_path":"/bpsFdyGDNqDpOeAGgsfqebIOm0Z.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sue","credit_id":"68710d6eaa8bc20041ba2c91","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2023530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynne Seymour","original_name":"Lynne Seymour","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/dMQS7bE1eoPiegJP5jxfpnUMC3d.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mairead","credit_id":"68710d870849184ac2ba2bc4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2796348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Mengo","original_name":"Lee Mengo","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/4vspbU7NZDAhPXuzaoPtzQE4O21.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Danny","credit_id":"68710d9354dc98874aba2c96","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1528818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Norton","original_name":"John Norton","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/dncdbRoXgfgtk04deztiKjtA0U4.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mr. Bennet","credit_id":"68710dacf4b9b08bc151fa07","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2980786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean Rehman","original_name":"Dean Rehman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Burglar","credit_id":"68710dbbdf11df65fa541e4f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keiron Self","original_name":"Keiron Self","popularity":0.173,"profile_path":"/fCLytYxV7itLyPkNG4vuHsfguYF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Chris The Taxi","credit_id":"68710dce5abbb69e3d9a5ac2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1132565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kerry Joy Stewart","original_name":"Kerry Joy Stewart","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":"/3rrdDEO7HXOq6vcYxdLKUP11Nxd.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Lil and Cara - 2 roles","credit_id":"68710de06036f18987541c0c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4407982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tonya Smith","original_name":"Tonya Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Leanne","credit_id":"68710df5a1aab494bc7048a2","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2312331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mali Tudno Jones","original_name":"Mali Tudno Jones","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Toni","credit_id":"68710e0a980d1a63c7a97268","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1782433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzanne Phillips","original_name":"Suzanne Phillips","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68710d26f6ff1a25916e9a55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1227579,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rob Gittins","original_name":"Rob Gittins","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68710d32a5a9370ce310518f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5068926","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qevsj0e0a5g1xjJ5Sl6c9CcA8YN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
