A seasoned detective arrives to investigate, but what begins as a suicide case soon spirals into a psychological nightmare. As visions blur and hallucinations take hold, tribal symbols, unsolved murders, and haunting memories of a lost love surface. The line between perception and truth dissolves, dragging the investigator into the very madness he sought to understand.  FLOWER X, directed by Prabir Pachal, is a psychological thriller laced with romance, mysticism, and dread. It explores how memory, identity, and grief can be manipulated by unseen forcesâ€”where even a single breath can change everything.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1BaGrdai4pXX2srQIJaDk63fRNi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":266360,"logo_path":null,"name":"ELMECK FILMS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"FLOWER X , Mysterious & Psychological ,ðŸŒ¹ Romantic & Haunting ,ðŸŒ€ Surreal & Dark","title":"FLOWER X       Mysterious & Psychological         Romantic & Haunting        Surreal & Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5528615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prabir Pachal","original_name":"Prabir Pachal","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/a1EQRHRaQnHfUnMNexgfbUANSWi.jpg","credit_id":"6871e65ebb64f77f45704a9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5551106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shantanu Basu","original_name":"Shantanu Basu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wL1pSxnfsH1xdiONGpILFiOgaEA.jpg","credit_id":"6871e6bda46a022c97a977c2","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5528615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prabir Pachal","original_name":"Prabir Pachal","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/a1EQRHRaQnHfUnMNexgfbUANSWi.jpg","credit_id":"6871e7d214a3ea9170a97903","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":864,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8goZM87R5NoFINWO32P9YIq3Ltv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1137,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1BaGrdai4pXX2srQIJaDk63fRNi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":758}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":211197,"name":"mysterious death"},{"id":316362,"name":"thriller"},{"id":316790,"name":"psychological suspense thriller"},{"id":355159,"name":"missing truth"},{"id":355160,"name":"emotional & romantic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
