Only after he's escaped does he discover that he's stolen a very small amount of money. Instead of a trip to Paris, he ends up on a coach trip to Ireland - before running out of cash and begging to be arrested and sent home. Unfortunately, Ireland is another country - and he hasn't committed a crime there.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5075,"logo_path":"/9KTaY2KNITk7pWJlR8wfNcMRdQj.png","name":"S4C","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1986-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mae'n Talu Withe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2023536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Bowen","original_name":"Anne Bowen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Doris","credit_id":"6871309348bea9d2d0541b19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1245413,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Angie Brown","original_name":"Angie Brown","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sheila","credit_id":"687130d10a2ea4778351f7eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eluned Jones","original_name":"Eluned Jones","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Brenda","credit_id":"687130e64abcca6ce1ba2cf6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Pierce Jones","original_name":"John Pierce Jones","popularity":0.1833,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Police sargeant","credit_id":"687130fde097f755b8105258","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1144679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronica Quilligan","original_name":"Veronica Quilligan","popularity":0.2084,"profile_path":"/ikuq26rgsXzzGLGehbKkv8OOf6A.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Brenda","credit_id":"6871311481b466753654175a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3195908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annest Williams","original_name":"Annest Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Williams","credit_id":"6871313f4621fbdb675200ec","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":585958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Williams","original_name":"Ronnie Williams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lorrie","credit_id":"6871315c172af16ba29a5bb4","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Monger","original_name":"Christopher Monger","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687130018f328cfe3351fb61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Monger","original_name":"Christopher Monger","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68713010940547aa229a5c57","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1561762","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cy","note":"","release_date":"1986-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
