Could these strange stories be a clue to what might happen to life today and in the future? The film shifts in time and scale. It shows the deep past of tree cells splitting while reproducing and the prehistory of forest, last alive 4,500 years ago in Cardigan Bay.  It draws on Welsh archaeology, ancient forest and questions the past and future of communities, territory and trees. Do the uncanny scenes of the past with their tantalising sounds reflect the strangeness associated with our times of local and global heating and ecological breakdown?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trees Emerge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-Pierre Leroux","original_name":"Marie-Pierre Leroux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686ed4a43443346997a967bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
