Through exclusive interviews and vivid first-person accounts, the film traces the formation of the Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP), the surge in popularity of the tour, and the sport’s unprecedented popularity. But the story doesn't end at the top.  Witness the unraveling—how financial missteps and organizational instability led to the AVP’s dramatic fall and eventual bankruptcy, leaving a void for players, sponsors, and fans alike.  Told by the athletes, promoters, executives, and insiders who lived it, this is a story of competition, stardom and in some cases, heartbreak. Their collective passion is undeniable. And one question echoes throughout: can beach volleyball ever reclaim the spotlight it once owned?","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":293,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The golden era of Professional Beach Volleyball","title":"Kings of Summer** The Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
