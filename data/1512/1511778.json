With no crew, no map, and no one to impress, she bikes the coast, swims under moonlight, and fills her journal with poetry and Polaroids. Haunted by the feeling she's meant for something more-but unsure what that even means-Ziggy sets out on a quiet quest for identity, healing, and purpose. As the tide pulls away the past, she slowly begins to discover the girl she's becoming in the stillness between waves. A raw, atmospheric coming-of-age tale about growing up without a script-and finding freedom in solitude.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":4,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"No crew, no plan, just a girl in the waves","title":"OBX","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
