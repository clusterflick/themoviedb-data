Here, beneath the sacred vaults of the Basilica of St Francis, the frescoes of the great Italian master Giotto di Bondone shine like windows opening onto the divine. This documentary invites viewers on a mystical journey through the artistic genius of Giotto and the life of Saint Francis, taking a fresh look at works that are hundreds of years old, while delving into recent discoveries that have shed new light on the history of art. The work of the brushes of the great Italian painter is an opportunity to pray and to savour the grace of God, so majestically evoked in the Umbrian basilica.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/uUpN8h9UXT0Ik7M3WQ8rpI9HGu1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Divine Brushes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frère Giulio Cesareo","original_name":"Frère Giulio Cesareo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"686eabcf9dbe918916104497","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Panzini","original_name":"Sara Panzini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"686eabeb6d007f066d1044ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milvia Bollati","original_name":"Milvia Bollati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"686eac0b4cc77f68c0ed684d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frère Simone Tenuti","original_name":"Frère Simone Tenuti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"686eac2527620ab32fe80455","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frère Jorge Rolando Fernàndez","original_name":"Frère Jorge Rolando Fernàndez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"686eac86829c5e59b5e805ae","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Fusetti","original_name":"Sergio Fusetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"686eaca571b75ad374a969c9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frère Marco Moroni","original_name":"Frère Marco Moroni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"686eacba919517ace9a96f70","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monseigneur Patrick Valdrini","original_name":"Monseigneur Patrick Valdrini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"686eacd42c4efacbc1540a5c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frère Richard Mwaba","original_name":"Frère Richard Mwaba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"686eacec2c4efacbc1540a67","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739602,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Genevieve Cosson","original_name":"Genevieve Cosson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686ead425cfab44819ed6829","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1960423,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christophe Millet","original_name":"Christophe Millet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686ead8162e78c9e6c9a519f","department":"Crew","job":"Mixing Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554165,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mathieu Vatin","original_name":"Mathieu Vatin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686eadf43773a7fdb951ee6e","department":"Editing","job":"Color Timer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2121178,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Grégory Schnebelen","original_name":"Grégory Schnebelen","popularity":0.1472,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686eaeac69fa3110009a508c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valentino N.
