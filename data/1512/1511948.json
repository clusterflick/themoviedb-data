Instead of being scattered across the country, they unite and appeal to the Ministry of Education. Their plea results in the establishment of a unique boarding school in Ein Gedi by the Dead Sea. The film intimately follows their year of living and studying in this temporary sanctuary, grappling with the death of their family members and friends, and forging unexpected bonds as they navigate their final year towards graduation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Always Together","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4288088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paz Schwartz","original_name":"Paz Schwartz","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687161e98de47e8a7e704aa1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4288088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paz Schwartz","original_name":"Paz Schwartz","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68716202adbf23ebc9a9788f","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5558315,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Artyom Dubitski","original_name":"Artyom Dubitski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687162255a3c40c600541b38","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5558316,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tommy Shafir","original_name":"Tommy Shafir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687162350a2ea4778351f91f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2887755,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tamara Mamon","original_name":"Tamara Mamon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6871624607dcb97b72a97598","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4059599,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sergio Liberman","original_name":"Sergio Liberman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687162540ad7681110ed7278","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilad Goldschmidt","original_name":"Gilad Goldschmidt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687162678a675c21b27048ab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803437,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander Levin","original_name":"Alexander Levin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687162853eb518ff69ba2de8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
