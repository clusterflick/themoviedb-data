It wasn’t the first time that mining threatened this region with its expansion projects. For over twenty years, Yanacocha—the largest open-pit gold mine in Latin America—has endangered water resources. In this context, from the heart of the Andean jalca, a women’s resistance was born. Neither attacks nor fear have managed to stop these women who, with conviction and hope, raise their voices in the fight to protect life, Pachamama, and water. Three years later, the Blue Ladies are still standing, singing for freedom.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las damas azules","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bérengère Sarrazin","original_name":"Bérengère Sarrazin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686eba984a4b44a0daa96cc4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
