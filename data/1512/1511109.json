She presses down on memories from 70 years ago with sharp colored pencils. The drawing paper is filled with American soldiers arriving by helicopter, soldiers holding clubs, and skeletons rolling on the beach. As she draws, the memories of that time become clearer. The colors of the buttons the soldiers wore and the bloodstains on their palms come back to her mind. She cannot forget the sight of the blood of the dead soaking into the soil and glistening in the sunlight. That is how Grandma Wan-soon testifies through her drawings.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Wan-soon Draws","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
