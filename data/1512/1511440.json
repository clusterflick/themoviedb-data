After losing heavily at poker in the local hotel, he leaves for New York to see the sights and forget his troubles. A well-known actor sees him pass the club window, and is seized with a fancy to impersonate the grotesque old fellow. An \"accidental meeting\" is arranged, and the actor studies his original. He makes up, and goes to Jenkins' home town, where his agreeable personality soon turns the popular mind in Hi's favor. He wins at poker. The spinster smiles upon him. And when Jenkins returns, having received a tip from the actor, that if he is silent all will be well, he finds himself the best-liked man in the village. His grouchy disposition never comes back. And he marries the lady of his choice.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Actor and the Rube","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Actor and the Bumpkin","type":"Alternate Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riley Chamberlin","original_name":"Riley Chamberlin","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":"/rP8UIEIXirhNcKWRK1gZ6rFRq0V.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Actor","credit_id":"686fc5d21d0ef79eab7040e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boyd Marshall","original_name":"Boyd Marshall","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/5ROM2TU4pC4O3TBXnuuh2AVpzgf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Actor's Friend","credit_id":"686fc5ed851c5576195417f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Hoyt","original_name":"Edward Hoyt","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hi Jenkins - The Rube","credit_id":"686fc612e56c47a84c6e9504","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5121159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Post","original_name":"Leo Post","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"686fc647f75eacd43f104c54","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3301764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Reinhardt","original_name":"John Reinhardt","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/2SNGdGjr5OaYCTlTyT7mPFixaTC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"686fc6714cb158d7bded6f72","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1860196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Jones","original_name":"Morgan Jones","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/p6i6dkjmeOgopaT31qgr5kJurZS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"686fc7fdaf21e0729cba279a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1634101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Clarendon","original_name":"Hal Clarendon","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"686fc83c5a3c40c6005412b1","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0404720","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1915-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1915-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
