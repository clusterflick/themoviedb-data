In contrast, the title sequence, added in 1971, shows Broodthaers’s drawn storyboards filmed with a moving camera. The film was shown for the first time at the Galerie Michael Werner in Cologne in 1971, and a second film Le Poisson est Tenace, was created partly from its out-takes.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/nuSLMeSS7IIAnFfrG55w4kFxk4H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Projet Pour Un Poisson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Broodthaers","original_name":"Marcel Broodthaers","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686ea740af6b528508ed6b7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nuSLMeSS7IIAnFfrG55w4kFxk4H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
