They live in small-town Texas, where they spend time roaming fields and driving in their truck together. While this is happening, though, Brando is flirting with a girl at his job, showing that he is possibly scared of being gay. Wilson is clearly in love with Brando, but they both have a hard time getting their feelings across. These interactions eventually lead to a kiss on a rooftop, where Wilson ends up pulling away. After Brando gets out of work, they get into his truck and share a kiss, evidently tense as marked by the thunder occurring right after.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":260382,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Republic Records","origin_country":""},{"id":256059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Republic Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"wilson + brando, forever...","title":"This Song","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1453680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Fogelmanis","original_name":"Corey Fogelmanis","popularity":1.5475,"profile_path":"/nqAps1IQ9uBZlTNu7jZa2nmAXXa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Brando","credit_id":"687171101d0ef79eab704a07","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3149374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conan Gray","original_name":"Conan Gray","popularity":0.3557,"profile_path":"/rvrM7Rs8JWiK14wy18ukDq3LdVw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wilson","credit_id":"687171292e4f1002429a5d08","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5558356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danica Kleinknecht","original_name":"Danica Kleinknecht","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68717299a722d3894b1056c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5558445,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ethan Gruska","original_name":"Ethan Gruska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687172ca65e69f4515ba2fec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3149374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conan Gray","original_name":"Conan Gray","popularity":0.3557,"profile_path":"/rvrM7Rs8JWiK14wy18ukDq3LdVw.jpg","credit_id":"6871731e8a675c21b27048ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1556,"name":"texas"},{"id":207981,"name":"south"},{"id":346488,"name":"gay"},{"id":348563,"name":"lgbtq+"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Conan Gray - This Song (Official Video)","key":"qgFNCy6u4UQ","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-05-30T04:00:06.000Z","id":"687170ea54dc98874aba2eb0"}]}}}
