Using the story of Pennhurst State School and Hospital in eastern Pennsylvania as an example of the abuse and neglect that was taking place on a national level, the program details how those with intellectual disabilities were treated in society, the resulting changes that were needed, and the community-based efforts in place today. Archival photos and footage along with interviews with people with intellectual disabilities, advocates, researchers, scientists, parents, social workers, and many more help raise awareness about the issue and shine a light on the struggles and triumphs of the disability rights movement.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":188826,"logo_path":null,"name":"WITF","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"i go home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5553997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keira McGuire","original_name":"Keira McGuire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686e97a8432b8e72991045aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5553997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keira McGuire","original_name":"Keira McGuire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686e97d74621fbdb6751f4a2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5553998,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mitch Mathias","original_name":"Mitch Mathias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686e97ec62e78c9e6c9a512f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5553998,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mitch Mathias","original_name":"Mitch Mathias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686e97f71b9a8ab1e8a9656f","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5553999,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Doug Watson","original_name":"Doug Watson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686e98127aab150fb9703c41","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5554000,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cara Williams Fry","original_name":"Cara Williams Fry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686e982371b75ad374a9693f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6458948","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
