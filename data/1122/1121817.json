But just like the Beyblades that spin in unpredictable directions, Chris is embarking on a different life path. Before Chris’s departure, they continue to linger around the neighbourhood playing with friends, uncertain about the future and how to say farewell. Tuen Mun, through the director’s lens, is slightly tinged with melancholy, resembling both a maze and a playground. In a child’s imaginative and innocent perspective, the film makes poignant observations on the anxieties of the adult world during the pandemic and how people deal with inevitable losses.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/g13vlR8Vt9X6yj5agy51xjG29g2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before the Box Gets Emptied","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tang Siu-kit","original_name":"Tang Siu-kit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"645326b133ad8f01380d3e4c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ling Ching-kin","original_name":"Ling Ching-kin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"645326c187a27a01723c71d5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4326630,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Timothy Chan","original_name":"Timothy Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652f9eb2caef2d0139dffa69","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4043808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ho Sze-wai","original_name":"Ho Sze-wai","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/8hO2qYEmXGJ4kV8BknELbhd7zbv.jpg","credit_id":"645326d2091e62016530f4e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4043808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ho Sze-wai","original_name":"Ho Sze-wai","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/8hO2qYEmXGJ4kV8BknELbhd7zbv.jpg","credit_id":"645326ddd8f44e0daf4ac8a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043809,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shew Wing-tung","original_name":"Shew Wing-tung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645326f787a27a015431fbdf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g13vlR8Vt9X6yj5agy51xjG29g2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1413}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2023-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
