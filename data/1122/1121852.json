Joy was a director, animator, producer and designer and one half of the Halas & Batchelor Cartoons Studio, which made the UKs first animated feature film, Animal Farm, in 1954. Although a crucial figure in British animation, she has for years been unfairly passed over for recognition. This short film made in her honour seeks to redress that balance and to introduce Joy's work to a wider audience. The film was produced by her daughter, Vivien Halas.","popularity":0.1345,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Halas and Batchelor Cartoon Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ode to Joy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":70709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joy Batchelor","original_name":"Joy Batchelor","popularity":0.2448,"profile_path":"/clu21ayGIdTZfl0qEd0JGMJlPLd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64534b51091e62018650498f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivien Halas","original_name":"Vivien Halas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64534b96d48cee0136d92d4c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933479,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martin Pickles","original_name":"Martin Pickles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64534b8533ad8f00fef36953","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933479,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martin Pickles","original_name":"Martin Pickles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64534b8cd8f44e0db19f7d15","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
