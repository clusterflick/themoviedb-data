John is a key figure in British cinema and his contribution goes far beyond making Animal Farm in 1954, Britain's first animated feature-film. He produced more than 2000 films between 1938 and 1995, launched the careers of hundreds of British animators and was a visionary who wanted to create a post-WWII utopia through Socialism, animation and international understanding. The film was commissioned and produced by his daughter Vivien Halas who runs the Halas & Batchelor archive.","popularity":0.187,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Halas Remembered: An Animator Ahead of His Time 1912-1995","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Halas","original_name":"John Halas","popularity":0.1421,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"645349e987a27a00e38f5e4a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933479,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martin Pickles","original_name":"Martin Pickles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645349d6091e62010277d94d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivien Halas","original_name":"Vivien Halas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645349b687a27a0138a670d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933479,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martin Pickles","original_name":"Martin Pickles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645349c4d48cee017025f023","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD / Blu-Ray","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
