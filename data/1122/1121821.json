Frank, a middle-aged hairdresser in Berlin, is performing his daily routine. Coincidences bring them together, though their friendship is dictated by the parameters of the smartphone. Kevin decides to adapt the stories of the Berlin Wall to the stage, as old memories of living in East Berlin come flooding back to Frank. Shadows, in their literal and metaphorical sense, become the third wheel which silently alters their lives and turns into a story that transcends the boundaries of reason. Through this experimental work, director Terence LI sheds light on the inner space-time of the queer and the displaced.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/ToIliGiSXnSmjJBCJjJgNoN0UF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only the Shadows Move","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anderson Tsang Man-kin","original_name":"Anderson Tsang Man-kin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64532950d48cee0119a0efd3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Meyer","original_name":"Marcus Meyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64532966fd630001385c14b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Rademacher","original_name":"Ben Rademacher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6453297cc04429010161a5c0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terence Li","original_name":"Terence Li","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6453299433ad8f011b3f5ad6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terence Li","original_name":"Terence Li","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6453299ed48cee0136d919cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043822,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kitty Yeung","original_name":"Kitty Yeung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645329b633ad8f01728dd9bc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043823,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Cemil Sorgun","original_name":"Cemil Sorgun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645329c9c044290143e33696","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043824,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vitor Bunkenburg","original_name":"Vitor Bunkenburg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645329dcd48cee0119a0f02b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043825,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hu Yat-lam","original_name":"Hu Yat-lam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645329ebfd630000fe604d60","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ToIliGiSXnSmjJBCJjJgNoN0UF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2023-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
