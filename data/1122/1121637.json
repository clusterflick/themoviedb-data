He was destined to take over the family farm, but the war stories that rocked his childhood change his dreams. Having become a doctor, he went to see wars up close: Biafra, Vietnam, Afghanistan, South Sudan. In 1969 at the Santana hospital in Biafra, he fought against the famine which was ravaging children. He and his friends will be nicknamed the Frenchs Doctors; they create Médecins Sans Frontières with Bernard Kouchner.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/rxnIUbzj1pr6yH0f9XcLzwt5i6L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90917,"logo_path":"/svm1615RvI6FgW50ZewmyqhQWr7.png","name":"Supermouche Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Louis Schittly, de terre et de guerre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Schittly","original_name":"Louis Schittly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6452c005d8f44e0db0713e9a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Kouchner","original_name":"Bernard Kouchner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/8mvKcBFm8SdzUeHxtx40CcP2NSM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6452c01087a27a00e38f0fa7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1858410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Froehly","original_name":"Vincent Froehly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (french TV voice)","credit_id":"6452c056d48cee0119a0ac84","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1858410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Froehly","original_name":"Vincent Froehly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6452bed5d8f44e0db19f2c32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/rxnIUbzj1pr6yH0f9XcLzwt5i6L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
