Barthes did not publish these writings during his lifetime. His unsettling judgments about China are refracted in Peng Zuqiang‘s work Sight Leak, as fragments of dialogues on class and looking. The local tourist in the film travels through different spaces and gatherings, seemingly never looking at anyone, yet silently looking at someone, turning towards a certain collectivity in spite of a foreign homoerotic gaze.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/uu2HUIuHCCKevZpgmbtwo3SJWTZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2022-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sight Leak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1937039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peng Zuqiang","original_name":"Peng Zu-Qiang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670bdee7f58a9206aa40f969","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uu2HUIuHCCKevZpgmbtwo3SJWTZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
