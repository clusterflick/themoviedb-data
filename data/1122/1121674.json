The procession starred the fabulously voluptuous and successful London Hippodrome actress Vera Guedes as Godiva. The film begins with a lingering shot of Godiva, in her flesh-coloured dress, on her horse highlighting her significance in the procession. The remaining extracts lose her as a focus, as the procession is used as a vehicle to exhibit local trade.","popularity":0.0554,"poster_path":"/2ffUOi2wiar5TP2A5mJcXZ3xkh3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mitchell and Kenyon","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1902-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lady Godiva Procession in Coventry","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Guedes","original_name":"Vera Guedes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lady Godiva","credit_id":"6452cc6ed861af0138f38093","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043249,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sydney Carter","original_name":"Sydney Carter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6452cd5687a27a0138a6278f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sagar Mitchell","original_name":"Sagar Mitchell","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6452cd41d48cee0170259cbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Kenyon","original_name":"James Kenyon","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6452cd23d48cee0153ecc8ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2ffUOi2wiar5TP2A5mJcXZ3xkh3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1902-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"[4K, 60 fps, colorized] (1902) Lady Godiva procession in Coventry.","key":"ogUz3rZLhi4","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-03-16T20:13:10.000Z","id":"6524dfb7d399e601003deabf"}]}}}
