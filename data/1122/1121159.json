This 3D animated video proposes a new version of the fable, where its protagonist is a transgender vixen who, by means of its charms, achieves to attract the otter, unsettling colonial constructions about desire and heterosexuality and allowing to break these paradigms and create new cosmologies.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fox and Otter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4041337,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Roberto Riveros","original_name":"Roberto Riveros","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6451579eef9d7200e5e8d7e3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4041336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seba Calfuqueo","original_name":"Seba Calfuqueo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6451576f41429100e3ce55fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"M/18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
