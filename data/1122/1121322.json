Phil Philby, parapsychological PI and ex-C.I.A. hit man, took the case. A Cajun meth cooker, a sadistic country sheriff, sinister government agents, and a pricey Indian medicine man are only a few of their problems.\r Can they stop this horrific challenge to Homeland Security before the evil RV triggers the apocalypse? Hell-on-wheels takes on a horrific and hilarious new meaning. It's a wicked political satire that resonates with the weirdness of today s news. Motor Home From Hell rolls on axles of evil, powered by an infernal combustion engine of explosive, subversive humor.","popularity":0.0683,"poster_path":"/ydBSuZx2QBUFGZMZAOo1dNtobTZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motor Home From Hell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1086371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly McWilliams","original_name":"Holly McWilliams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6451eea387a27a00fe71afd9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4041906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Krudwig","original_name":"David Krudwig","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6451eeb2d48cee00fced0363","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4041908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Ayres","original_name":"Ron Ayres","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6451eec210561100ff37333f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1503090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Shelton","original_name":"Nathan Shelton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6451eed5091e6201234ede00","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4041910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross Payton","original_name":"Ross Payton","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6451eeeb87a27a0138a5bf91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ydBSuZx2QBUFGZMZAOo1dNtobTZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1064}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
