When A-mai gets pregnant, what follows is not necessarily a blessing. Like many lost-contact migrant workers in Taiwan who, worried that they cannot afford to raise their children, flee and take on cash-in-hand jobs, A-Li and A-Mai go up the mountain to a place full of lychee stink bugs where A-Li can earn some money. When stopped by the police, they escape into the mountains and forests for fear of their status as illegal migrant workers. Taking refuge inside an abandoned factory, the couple tries to evade the police and to ensure the safe delivery of the baby.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/c2auxkCGkO9ySqfsVX6CRuHHffe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eggs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nguyen Ngoc-anh","original_name":"Nguyen Ngoc-anh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6453280dd48cee017025dde0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bui Van-quy","original_name":"Bui Van-quy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6453281d091e62010277c93b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4043814,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Saito Chong","original_name":"Saito Chong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64532837d48cee0136d918e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4043814,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Saito Chong","original_name":"Saito Chong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6453283cfd630001731a548c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4043814,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Saito Chong","original_name":"Saito Chong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64532845d48cee00e1333a3f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4043815,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chen Chung-you","original_name":"Chen Chung-you","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6453285ad8f44e0db19f6b66","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5025455,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jo-En Huang","original_name":"黃若恩","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671e3a336e4210780f79508f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c2auxkCGkO9ySqfsVX6CRuHHffe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2023-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kaohsiung Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
