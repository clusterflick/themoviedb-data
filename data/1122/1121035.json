On 24 December in 1923, Thomas van Wiggen and his sister Gerrigje were murdered in Culemborg. Several suspects were arrested in the investigation, but ultimately no one was convicted of the double robbery-homicide. We see a demonstration held by the local inhabitants, directed against Police Commissioner Blok, who was accused of poorly handling the police investigation. Amid these shots, we see images of two football matches: Vriendenschaar - Sparta (1-0) and Culemborg II - Haaften I. The latter match ended in a draw.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hoSDetC78oDlE94i3kmJ8fGu7vF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinematograaf Pathé Frères (Nederland)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1924-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Culemborg Journal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hoSDetC78oDlE94i3kmJ8fGu7vF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1924-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
