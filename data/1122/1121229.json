The three artists created the work while in residence at the Falaise Fieldhouse over the entire month of July 2017 - and then share their finished installation on Saturday July 29th from 9:00pm-1am at 3434 Falaise Avenue, Vancouver BC Canada.  This is part of the Iris Film Collective IN HOUSE series.  Using found 16mm footage that has women as subject (unsurprisingly limited on ebay) this collaborative team transformed the footage (and fieldhouse) into something that speaks more authentically to the female experience. Titles such as: Jobs for Women - 1942, Volleyball Technique for Girls - 1957 & Correctol Women's Laxative Commercial - 1960's will experience a mash-up as the artists explore the womanâ€™s place.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CHICK FLICK","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4041527,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cheryl Hamilton","original_name":"Cheryl Hamilton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64517e0333ad8f011b3e7db0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2331375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa G.
