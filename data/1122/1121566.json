The documentary focuses on the Gospel For All Christian Church (ICEPT), one of the first Christian churches in Brazil to preach Inclusive Theology, and presents testimonies of regulars who experienced rejection within their former faith space due to homosexuality. Theological scholars, representatives of ICEPT and religious members in favor and against inclusive churches participate in the project developing the subject from the human, historical and theological bias of the theme.","popularity":0.0693,"poster_path":"/gg6hxAz5SplcNGcS9LnsFko0GET.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199223,"logo_path":null,"name":"Firehouse
