Approached with a sitcom-esque irreverence, the work is a surreal affair. Rather than indie celebrities, two stereotypically balaclava-clad robbers arrive uninvited, with tote bags (in preparation) to climb through an open window to browse, rate, and berate the unlucky occupant’s collection. Judkins has invented various musicians with such a strong and truthful visual sensibility that they feel strangely timeless, while also conjuring an exact image of the usual coterie of artists discussed by the guests on the format.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/A0DIrfj9PoAyCdNV9o5l5ac1FGN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What's In My Bag?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4040962,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Louis Judkins","original_name":"Louis Judkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6451362f43501100ea3a1572","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4040962,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Louis Judkins","original_name":"Louis Judkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64513623435011015e9275db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4040962,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Louis Judkins","original_name":"Louis Judkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6451363c93bd6900e5fe876d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A0DIrfj9PoAyCdNV9o5l5ac1FGN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
