Ann, who has moved to Norway, is facing obstacles on multiple fronts: visa, employment, cultural differences, racism and an unexpected pregnancy, which puts her relationship with her girlfriend in jeopardy, another secret hovering over the already strained relationship with her mother. Instead of trying to simply stay afloat, the worst person in the world now has to make a decision and reclaim her life. The director who also writes the script and plays the main role expresses through the short her own experience as a Chinese diaspora and creative talent living in Europe.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/csvvlqZQdaEz3U0PvSyVrpdmqq3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong
