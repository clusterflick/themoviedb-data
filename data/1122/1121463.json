From their start in 1971 to breakup in late 1979, a cast of talent — including lead singer Michael Reidy, drummer Doug Tull, bassist Ted Niceley and guitarists Bill Craig, Abaad Behram and the late Tommy Keene — became a wholly original rock band amid a club scene dominated by cover bands, and a record industry that found them impossible to label.
