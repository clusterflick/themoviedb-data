Valeria is plonked in the middle of Dartmoor without speaking a word of the English language and the film follows her quest to settle into Devon life. She faces a series of challenges that are soothed by an unlikely cross generational friendship with another refugee called Tina who allows her to come to terms with everything she has lost.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":199198,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isosceles Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green Country","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4042151,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophia Seymour","original_name":"Sophia Seymour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6452c07fc04429010161612b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
