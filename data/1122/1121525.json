After an untimely cardiac attack, CHEUNG wakes up and finds himself onboard a flight of the Afterlife Airline, and learns that the destination depends on the testimonies of the witnesses, who will determine whether CHEUNG has led a meaningful life. Will CHEUNG be able to find someone who approves of his life as a cloudmaker and send him to the realm of eternal bliss? With cloud as an allusion to dream/life, the thought-provoking short features a strong cast including CHU Pak-hong, Kaki SHAM and Candice YU On-on, against a fantastic set design reminiscent of Michel GONDRY’s dreamscapes.","popularity":0.4226,"poster_path":"/wFsByIyp0ntbvdGvjIz9FT857FW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hong Kong Film Arts Association","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2023-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life of Cloud","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2684219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Chu Pak-Hong","original_name":"朱栢康","popularity":0.772,"profile_path":"/hGpToKjLUDXbz69NjCriRcBHYv8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6452854433ad8f01380cec87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sham Ka-Ki","original_name":"岑珈其","popularity":0.3933,"profile_path":"/8fHdK9loa7tKDXBLZ6QFIjjvYo3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6452854b33ad8f01380cec8c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3047460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thor Lok","original_name":"Thor Lok","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/l0smHMt71LPPQBHe7kP43hWCZdk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6452855bd48cee0119a093a2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candice Yu On-On","original_name":"余安安","popularity":0.4251,"profile_path":"/3k3q31QUY7uvvY28end5Pl1jBF5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6452857233ad8f011b3f0760","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208453,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Allen Leung","original_name":"Allen Leung","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64546b0ad48cee00fcee5762","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wylie Chan Wai-Yi","original_name":"陳惠沂","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645285ab33ad8f011b3f0794","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wylie Chan Wai-Yi","original_name":"陳惠沂","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645285b733ad8f00fef30347","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wFsByIyp0ntbvdGvjIz9FT857FW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1413}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2023-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
