One afternoon, as she is dozing among the official forms and stamps, a telegraph arrives addressed to her. It is from her rich aunt, who lives in America and writes requesting that Christine join her and her husband in a Swiss Alpine resort. After a dizzying train ride, Christine finds herself at the top of the world, enjoying a life of privilege that she had never imagined. But Christine’s aunt drops her as abruptly as she picked her up, and soon the young woman is back at the provincial post office, consumed with disappointment and bitterness. Then she meets Ferdinand, a wounded but eloquent war veteran who is able to give voice to the disaffection of his generation. Christine’s and Ferdinand’s lives spiral downward, before Ferdinand comes up with a plan which will be either their salvation or their doom.","popularity":0.2906,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","title":"The Post Office Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1282054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Cookson","original_name":"Sophie Cookson","popularity":0.7602,"profile_path":"/3HrHnpDFjHIdHNeEyhEdzh6L6jd.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Christine","credit_id":"646e996271ffdf0148dff88c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard E.
