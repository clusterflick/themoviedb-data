A sun-kissed island in the Mediterranean Sea. At the southernmost part of this island, one DJ has been playing music all day, everyday at the same beach for 25 years. His name is Jon Sa Trinxa. Jon arrived at Ibiza on a hippie bus from London. \"Living on an island with the ocean and the sun. That was enough to lure me here.\" He came to Ibiza penniless, and to make matters worse, a fight with a friend was topped off with a car accident. How did he end up being a DJ at some beachside restaurant after so much misfortune? In paradise with pure freedom, he simply lives by his love of music in search of original musical styles, and DJs with a never-ending passion. His insatiable love for music has uniquely shaped his DJ style unlike any other person in the world. This documentary film portrays Ibiza's music scene and the life of \"the legendary DJ of Ibiza\" Jon Sa Trinxa who devoted his life to music.—Rinae, Lily","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/vAi9Dzx6xueCsJIwulggLxUqqwG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Born Balearic: Jon Sa Trinxa and the Spirit of Ibiza","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Sa Trinxa","original_name":"Jon Sa Trinxa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jon Sa Trinxa","credit_id":"613c344e46aed4002df881d4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Willson","original_name":"Andy Willson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Andy Willson","credit_id":"613c3461d7107e002a9f5a59","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Bager","original_name":"Kenneth Bager","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Kenneth Bager","credit_id":"613c346ffe5c91008a94d4b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Coco","original_name":"Chris Coco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"DJ Chris Coco","credit_id":"613c34976af9dd0027b5ccbe","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lily Rinae","original_name":"Lily Rinae","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613c33d4aaf897004211f446","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lily Rinae","original_name":"Lily Rinae","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613c33fc6af9dd004374263d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7988202","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vAi9Dzx6xueCsJIwulggLxUqqwG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Born Balearic: Jon Sa Trinxa and the Spirit of Ibiza","key":"gpTOyevypSQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-02-22T21:24:56.000Z","id":"613c34f7c68b69008d515594"}]}}}
