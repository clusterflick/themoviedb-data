The film presents an eye-witness account of training activities of the Royal Canadian 27th Infantry Brigade stationed at Hanover--Canada's forceful contribution to NATO ground forces for the defense of Western Europe. A sight-seeing tour of German countryside, an intense mock ground attack, and a military parade on Hanover's public square are the main features. Everywhere in the background is the mute eloquence of the last defeated aggression.","popularity":0.1654,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1952-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eye Witness No. 42 - Armed Forces Abroad: The 27th Brigade in Germany","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Mannis","original_name":"Harry Mannis","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"613e2df9a6ddcb008af19ba6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232112,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marion Meadows","original_name":"Marion Meadows","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613e2dc7006b010044703935","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bairstow","original_name":"David Bairstow","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613e2d416af9dd00437747df","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bairstow","original_name":"David Bairstow","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613e2d32aaf897002afca347","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicholas Balla","original_name":"Nicholas Balla","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613e2d5660c751008d8707da","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1586011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant McLean","original_name":"Grant McLean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613e2d6de2726000634d1d80","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586013,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Clarke Da Prato","original_name":"Clarke Da Prato","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613e2de30cd32a0043e4868d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
