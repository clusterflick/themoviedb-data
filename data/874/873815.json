The hero submerges into the bright lights of the streets, meets strangers, listens to pieces of theirs strange conversations. However, the further his walks, the more his surrounding changes: cold buildings of the industrial zone change the streetlights' warmth, a mysterious black car starts to follow him, and the metal cranes turn into weird creatures. The hero falls deeper into his thoughts. He examines his fears and ideals, losing the line between reality and the world in his head. Will he find what made him leave his home, or maybe he will be swallowed by the surrealistic realm he encountered?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/d29RjdUOTdM7jhmT0jNkFNi8MSW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2021-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soon After Midnight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Незабаром після опівночі","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Aleksaha","original_name":"Anton Aleksaha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"613f658460c7510042ec500f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Skerbina","original_name":"Serge Skerbina","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"613f659d149565002d37f827","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elijah Kravtsow","original_name":"Elijah Kravtsow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"613f65b4a6ddcb0042c1ffbd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Polina Vinogradova","original_name":"Polina Vinogradova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"613f65ccaaf897004217c69c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tetiana Usova","original_name":"Tetiana Usova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"613f65d9a6ddcb002c69d75c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmytro Koval","original_name":"Dmytro Koval","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613f66086af9dd0027bbe95c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmytro Koval","original_name":"Dmytro Koval","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613f66121495650043fcceb5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmytro Koval","original_name":"Dmytro Koval","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613f662260c751002af26baa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233272,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Danylo Okulov","original_name":"Danylo Okulov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613f6644a6ddcb0061c519d4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233272,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Danylo Okulov","original_name":"Danylo Okulov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613f666519ab590043de6a61","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmytro Koval","original_name":"Dmytro Koval","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613f66866af9dd00668b172c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15418132","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"soonaftermidnight","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d29RjdUOTdM7jhmT0jNkFNi8MSW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kyiv International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
