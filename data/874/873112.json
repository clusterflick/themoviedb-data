There’s a lot of nostalgia for the nineties at the moment, especially from people too young to remember it who see the decade as a simpler, pre-internet time. Modern nostalgia often draws on corporate American-90s mall culture, but what about British culture? With I’ve Been Trying To Tell You – made to accompany the Saint Etienne album of the same name – director Alasdair McLellan evokes the era through the fog of memory. The resulting film, shot in locations from Grangemouth to Portmeirion to Southampton, is both beautiful and enveloping.","popularity":0.2451,"poster_path":"/n3eolzEJpzmHjzimU8hkDMoUFe9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Saint Etienne present a beautiful and enveloping nostalgia trip through 1990s Britain.","title":"I've Been Trying to Tell You","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Saint Etienne: I’ve Been Trying to Tell You","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kit Butler","original_name":"Kit Butler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kit Butler","credit_id":"613c8f7daaf897008c021dbe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1960282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fern Bain Smith","original_name":"Fern Bain Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fern Bain Smith","credit_id":"613c8f8ad7107e0062b037de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Attal","original_name":"Nora Attal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nora Attal","credit_id":"613c8f949653f6002b8b48ff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3230359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"AJ Adamu","original_name":"AJ Adamu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"AJ Adamu","credit_id":"613c8fa460c7510042e6c493","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2560802,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Saint Etienne","original_name":"Saint Etienne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Saint Etienne","credit_id":"613c8fae9653f60043e77337","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alasdair McLellan","original_name":"Alasdair McLellan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613cadbea6ddcb0061c0338f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2560802,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Saint Etienne","original_name":"Saint Etienne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613c8fec08cf8700896b6252","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alasdair McLellan","original_name":"Alasdair McLellan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613c8ff9a6ddcb0042bc9c6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alasdair McLellan","original_name":"Alasdair McLellan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613c9002322b2b005fc9a57b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2560802,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Saint Etienne","original_name":"Saint Etienne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613c8fd15258ae0065a6d8c3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2560802,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Saint Etienne","original_name":"Saint Etienne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613cadcc60c751002aed79a3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2560802,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Saint Etienne","original_name":"Saint Etienne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613c900eaaf8970062b6605a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15732748","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"SaintEtienneOfficial","instagram_id":"saintetienneofficial","twitter_id":"bobpetesarah"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n3eolzEJpzmHjzimU8hkDMoUFe9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aKQAZonlpSdB6OkwHtJNRb75F9V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5609,"name":"nostalgia"},{"id":201253,"name":"dub music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Saint Etienne - I've Been Trying To Tell You - Official Trailer","key":"0ldhg1I7IgU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-07-30T17:24:31.000Z","id":"613c9099d7107e0044c31bd7"}]}}}
