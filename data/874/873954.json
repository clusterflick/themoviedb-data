Clay pretends to hunt down Rose with a gun in a playful, frisky way, but then they get to talking, as lovers do, about their near-death experiences. Clay talks about being stepped on by a horse, which put him in a hospital for weeks as he struggled to stay alive.  But Rose tells a story about her car breaking down on the deserted highway and being picked up by a man who is a murderer. Her only hope is creating some kind of connection with her potential killer, but that decision has its perils and unexpected consequences","popularity":0.2325,"poster_path":"/vqtB6kZPRWzvsp12LIfC0KasHtC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wheel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1301885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drago Sumonja","original_name":"Drago Sumonja","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":"/482NVwnMdmVpzBWIQPs3CZOu10q.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"613feb599c97bd00433461e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Traylor","original_name":"Susan Traylor","popularity":0.3876,"profile_path":"/mAQwOoUrf4Su4MOBPPn68q9JLPx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"613feb679450fe00430d66fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":183519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Stark","original_name":"Craig Stark","popularity":0.3891,"profile_path":"/r6KyyR7OPB1Bo3lBV51YPH9u47T.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"613feb9ed236e600672404fe","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Elizabeth Tillman","original_name":"Emma Elizabeth Tillman","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613feac9a6ddcb0061c62f3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Elizabeth Tillman","original_name":"Emma Elizabeth Tillman","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613feada5e12000020a945d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8582232","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vqtB6kZPRWzvsp12LIfC0KasHtC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
