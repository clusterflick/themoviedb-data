At the crucial point of relinquishing his realm, Lear demands to know which of his daughters loves him the most. His ambitious older daughters answer with false praise and lavish flattery, however his youngest daughter, who does truly love him, answers with honesty. Wildly unsatisfied with her response, Lear’s rage sets in motion catastrophic consequences. Ultimately stripped of his privilege and its trappings, Lear must reckon with his own humanity.","popularity":0.5927,"poster_path":"/c0pALld8927oFdEQ8fwjlD3aRJL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shakespeare & Company","origin_country":""},{"id":150517,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shakespeare Theatre Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King Lear","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Lloyd","original_name":"Christopher Lloyd","popularity":2.5212,"profile_path":"/nxVjpyb3UrfbPZnEyDNlQVlFAs5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"King Lear","credit_id":"613efbfd9450fe002cace569","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3078460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Epstein","original_name":"Jonathan Epstein","popularity":0.1452,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Earl of Kent","credit_id":"613efc6b0d1e7f0052487470","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1840641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel Gore","original_name":"Nigel Gore","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Earl of Gloucester","credit_id":"613efc801495650043fc6825","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3232805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryce Michael Wood","original_name":"Bryce Michael Wood","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Edmund","credit_id":"613efc900d1e7f002aebeeb4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MaConnia Chesser","original_name":"MaConnia Chesser","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Goneril","credit_id":"613efcb519ab590026f8f79c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3232808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bertoldi","original_name":"David Bertoldi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Duke of Albany / Oswald","credit_id":"613efce19979d200904e2eb2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennie M.
