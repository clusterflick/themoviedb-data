P. Dinsmoor’s fantastical backyard concrete and wood rendering of the Garden of Eden. Dinsmoor’s self-constructed and wildly imaginative figures represent one man’s attempt to make sense of the world in which he lived. A Civil War veteran, farmer, and self-taught artist, Dinsmoor created a work perhaps more relevant today than ever before; witness Dinsmoor’s Labor Crucified surrounded by a Doctor, a Lawyer, a Preacher, and a Banker to know that this garden is still thriving today. Adding to Dinsmoor’s triumph is the collective work of Montage Production’s Richard Grove, Richard J. Meyer, and Wayne Sourbeer, a trio of avant-garde filmmakers who simply and effectively captured the power of Dinsmoor’s architectural sculptures under the blue-gray skies of southeastern Kansas and further emboldens them using Dinsmoor’s own words.","popularity":0.1623,"poster_path":"/6y7AlG5nC6TjSIPNOCa6fBAbNRo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Montage Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Montage IV: The Garden of Eden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Gebhardt","original_name":"Guy Gebhardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"613e37f84cbe120061f6fab5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Grove","original_name":"Richard Grove","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613e383c56b9f700287e0e09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217227,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Kramer","original_name":"James Kramer","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613e387091745b006408da8b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard J.
