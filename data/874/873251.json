They dedicated their lives to belief in the revolution and its connection to avant-garde art, but the communist regime betrayed them. The history depicted on the painted canvases reflects the tumultuous period of the 1920s and 30s in the Soviet Union, in Leningrad and in artistic circles of the time. Only with perestroika have the avant-garde paintings, stored in museum archives, again seen the light of day.","popularity":0.0666,"poster_path":"/7gYd0SwyawQG5jRheoJk6NNolyE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50859,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vesterholt Film & Tv","origin_country":""},{"id":160773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quadrat Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Russian Avant-Garde: A Romance with the Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Русский авангард","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106651,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergey Dubrovsky","original_name":"Sergey Dubrovsky","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613d15776af9dd0043756be1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1650057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksandr Krivonos","original_name":"Aleksandr Krivonos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613d1223f96a3900435e832c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451825,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sonja Vesterholt","original_name":"Sonja Vesterholt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613d1281af959000238cac11","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0283576","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7gYd0SwyawQG5jRheoJk6NNolyE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":876}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Krakow Film Festival ","release_date":"2000-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
