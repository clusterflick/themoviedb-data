The film tells the story of refugee penguins leaving their home under threat of being skinned to go work in the Kool Cigarette factory in Louisville, Kentucky. They almost instantly adapt to their new factory jobs. On their way across the ocean to the U.S., they notice that New York is feeling down in the dumps under a very ‘happy’ sun. By the end of the cartoon, New York is a happy place to be once again, and to top off the evening’s events, the Statue of Liberty even gets a lesson in coolness.","popularity":0.0992,"poster_path":"/tkttTGPuMtJG3HKUzE3CySwT4Aq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160925,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brown and Williamson","origin_country":""},{"id":60288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Audio Productions Inc.","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KOOL Penguins","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599569,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"John Walworth","original_name":"John Walworth","popularity":0.1042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613feeaf8d22fc0044a647bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tkttTGPuMtJG3HKUzE3CySwT4Aq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1935-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
