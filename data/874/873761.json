For many animals, such human activity is gradually altering their land beyond habitable existence. Hunting in Africa for food, sport, and anger is drastically reducing animal populations. But there is still time to save and reconnect with nature. With governments protecting wild land, and through the Khoisan peoples' example of how to share life with other predatory animals, this ruminative doc explores how humans and animals might one day coexist in peace.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/4lCUA7nmvfhYNVggabeMFewOFBT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Wild","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8983552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4lCUA7nmvfhYNVggabeMFewOFBT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
