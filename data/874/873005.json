One day, Dudley Hamilt, a choirboy, throws his ball across the fence which separates the rectory from the Trenton yard and meets Felicia, from whom he steals a kiss. Trenton sees the children smooching and, shocked, sends Felicia to Canada. Years pass and Felicia, now an adult, decides to go to New York and make her living as a seamstress. She still yearns for Dudley but decides against seeing him because of her old-fashioned wardrobe. Possessing a natural talent for dancing, Felicia is offered a job by lecherous theatrical manager Allen Graemer, and she accepts. Dudley, attending one of her performances, recognizes his long-lost love and follows her home where he rescues her from Graemer's advances and admits his enduring love for the girl from whom he stole a kiss.","popularity":0.1086,"poster_path":"/ws9zLIwbphOlHv47ilE1vYmay5k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Realart Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stolen Kiss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1403611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Constance Binney","original_name":"Constance Binney","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/mYU2UMrryMKVKocwNAqC4GJhvF0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66bba55bda4ea30cb60abf4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rod La Rocque","original_name":"Rod La Rocque","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/7cmambpDRIRDQmIXPbLszOypbYr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66bba56199d16325d10e6676","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2076257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Backus","original_name":"George Backus","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":"/l2FDVX76lHGfXE2thcur5srOO0O.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66bba568e13f121fcf8238ce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bradley Barker","original_name":"Bradley Barker","popularity":0.0938,"profile_path":"/isDc11teACHpd30tQOcqqmc5N1j.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66bba56eb0d91c412a2d407c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1366132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Schable","original_name":"Robert Schable","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/uXCVTzHfVrxBKBsIhiZuIhveXw6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66bba576d728b392c8c3317d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1389019,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kathryn Stuart","original_name":"Kathryn Stuart","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bba59d942a502e570e667c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12307,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George J.
