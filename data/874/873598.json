No ordinary pair of buildings, the Twin Towers featured a unique structural design—and dozens of other technical breakthroughs—that made the then-tallest buildings in the world possible. But did these innovations contribute to their collapse on 9/11? With the help of harrowing first-hand testimonies, expert interviews, and never-before-seen graphics, and with the benefit of two decades of engineering hindsight, viewers will understand how the Towers rose…and why they fell.","popularity":0.3516,"poster_path":"/cH6QDaqBrSmHiTTHD1aQYSSYWrI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rise & Fall: The World Trade Center","video":false,"vote_average":5.75,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"D.
