Built in 1928, it will soon be a 100 year old circus. The four “Motorellos” Capt Donald Ganslmeier, El Clemente, Peter Petersen, and The Flying Dutchman are keeping the soul of these machines alive by riding The Wall Of Death to entertain hundreds of thousands of people. For them, the same passion still burns.  Shot over five years – June 2015 to August 2020 – ‘The Wall’ gives viewers a rare, in depth look into a disappearing profession and way of life. Beautiful and at times heartbreaking, we see through the expert eye of filmmaker Stéphane Gautronneau how the passion of these riders alone is what keeps the Wall Of Death alive today.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/kHh6bVXTzbmq5Gs6QSr3ThlnpfK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Capt.
