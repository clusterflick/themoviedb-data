Hands clasped behind his back, he kicks one leg up at a right angle to his body, pivots forty-five degrees, falls forward hard with a thumping noise, extends the rear leg again at a right angle behind, and begins the sequence again. As in many of his fixed-camera film and video works, parts of Nauman's body disappear from the frame as he moves close to the camera; occasionally, he walks off-screen completely while the sound of his footsteps continues on the sound tracks.","popularity":0.0443,"poster_path":"/8YMXeLC0FW65Heh9WrMBWp4DY0a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Slow Angle Walk (Beckett Walk)","title":"Slow Angle Walk (Beckett Walk)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Nauman","original_name":"Bruce Nauman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"director","credit_id":"613f348aa6ddcb008af385d2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Nauman","original_name":"Bruce Nauman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613f3ae66af9dd00917d3ec6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8YMXeLC0FW65Heh9WrMBWp4DY0a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
