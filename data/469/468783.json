Love Lingers On is based on the gothic novel Wuthering Heights and Tso shepherds Emily Brontë's tale of profound passion, thwarted love and bitter vengefulness with a perfect balance of broad narrative strokes and delicate orchestration of mise-enscene. He wisely concentrates on the lead characters' simmering mental troubles, greatly enhanced by stars Cheung Ying and Mui Yee, who overcome glaring age differences with their characters to bring life to this saga of vivid emotions.","popularity":0.178,"poster_path":"/mtPHyeQjfppwDnZh9SOQJbRSBy7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motion Picture & General Investment Co., Ltd.","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1957-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Lingers On","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Hun gui li hen tian","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Her Tragic Death","type":"Alternative English Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1669030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheung Ching","original_name":"Cheung Ching","popularity":0.1458,"profile_path":"/fEsyuhej2omj8p5sMwTt8ICWCxt.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"597e9ca99251415db1024d01","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheung Ying","original_name":"Cheung Ying","popularity":0.2352,"profile_path":"/rHdgBhRllo5kMzlmBKRInjXoxHq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"597e9cc2c3a36853f60255f5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1698147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chow Kwun-Ling","original_name":"Chow Kwun-Ling","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/gOPTBIaWgkaWSfXNrYBCHshJGG8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"597e9ccb9251415d8d023e61","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Man Lai","original_name":"Man Lai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"597e9ce39251415d8d023e81","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1331009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mui Yee","original_name":"Mui Yee","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"597e9cfec3a3685440023b1f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ng Tung","original_name":"Ng Tung","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"597e9d059251415d7802538e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1330192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wong Man-Lei","original_name":"Wong Man-Lei","popularity":0.1756,"profile_path":"/oOfxQRztyjFSIdEgdkEXedg2RFH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"597e9d0d9251415d610265d7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1877013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Hang","original_name":"Lee Hang","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"62fde8f3ab1bc70081aeb317","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1861082,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yung-Tai Lin","original_name":"Yung-Tai Lin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597e9d4dc3a368542e026083","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tso Kea","original_name":"Tso Kea","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597e9d21c3a368542e026053","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":130366,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chung Kai-Man","original_name":"Chung Kai-Man","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597e9d3b9251415d6102661b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tso Kea","original_name":"Tso Kea","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597e9d19c3a36853970275f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30224,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emily Brontë","original_name":"Emily Brontë","popularity":0.3035,"profile_path":"/oxEJAxnAcGwpHyahGrylRrz9eax.jpg","credit_id":"597e9d2ac3a3685440023b3d","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1505980,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eddie H.
