Here, in the rural silence of her aunt’s house, she is going to write her dissertation. Suddenly, two strange strangers unexpectedly appear in the house, whom Anna initially mistakes for thieves. They claim that the owner of this house yesterday rented it to them for two weeks, and for greater persuasiveness they hand over a letter in which Anya’s mother confirms this and also asks her to live with their neighbor, grandfather Gennady. This all looks very strange... And then the fantasy begins - it soon turns out that they are guests from the future, and chose this house as an intermediate station.","popularity":0.1585,"poster_path":"/wM5jDGXVn77w12LzVBzlK7Oi7bZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87650,"logo_path":"/hTF6K9qgQ7VQsD6koNupMzxUzPQ.png","name":"Leningrad Television","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kidnapping of a Wizard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Похищение чародея (ТВ)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Похищение чародея (ЛенТВ)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuri Demich","original_name":"Юрий Демич","popularity":0.2013,"profile_path":"/pLTyB9QwAcSWCBX0Cvwqa2tBUdG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kin","credit_id":"597cfbf49251415d5d006782","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anatoli Abramov","original_name":"Анатолий Абрамов","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/5Rc7MoPsoboefcjhI1taYpE8tQC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"ded Gennadiy","credit_id":"597cfc55c3a3685408006fdf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Osobik","original_name":"Владимир Особик","popularity":0.1589,"profile_path":"/owiohgT6Sc6Qo4QpdNTDQ9TxxC8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Akiplesha","credit_id":"597cfc829251415d8d006652","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Krasko","original_name":"Иван Краско","popularity":0.1647,"profile_path":"/rBvMXGQxw1IufEgy3vbtnXI6Dkt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"boyarin Roman, charodey","credit_id":"597cfcd69251415d78006ac0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4745197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anatoliy Slyasskiy","original_name":"Анатолий Слясский","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/AnHVFOYkRk6DFCbzSb5yCtpICxF.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6658c3769ef4718ae693ec5e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96496,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kir Bulychyov","original_name":"Кир Булычёв","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/8kichLl7czh6sTAHrLCY7GixeQN.jpg","credit_id":"597cfb5ac3a3685408006e7c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1860362,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gleb Selyanin","original_name":"Gleb Selyanin","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/wR6ffhHvDzDROHrd1Sp1gQm5ScL.jpg","credit_id":"597cfb3bc3a3685451006495","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1860362,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gleb Selyanin","original_name":"Gleb Selyanin","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/wR6ffhHvDzDROHrd1Sp1gQm5ScL.jpg","credit_id":"597cfb21c3a36853dd005e66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1687851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Igor Tsvetkov","original_name":"Игорь Цветков","popularity":0.0697,"profile_path":"/jwCUvYyJ0O0sratStI9o41mT9Cp.jpg","credit_id":"66db53088282baa6d7f5b605","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/wM5jDGXVn77w12LzVBzlK7Oi7bZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"телевизионный спектакль","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
