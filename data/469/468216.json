Some 500 years later, Michael Hardt, political philosopher and co-author of Empire, Multitude and Commonwealth, asks what it would mean to base a political system on love, rather than on fear. How can we transform a society that is increasingly defined by a permanent state of war and cultivated by an industry of fear? How can we realize the paradigm shift necessary to move away from a reality that depends on the exploitation of people and the cult of privatisation of public resources?","popularity":0.1212,"poster_path":"/nW8iDbv5fmycAVNo2WuXjlO7QT9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Day Words Disappear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":556160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Hardt","original_name":"Michael Hardt","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5979d596c3a368683e01139c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Karina","original_name":"Anna Karina","popularity":0.6809,"profile_path":"/oSYtIsMpV8sZD6opNrOnWsspR0D.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"(archive footage)","credit_id":"67925096405bd78b7f4709d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Constantine","original_name":"Eddie Constantine","popularity":0.2338,"profile_path":"/rhxMbjrygEvvxOKJIGiSeXntTN5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"(archive footage)","credit_id":"679250a680817cdfd4b5875d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Grimonprez","original_name":"Johan Grimonprez","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/8bsRdGhi7KcpHF8DKUG8Xa0AlRp.jpg","credit_id":"5979d55292514107d6013a56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":1036,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nW8iDbv5fmycAVNo2WuXjlO7QT9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
