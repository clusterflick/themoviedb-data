A group of young dancers, whose members are immigrants, is trying to compete in the break-dancing World Championship in Germany. The competition is the highlight of their dreams as dancers, but as we watch them prepare, we encounter a world of crisis and alienation. Mixer, 27, is supporting his family and trying to help his younger brothers, who still live with their alcoholic mom. Potter, 21, is in the army now; he still dreams of dancing, but has no one to help him care for his mother, who is ill. And yet, despite the hardships, these bold dancers confront reality head-on, because desperation is a luxury that they can hardly afford.","popularity":0.0782,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2016-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Babylon Dreamers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1859013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Shumunov","original_name":"Roman Shumunov","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5979fd9fc3a36867fd017b32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1859014,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander Plavnik","original_name":"Alexander Plavnik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5979fda8c3a36868310140f7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5832178","wikidata_id":"Q27042358","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
