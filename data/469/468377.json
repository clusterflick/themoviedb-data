Two of the most influential men in town oppose clean-up and public health efforts until their young adult children contract syphilis. Spliced into the dramatic film are segments of other educational films, including animated segments, that describe the symptoms and risks of syphilis. A butcher named Tony is excited about the birth of his first child, but the child is born dead because of a maternal syphilis infection.","popularity":0.2814,"poster_path":"/jOCmIrR7Bjb9sPBZaIaNAtlUIC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1948-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sins of the Fathers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Austin Willis","original_name":"Austin Willis","popularity":0.2367,"profile_path":"/f9hyLgx7RvvTNNbGLQrJ5EnCHF1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dr. Ben Edwards","credit_id":"60d353bd65e0a2005d0d2ff4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joy Lafleur","original_name":"Joy Lafleur","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Patsy Curran","credit_id":"60d353c3e54d5d007fe72d13","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Pratt","original_name":"John Pratt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Marty Williamson","credit_id":"60d353cd6c8492005e2cbedf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3134107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phyllis Carter","original_name":"Phyllis Carter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Daphne","credit_id":"60d353d3c9dbf90045aac413","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1780646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Avon","original_name":"Suzanne Avon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jLpTg4b1zQa4NRPZ3otmqHYNmzq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Leona","credit_id":"60d353d86c8492007eb469e4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3134141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Toupin","original_name":"Georges Toupin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Curran","credit_id":"60d363415c071b00469bd30f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Heron","original_name":"Frank Heron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Charlie Mitchell","credit_id":"60d363695c071b0073840c92","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1238006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Barclay","original_name":"Mary Barclay","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Ellen Carter","credit_id":"60d36373426ae8002e8f7286","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1716911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Rowan","original_name":"Gerald Rowan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Higgins","credit_id":"60d3638a7ef381005ea0f864","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Taviss","original_name":"Norman Taviss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Shorty","credit_id":"60d363915c071b0073840d64","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ward Bond","original_name":"Ward Bond","popularity":0.6633,"profile_path":"/6F8pPEwBHWDpX04R8LkARFejwtC.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"60d36396fe6c18005d9ef4a8","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1258804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Barclay","original_name":"Richard Barclay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"The pastor","credit_id":"60d363a49b6e470029666487","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586012,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gordon Burwash","original_name":"Gordon Burwash","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Dr. Black","credit_id":"60d363b69b6e470045cd2837","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773010,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard J.
