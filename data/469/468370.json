THE LOOM might be compared to musical quartet-form (as there are almost always four superimposed pictures); but the complexity of texture, multiplicity of tone, and the variety of interrelated rhythm, suggest symphonic dimensions. The film is very inspired by George Melies: the animals exist (in Jane's enclosure) as on a stage, their interrelationships edited to the disciplines of dance, so therefore one might say this hardly represents \"animal life on earth\"; but I would argue that this work at least epitomizes theatrical Nature, magical Creature, and is the outside limit, to date, of my art in that respect. (The balance-of-light was so perfectly realized in making the neg. of this print that I wish to credit Western Cine Lab's \"timer\" Louise Fujiki as creative collaborator in the accomplishment of this work.)","popularity":0.0493,"poster_path":"/u3F1cOQBHgmrgXT3aysQj1yWt3t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49765,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canyon Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Loom","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"597b39c9c3a3683724011053","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1859570,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Louise Fujiki","original_name":"Louise Fujiki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597b39d39251413662010d3f","department":"Editing","job":"Color Timer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0279927","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u3F1cOQBHgmrgXT3aysQj1yWt3t.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gDqRL76kzFeRpw6sFICbtCW13Ad.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Museum of Modern Art","release_date":"1987-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Production date officially listed as 1986.","release_date":"1986-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
