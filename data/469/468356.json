Figure interpreted by Stuart Sherman shines in the first part of the film by his anonymity. The man drowned in the crowd, activity, all this urban life that is foreign to him. It expresses nothing, does nothing, to the point of appearing to blur the image. In the second part, it works. Always very mysteriously. The viewer built himself a sense of all these actions cut by the film. Whatever it is, its activity is internalized: slide analysis, reading, writing. The outlines of this figure then draw, and blend back into the urban landscape, this time in the open. The character became somebody through a symbolic initiation: nighter? read de Sade? photographic activity? maybe three at a time, perhaps in a dream. The key is in becoming.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/mbVmrETPAkmRb7LCc4svCY3hmJu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1981-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hors Titre I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrice Kirchhofer","original_name":"Patrice Kirchhofer","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597b0949925141364a00cafd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mbVmrETPAkmRb7LCc4svCY3hmJu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.613,"height":1036,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sw9DwFmrClms9wpc7lACfQPM33h.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":635}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Studio 43, L'Autre Cinema","release_date":"1981-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
