In July 2016, Reynolds broadcast, via Facebook Live, the moments after the murder of her partner Philando Castile by a police officer during a traffic stop in Minnesota. Reynolds' video circulated widely online and amassed over six million views. In November 2016, with the assistance of Chisenhale Gallery, artist Luke Willis Thompson established a conversation with Reynolds, and her lawyer, and invited Reynolds to work with him on the production of an artwork. Thompson proposed to make an aesthetic response that could act as a ‘sister-image’ to Reynolds’ video broadcast. Thompson and Reynolds agreed to produce a film together, to be presented in London, and which would break with the well-known image of Reynolds, caught in a moment of violence and distributed within a constant flow of news.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/j2zDmyvZcmdmu7ddT77sY8B1so9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"autoportrait","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1859778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diamond Reynolds","original_name":"Diamond Reynolds","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"597b6f75c3a3686007007967","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1859780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Willis Thompson","original_name":"Luke Willis Thompson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597b6f99925141364e014adb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1859781,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mhairi-Claire Fitzpatrick","original_name":"Mhairi-Claire Fitzpatrick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597b7000925141364a014d37","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":789,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j2zDmyvZcmdmu7ddT77sY8B1so9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":526}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
