All his life, he has struggled to keep his head above water and now is the owner of his own pottery house and a banyan tree. His two sons Satten and Nikhil stay in the city and prefer urban life. They have no interest in their father's business and want to sell up his life's work for financial gain. The silver lining in Khirmohon's life is his granddaughter Poddo, who is an eye catching dusky beauty. They stay in their village house with another person named Boishakh, who was adopted by Khirmohon when he was just a mere child. Boishakh is a passionate character, who is loyal to Khirmohon and is more interested in keeping the pottery business afloat then Khirmohon's own sons. There is a spark between Poddo and Boishakh, but it is not expressed. The story moves forward with Boishakh trying to protect the business from going into ruins by unwanted invaders and village politics.","popularity":0.1781,"poster_path":"/uY62zBj23UwbyuGZZs7p9U9C0RO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156945,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charuneedam Audio Visual Ltd","origin_country":""},{"id":25376,"logo_path":"/qzZetTixxkc8KLc4hNGHhAIotnQ.png","name":"Impress Telefilm","origin_country":"BD"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","name":"Bangladesh"}],"release_date":"2013-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Earthen Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3138064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lutfur Rahman George","original_name":"Lutfur Rahman George","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":"/gwPzJBCUzl3A3kpQb7p4Y1wx1XZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61aa777f5907de002dd25d81","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":994338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raisul Islam Asad","original_name":"Raisul Islam Asad","popularity":0.1251,"profile_path":"/xKocsyZO7H6GEb0N4Zm5SKxCXKs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Khirmohon","credit_id":"61aa77963dc313009189c4dd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3255204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Titas Zia","original_name":"Titas Zia","popularity":0.0243,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Boishakh","credit_id":"61aa77a7d7a70a00933869c2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3334368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shormy Mala","original_name":"Shormy Mala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Poddo","credit_id":"61aa77bb1d31430067b78760","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mamunur Rashid","original_name":"Mamunur Rashid","popularity":0.1461,"profile_path":"/vX1qznTb67f3bJa3RZ6mO7aLWlu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sattar Molla","credit_id":"61aa77d43dc31300628061ee","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2036057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pijush Bandyopadhyay","original_name":"Pijush Bandyopadhyay","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Saidur Rahman","credit_id":"61aa77f12f3b17002b685ef7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1695046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wahida Mollick Jolly","original_name":"Wahida Mollick Jolly","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Satten's Wife","credit_id":"61aa7801a5743d00623d064d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akhtaruzzaman","original_name":"Akhtaruzzaman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Satten","credit_id":"61aa781185b1050063243516","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3225355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aminur Rahman Mukul","original_name":"Aminur Rahman Mukul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Nikhil","credit_id":"61aa781e7ecd2800962c77d7","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2037359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aparna Ghose","original_name":"Aparna Ghose","popularity":0.1728,"profile_path":"/iaOx2hXxN1wKAhZD3K60tud6S6U.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Fahmida","credit_id":"61b0a6411e259a0041236280","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1628423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gazi Rakayet","original_name":"Gazi Rakayet","popularity":0.0874,"profile_path":"/wUJfkHRcFgv2bvZd1g4VdmtDSW2.jpg","credit_id":"59801a8892514149440078f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5101976","wikidata_id":"Q19743653","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uY62zBj23UwbyuGZZs7p9U9C0RO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
