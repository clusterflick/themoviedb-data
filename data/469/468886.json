Oddly enough though, one of the greatest teams in state history has been lost to time—and fate. “What Carter Lost” is the saga of that team, the 1988 Dallas Carter Cowboys.  With 21 players who were offered college scholarships and several who went on to the NFL, Carter took on the best that Texas had to offer, including the Odessa Permian team that inspired Friday Night Lights, as well as the worst: in a racially charged state-wide dispute over one player’s algebra grade and Carter’s legitimacy. Somehow, the team won the championship that year. Yet not too long after, the legacy they worked so hard for was thrown away after a group of players made a terrible decision. With personal interviews with players, coaches and family members, as well as glimpses of their lives today, “What Carter Lost” is ultimately about what Carter found.","popularity":0.0466,"poster_path":"/bAJdSuVtM2NjvO1yuitFM9UCoAA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Carter Lost","video":false,"vote_average":6.938,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Hootnick","original_name":"Adam Hootnick","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597f82cc9251415dba035d22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6394186","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qkuWbFtNlRcbleqR7z7BdQzEd6Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rG4HTrjw42i59nidC33HW92JMzV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.31,"height":1295,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lM02GQB5i4XsCKUNz1UCDyzzV5P.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1697}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bAJdSuVtM2NjvO1yuitFM9UCoAA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9SwNWnTCPuzYelwssfgSCtwlzMy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1386}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Disney+","release_date":"2021-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
