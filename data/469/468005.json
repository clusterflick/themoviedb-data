Shortly after his birth, his parents are tortured to death by serf owner Wangjie. In his teens, he becomes a household serf of Wangjie, and passes an inhuman existence. Qiangba from then on refuses to speak, showing his resistance through silence. After the PLA enters Tibet, Qiangba and female serf Landuo leave to find the PLA. Landuo is rescued by the PLA, changing her fate, but Qiangba is caught and taken back. The serf owner's son, with support from foreign imperialists, foments armed rebellion. After the rebellion is smashed, Qiangba is rescued by the PLA, and the serfs are liberated at last. Qiangba is reunited with Landuo, and begins to speak again after many years of silence.","popularity":0.1216,"poster_path":"/yjUNnHGMI0MAAraN0t5whfGFP7l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39074,"logo_path":null,"name":"August 1st Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1963-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Serfs","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"农奴","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2826661,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zongjiang Huang","original_name":"Zongjiang Huang","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/9eNR3dh3bRgZqeKKqfcvjZsXWfT.jpg","credit_id":"608f10c2871b34003f987992","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2735376,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wei Linyue","original_name":"Wei Linyue","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/jCB0FuyVJ4rvz4k7tKokGt0YrBA.jpg","credit_id":"608f10d1a199a60029828bed","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1411922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Jun","original_name":"Li Jun","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":"/dHfngNhlz2LZ7JQf9sgd950PV4a.jpg","credit_id":"59eb92f5c3a3685f1b016ac7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2034747","wikidata_id":"Q2184052","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xijEXjFu4xkY5T3O8HPPeLDVPKN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.688,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A3Ec8xjeVU6h2Su32VNspQyKwE0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":516},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2700,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/yjUNnHGMI0MAAraN0t5whfGFP7l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1963-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
