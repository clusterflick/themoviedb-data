This is the image seen at the opening of the film. Subsequent sections of the film present to the viewer differing juxtapositions of the four segments of this image which are created by the cross-bars of the window. Tensions are created between what we expect to see, and what we do see. We see the original image as a single whole.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/j81AG4EXZXKM7RNcwmWU90qjHUm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1976-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Windowframe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1861745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Hewins","original_name":"Roger Hewins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"597fc2adc3a3681039000dbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8291824","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j81AG4EXZXKM7RNcwmWU90qjHUm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
