In an era when many musicians were emulating Charlie Parker’s drug abuse, Brown inspired others to achieve greatness while living a clean life. Ironically, he was killed in a car accident at the age of 25.  This feature-length documentary presents a richly detailed account of Brown’s life, and examines his historical importance in the context of three criteria–innovation, influence, and individuality.","popularity":0.6653,"poster_path":"/zV9ajpGoa3hqgFOQdAUZuxiiFM1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92889,"logo_path":null,"name":"Glanden Productions
