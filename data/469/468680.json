With modern day interviews and archival footage, the documentary discloses the personal struggles and triumphs that classic Afro-Italian, African-American and Afro-descendant actors faced in the Italian film industry, while mirroring their struggles with those of contemporary actors who are working diligently to find respectable, significant, and non-stereotypical roles, but are often unable to do so. Blaxploitalian is more than an unveiling of a troubled history; it is a call-to-action for increased diversity in international cinema through the stories of these artists in an effort to reflect the modern and racially diverse Italy.","popularity":0.7329,"poster_path":"/qCcEFJI0Gj4FehOLF5Hv5J2HgFY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44632,"logo_path":"/neCKH4sJCBhZ1B4QocTM4VXCQOR.png","name":"Gravitas
