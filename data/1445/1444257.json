After the Decembrist revolt of 1825, Pouschin was exiled to Siberia. Poushkin, on the other hand, was allowed to return from exile and became a supporter of the Tsar. But the two friends remained spiritually close. Writing from across thousands of miles, Poushkin reached out to Pouschin and his other former classmates. \"May God help you, my friends /In times of storm and grief /In far off lands, in empty seas /And in the somber caverns of the earth.\" The historian Nathan Eidelman brilliantly describes the lives and friendship of these remarkable men. The film also includes recitals of Poushkin's poetry by the famous dramatic actress, Alla Demidova.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":60038,"logo_path":"/wlwwFT1T3byi98Ud51ZbIVCIjwC.png","name":"Central Television USSR","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1980-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pushkin and Pushchin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389532,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nathan Edelman","original_name":"Nathan Edelman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67ca296df708440336cb4563","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alla Demidova","original_name":"Алла Демидова","popularity":0.2634,"profile_path":"/lHvrZsCeNFUiu21ZAAC0XJynuQX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67ca297830f4444c6b2b374b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Goldovskaya","original_name":"Marina Goldovskaya","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/xCQuw54l9JsCpx5AjXNGPqGi8bZ.jpg","credit_id":"67ca299030f4444c6b2b3754","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389532,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nathan Edelman","original_name":"Nathan Edelman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ca29a8f708440336cb4585","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Goldovskaya","original_name":"Marina Goldovskaya","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/xCQuw54l9JsCpx5AjXNGPqGi8bZ.jpg","credit_id":"67ca29b236598226a1afc329","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4387958,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marina Krutoyarskaya","original_name":"Марианна Крутоярская","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ca29bd36598226a1afc330","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0244724","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
