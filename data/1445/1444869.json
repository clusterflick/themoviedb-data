Pushed to quickly assimilate and become American by their adoptive parents, the girls' life and family back in Korea soon become a distant past.  Thirteen years later, the sisters return to their go-hyang or homeland to reunite with their birth parents and two younger brothers. No longer able to speak the same language, and almost strangers with each other, the girls attempt to reconnect with their family and find out the truth about their adoption. Searching for Go-hyang is about the decisions we are sometimes forced to make, as well as the contradictions and reconciliations in our lives.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching for Gohyang","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3100051,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tammy Chu Tolle","original_name":"Tammy Chu Tolle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cbb6d442c7521252f5942f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
