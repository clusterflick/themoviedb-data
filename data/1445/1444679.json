This film explores Scriabin’s profound vision of art's unity — where music, movement, light and colour merge to create transcendent experiences. Some claim Scriabin pioneered atonality before Schoenberg. Key works: Poème, Op. 32 No. 1 (1903) and Vers la flamme, Op. 72 (1914). Featuring commentary from esteemed musicians like Eduard Artemyev, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Vladimir Horowitz, Artist: Hermann Nitsch, conductor Mikhail Pletnev and insights from Scriabin’s daughter: Marina Scriabine, this documentary offers a unique glimpse into the life and works of one of music’s most enigmatic figures. Shot across stunning locales in Switzerland, Italy and Russia, enriched with Scriabin’s own writings and rare archival materials. The highlight includes a historic recording of Scriabin himself, playing his Poem Op. 32 No. 1 on a Welte Mignon player-piano, recorded in 1908.","popularity":0.2707,"poster_path":"/1crEAEwolN73pGpREHCLU1iM82D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1996-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alexander Scriabin – Towards the Light / Calculation and Ecstasy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Dem Licht entgegen – Alexander Skrjabin: Kalkül und Ekstase","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Nitsch","original_name":"Hermann Nitsch","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cb37a68230b256f4f57951","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Horowitz","original_name":"Vladimir Horowitz","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/lAHDf4PWlYXeV38qYRLunm3yEXc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cb37b9a4df97db964f5af0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Ashkenazy","original_name":"Vladimir Ashkenazy","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":"/wgESY3384x00YZgyopCEt05695T.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cb37d07c70c42a034f59fa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3350538,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander Scriabin","original_name":"Александр Скрябин","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mT7k1u8X8WRfQaJpOTPKmnxrtj1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cb37e87c967e04d55b8395","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2261744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Pletnev","original_name":"Mikhail Pletnev","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lOdX948dF2mWuxQHWqnJhaRvTK3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cb3b0f8230b256f4f579a8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72304,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sergei Rachmaninoff","original_name":"Sergei Rachmaninoff","popularity":0.1739,"profile_path":"/1IPEDGeCj6iJf5UEDS7ciN1mIw.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cb3c158230b256f4f57a0a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5289436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Wyschnegradsky","original_name":"Ivan Wyschnegradsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cb3cb58230b256f4f57a3b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":560802,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eduard Artemyev","original_name":"Эдуард Артемьев","popularity":0.1904,"profile_path":"/y6VkMfxIpuiP8RmWCFO52ev4r2T.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cf8bab434c98c8ec810bb6","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608905,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oliver Becker","original_name":"Oliver Becker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cb3806f8e1f1bc90f57af0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1crEAEwolN73pGpREHCLU1iM82D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":236667,"name":"classical"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"},{"id":267007,"name":"russian"},{"id":302872,"name":"avantgarde"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Alexander Scriabin – Towards the Light / Calculation and Ecstasy (1996)","key":"E2VmLkzzBMM","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-05-24T15:30:01.000Z","id":"67cb399ee9461adf414f5ac9"}]}}}
