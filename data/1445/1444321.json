Learn how to protect yourself and your friends from this happening to you.  Sam Spady had a wonderful life. She had loving parents and adoring friends. She was a homecoming queen and class president. She had looks, brains, youth and promise.  She had everything to live for.  But all that came to a sudden and horrific end in the summer of 2004 when Sam shared too many shots of vanilla flavored vodka, passed out and died alone inside a cluttered fraternity house.  Her death was an unintended tragedy.  Binge drinking kills nearly 2,000 college students each year. The epidemic is growing at high schools, colleges and universities across the nation. We hope kids, parents, families and friends will watch Samâ€™s story, learn her lesson and know when to say no.","popularity":0.3092,"poster_path":"/lqhTAtMkXr0p8TLROznYZ8KgbFp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of a beautiful small town girl whose life ended too soon.","title":"Death by Alcohol - The Sam Spady Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5287870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Spady","original_name":"Rick Spady","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ca5e0af708440336cb4f45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5287872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patty Spady","original_name":"Patty Spady","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ca5e2d7479d8c8492b3efa","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1425,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lqhTAtMkXr0p8TLROznYZ8KgbFp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":993}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":567,"name":"alcohol"},{"id":197110,"name":"teenage mortality"},{"id":211044,"name":"alcohol problems"},{"id":213120,"name":"teen social issues"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
