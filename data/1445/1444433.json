Faced with rejection from his family, he struggles to find balance between his need for acceptance and his desire to live authentically. To achieve the life he dreams of, Mikołaj must reconcile with his father, Piotr, who cannot accept his son’s gender identity. At the same time, he faces the challenges of youth—first job, first love, first parties—alongside the Kafkaesque judicial system that refuses to recognize his identity. With sensitivity and intensity, the film traces Mikołaj’s inner path and his struggle to bridge the gap between himself and his father. Will they find common ground, or will the challenges they face drive them further apart?","popularity":0.1012,"poster_path":"/aRhLWY5UUrfjFmevGdfh9xrqnRW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":255528,"logo_path":null,"name":"King House","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":255531,"logo_path":null,"name":"Njupixel","origin_country":""},{"id":255532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frydrych&Zdanowski","origin_country":""},{"id":255533,"logo_path":null,"name":"Meme Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":254444,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Fonograf","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2024-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Being Mikolaj","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549733,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aurelia Frydrych-Zdanowska","original_name":"Aurelia Frydrych-Zdanowska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67caaccfaa523c748a2b4bea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549733,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aurelia Frydrych-Zdanowska","original_name":"Aurelia Frydrych-Zdanowska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67caae30dba14916062b4b84","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549733,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aurelia Frydrych-Zdanowska","original_name":"Aurelia Frydrych-Zdanowska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67caae3bdba14916062b4b87","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pawel J.M.
