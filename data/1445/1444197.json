Snaketown in Arizona is dated by some scholars to around 300 BCE., The site of Snaketown is positioned on the Gila River Basin near Phoenix AZ at the Gila River Indian Community. Both the Hohokam and the Ootam peoples have occupied the land and from what I gather there is some contention on who did what when. Isn't their always. This is a really great film on the excavation of Snaketown and is a valuable educational resource I am fortunate to have. The Pima Indian father of Ira Hayes makes an appearance.","popularity":0.0889,"poster_path":"/gdSvlorOSIcxdnuKUtw1pS4AOIi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187041,"logo_path":null,"name":"University Of California Extension Media Center","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"1969, SNAKETOWN, GILA RIVER INDIAN COMMUNITY, ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXCAVATION","title":"Snaketown- Early Indian Farmers Conquer the Arizona Desert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5287279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emil Walter","original_name":"Emil Walter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67ca0410aa523c748a2b3275","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gdSvlorOSIcxdnuKUtw1pS4AOIi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":294531,"name":"documentary film"},{"id":308477,"name":"archaeology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
