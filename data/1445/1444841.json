Yamalakis was a sensitive filmmaker whose oeuvre is still largely unfamiliar to the inquiring viewer. His camera wanders around Ios in the summer of 1976, freely, almost associatively recording aspects of a Greek island perched on the cusp between a traditional, pre-modern world and a sweeping shift in mores. Therein lies the absurd, bitter comicality of this perceptive portrayal of the island’s microsociety, which covers everyone: grotesque local dignitaries, storytelling taverna jokesters, cunning small shopkeepers, naïve tourists, young women crushed by the small-mindedness of provincial life. All are woven together in the most effortless, tenderest way, crafting a kaleidoscopic portrait of the Greek archipelago, timeless in its conception and power.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On a Little Greek Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3822533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matheo Yamalakis","original_name":"Matheo Yamalakis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cb908305adfb9eb95b94a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3822533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matheo Yamalakis","original_name":"Matheo Yamalakis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cb90a605adfb9eb95b94b7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3822533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matheo Yamalakis","original_name":"Matheo Yamalakis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cb90be05adfb9eb95b94c0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
