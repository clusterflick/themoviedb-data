Featuring new orchestral arrangements of his iconic hits, including Rhinestone Cowboy, Southern Nights, By the Time I Get to Phoenix, Wichita Lineman, and Galveston, the concert also includes a stunning Beach Boys medley, a nod to Campbell's time as Brian Wilson’s tour replacement in 1965. As a special treat, Jimmy Webb—who wrote Phoenix, Wichita Lineman, and Galveston—joins Campbell on stage, creating an unforgettable performance filled with pure musical bliss.","popularity":0.3618,"poster_path":"/qYBIDVMlgdDxeeAGo8AM9zskOv4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1977-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Evening with Glen Campbell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glen Campbell","original_name":"Glen Campbell","popularity":0.5469,"profile_path":"/kBd4JGVWRjSVEjHsnqe77OVDEEA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67cac5b554783caaa3afdaf3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15178,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jimmy Webb","original_name":"Jimmy Webb","popularity":0.1129,"profile_path":"/18Jum4p1eAmZKyn7Z4qzcBSqdS6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self / Special Guest","credit_id":"67caca68dcc9c03ff0cb6079","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3729123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra","original_name":"Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"67cad67cdba14916062b52dd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632642,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alyn Ainsworth","original_name":"Alyn Ainsworth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self / Musical Director","credit_id":"67cad696a001960f78cb65e2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5288584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Griffiths","original_name":"Barry Griffiths","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self / Leader of the R.P.O.","credit_id":"67cad6b71f9ef3532dafd320","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2395089,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"T.J.
