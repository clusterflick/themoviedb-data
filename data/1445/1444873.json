His father is assumed to be a U.S. military man who had visited Korea during the Korean War, and his mother was Korean. He was abandoned by his Korean mom when he was four or five years old after his father disappeared. He had lived homeless until he was brought to an orphanage and adopted to the Clement family from Charlotte, North Carolina in 1958. He ended up running his own multi-million dollar medical device company. He is also helping Korean adoptees all over the world. He is the product of his own positive imagination in spite of his dark childhood.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Journey of a Korean War orphan","title":"Where are you going, Thomas?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5290042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Clement","original_name":"Thomas Clement","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cbb9389a3f7013fa4f6a69","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5290041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jackie Choi","original_name":"Jackie Choi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cbb9129a3f7013fa4f6a4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7115280","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Macon Film Festival","release_date":"2023-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
