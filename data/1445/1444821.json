We follow the elder entertainer as he has a brush with death and a chance encounter with a beautiful visitor that will change both their lives forever.  The movie feels almost like a documentary with elements of structured improvisation, one-take scenes, and real locations. It's a really good indie production.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magic Hour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
