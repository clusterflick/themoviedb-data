He was allowed the impossible: to be a satirist. Even during the height of government approved Anti-Semitism, Raikin was a figure to be reckoned with. He was known and beloved by all, his razor-sharp wit admired - and feared. In fact, president Putin met his future wife at a Raikin show. The film follows Raikin to his shows, on stage, and backstage, during rehearsals, at rest, and during conversations with his friends, including legendary Soviet jazz singer Leonid Utesov, film director Yuli Raizman, the poet Bella Ahmadullina, and the American film director George Kukor.","popularity":0.3243,"poster_path":"/bmSEY0oaOU6GoK6RhK3FdkeJF33.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6608,"logo_path":"/eALlDyTQSw5rLU1IJvYps4himcU.png","name":"Ekran","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet
