In the checking room, first, the contrast material is injected into his body, as every year. But this time, the examiner is shocked, when she realizes, Kristóf is a problematic 21. This happiness level barely exceeds the critical minimum limit. If he goes below 20, he has to be reported to the authorities. On his way out, he bumps into his ex-girlfriend, who surprisingly doesn't hide the number on the neck. She is a proud 80. Seeing her happy, Kristóf starts to realize, maybe he was wrong to break up with her. Maybe, they could be happy again... together.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/f7qLDhX4hkV6aYBoPKZBfMtWAQu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3556226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Balázs Budavári","original_name":"Balázs Budavári","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c9b918bd7861478b24c3e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":819,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f7qLDhX4hkV6aYBoPKZBfMtWAQu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
