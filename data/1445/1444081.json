Although construction began in 1225, the cathedral remains unfinished today after braving numerous structural alterations and disasters. Ambitiously designed as the largest church in Europe, it enjoyed a brief stint as the world’s tallest building from 1569 through 1573. At 157 feet high, its choir is still unsurpassed.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Architecture of Transcendence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5286819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Greenberg","original_name":"Richard Greenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c9c4fd6fb40013920d00d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31795289","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
