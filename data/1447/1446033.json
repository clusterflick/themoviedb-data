As they confront their respective pains, their journey of discovering faint sprouts of hope in hearts as parched as summer sand is depicted—a poignant yet tender masterpiece where sorrow and warmth intertwine.","popularity":0.8831,"poster_path":"/uaf0YESIQjTSkNKRyvJONOcq9Ih.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2928,"logo_path":null,"name":"stylejam","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3033,"logo_path":"/AwgX2FHGJd54aSWfWJqptFvT1h.png","name":"Asmik Ace","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":97940,"logo_path":"/kOF6C4l0WZNqRjUjfgKKegx3sA3.png","name":"BBB","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2025-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"夏の砂の上","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Odagiri","original_name":"オダギリジョー","popularity":0.6629,"profile_path":"/jjbwOodtQeVcTwO9oUbLOGjjHDP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Osamu Koura","credit_id":"67cebeadf9a48698e2e30516","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3144130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akari Takaishi","original_name":"髙石あかり","popularity":0.6242,"profile_path":"/qQURz3QiOVFHOo2azpL5cQOJg3a.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Yuko","credit_id":"67cebeec2794b0d5982ab9fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":111690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takako Matsu","original_name":"松たか子","popularity":0.7501,"profile_path":"/9AMpsOM4cAUUmOnrz8ucX4ZHXOJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Keiko Koura","credit_id":"67cebf123c25444882e31026","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2595778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naotaro Moriyama","original_name":"森山直太朗","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67cec068ff1a840b99111a66","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2389740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fumiya Takahashi","original_name":"高橋文哉","popularity":2.5817,"profile_path":"/l7f30v8ew2bjKWBCaf3WGoU54xC.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67cec2086676e9940010e6be","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1407396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yukiko Shinohara","original_name":"篠原友希子","popularity":0.4181,"profile_path":"/3797As8HURRMWtGb02ogLyIxR56.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"67cec21b2794b0d5982abbaf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hikari Mitsushima","original_name":"満島ひかり","popularity":2.5942,"profile_path":"/q5kylGVbGk2a8iD4omtQAuyqbxV.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67cec0a63c25444882e310a4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Mitsuishi","original_name":"光石研","popularity":1.3541,"profile_path":"/6MQodqe4Sc7Ga1R7FhiOl1msJ26.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67cec0712794b0d5982abb14","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2221051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinya Tamada","original_name":"玉田真也","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":"/zxpk7OOBRuFAtpV9lX6RCVIiPG4.jpg","credit_id":"67cebf276676e9940010e434","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2221051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinya Tamada","original_name":"玉田真也","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":"/zxpk7OOBRuFAtpV9lX6RCVIiPG4.jpg","credit_id":"67cebf2f2794b0d5982aba36","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043272,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Masataka Matsuda","original_name":"Masataka Matsuda","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cebf756676e9940010e4bf","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"natsusuna_movie"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uaf0YESIQjTSkNKRyvJONOcq9Ih.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10181,"name":"based on play or musical"},{"id":189140,"name":"based on opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
