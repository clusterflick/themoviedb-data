Every mile of his journey brings fresh memories of events from the life of Jesus, whose followers he, Saul, is seeking to destroy. Little does he know it, but the journey is to change his life, his name, and world history forever!  The greatest opponent of the faith is to become Paul, its greatest defender. We see him flinging wide the door of the faith to the whole world!","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/25wuSdztBEgveUcAV2fxlovtaZY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paul’s Road to Damascus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1722585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Nunn","original_name":"David Nunn","popularity":0.1067,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cfa032434c98c8ec8111ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/25wuSdztBEgveUcAV2fxlovtaZY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":704}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
