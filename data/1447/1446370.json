She takes us into the lives and relationship histories of her black, female patients to find out what social factors are putting them at risk. When she expands her research to include women across boundaries of race, class and country, she discovers a dangerous power imbalance that all heterosexual women face in the bedroom, but rarely discuss. ALL OF US is about HIV/AIDS but it is not a tragedy. It is a story of resilience, courage and activism.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love and sex can mean life of death","title":"All of Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0826579","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
