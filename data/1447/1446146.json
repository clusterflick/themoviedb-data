The band was recording images with a handycam, material with which they shaped this documentary in 2007. In its 70 minutes of black and white footage, one can enter into the sensations of a rock band on the road, see the curious recording of the album (outside of a conventional studio, in a farmhouse in Eraso) and its subsequent mixing in Kansas (USA)... In addition to the members of BTX, you can also see testimonies of Marino Goñi (GOR DISCOS), Karlos Osinaga (Lisabö), Tim McIlrath (Rise Against), Ryan Pope (The Get Up Kids), Ed Rose (Black Lodge Studios), etc. can be seen.  The documentary was screened at several film festivals such as the Portobello Film Festival in England or the Zinemastea in Gasteiz.","popularity":0.1162,"poster_path":"/iKtgOaNq9Xwi8x7khitehGNSmoG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172468,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berri Txarrak","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2008-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zertarako Amestu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2327577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gorka Urbizu","original_name":"Gorka Urbizu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cf01a1d95e411dd02a838c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2946359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marino Goñi","original_name":"Marino Goñi","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cf01b2856e13cb3d113341","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5295018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karlos Osinaga","original_name":"Karlos Osinaga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cf01bfd95e411dd02a8398","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1588372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim McIlrath","original_name":"Tim McIlrath","popularity":0.1181,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cf01c92794b0d5982acc62","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Pope","original_name":"Ryan Pope","popularity":1.2695,"profile_path":"/wK9BhIYWrspsJPZEGhTiuv7Zht7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cf01d48d0c44cf8f113041","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5295021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Rose","original_name":"Ed Rose","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67cf01e505da1a9e15e2d8bf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5295024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikel López","original_name":"Mikel López","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67cf0207856e13cb3d11336d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4134510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aitor Goikoetxea","original_name":"Aitor Goikoetxea","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67cf02103c25444882e3231e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5295033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose Luis Otamendi","original_name":"Jose Luis Otamendi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67cf025c05da1a9e15e2d90c","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5295029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ibon A.
