The unique edit-form of Confluence weaves these streams of movement together like notes in a musical score. Events are broken loose from their normal flow and organized into autonomous clusters. The result is a transformation of the recorded world, and its projection into a new temporal matrix. The tunnel of time becomes porous; crisscrossed by passageways and escape routes. 14:00 minutes.  \". . . an exotic m√©lange of visual and audio rhythms.\" - John Columbus, Director, Black Maria Film & Video Festival  \"In Confluence, McElwee jumps from one location to the next as if merging into an altered state\" - TL Reid, Afterimage","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/1Dy8NBu6H6kSBEZNnedo9sBoPxu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Confluence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van McElwee","original_name":"Van McElwee","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5kucYiJ9HWOT0tAtdSBbG3MJIfh.jpg","credit_id":"67d0f2f327c3960c2d1e1168","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1371,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Dy8NBu6H6kSBEZNnedo9sBoPxu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":914}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
