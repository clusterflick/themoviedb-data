This film not only marks the break of a long hiatus from YouTube/filmmaking for me, but it is also the first film I have produced independently. I wrote the script a few weeks ago and began shooting shortly after.  I'd like to give a HUGE thank you to everyone who left their touch on this film. I would not have been able to make this without the support and commitment from you, and I especially would not have been able to make this at this level of quality without you. Thank you.  Thank you for watching!
