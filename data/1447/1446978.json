Directors Lou Deinhart, Evi Rohde, and Zoë Struif incorporate 1980s/90s theatre productions, news footage, and protest recordings into their research. Alternating between present-day encounters and historical media, they interview numerous witnesses, constructing a collage of diverse memories rather than a single narrative, highlighting grassroots movements' struggles, solidarity, and impact.","popularity":0.3765,"poster_path":"/yW16lqonnS2AdW4kehy66KKNMB6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Uneinsichtigen - Aids-Aktivismus in Frankfurt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5298654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lou Deinhart","original_name":"Lou Deinhart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d0f4b927c3960c2d1e11ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5298655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evi Rohde","original_name":"Evi Rohde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d0f4c613990a058b60a66b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5298657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoë Struif","original_name":"Zoë Struif","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d0f4cf434c98c8ec81571e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5298654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lou Deinhart","original_name":"Lou Deinhart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d0f4e213990a058b60a67b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5298655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evi Rohde","original_name":"Evi Rohde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d0f4ef86fea60ab81e0dd7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5298657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoë Struif","original_name":"Zoë Struif","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d0f4f986fea60ab81e0ddd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34691781","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/yW16lqonnS2AdW4kehy66KKNMB6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":740,"name":"aids"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":213971,"name":"activism"},{"id":332780,"name":"frankfurt, germany"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Frankfurt","release_date":"2024-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Internationales Frauenfilmfestival","release_date":"2025-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
