They share with us fragments of their lives before and after incarceration. These fragments explore turning points in the lives of our collaborators, beginning in childhood, that, when viewed from the perspective of the present, create a direct line to the events that lead to system involvement. Other segments of our piece make evident the remorse felt by those who have done harm and the redemption they seek. The piece delves into the challenges of “coming home” and the effort it takes to survive “on the outside.” The piece is a tribute to the resilience, compassion, and generosity of those whose stories make up the devised text. And finally, the piece, and the process that created it, is an example of the kinds of communities that the arts can create at almost any age—communities where self-realization, shared goals and transformation are made possible.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/24Z15wEVt3i6LCaAYv765Gkhxyr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":255921,"logo_path":null,"name":"Well Said
