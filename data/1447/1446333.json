In September 2021, Tuni's half-brother took his own life, and her mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Because of the difficult circumstances, Tuni finds it challenging to talk about her feelings. Shortly after her brother passed, she got a dog named Salto. It didn't take long before Salto became her best friend - she even let him sleep in her bed. Tuni understands that time is precious, so she creates a bucket list of things she wants to accomplish. She wants to dance in the rain, sell pearls with friends, and teach Salto not to bark so they can go on vacation. At the bottom of the list is something that requires extra courage - visiting her older brother Håkon's grave.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salto, Pus og den døde fisken","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36041826","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
