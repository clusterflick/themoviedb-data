His employer, Madame Felice, sells the gown to Mrs. Mortimer Reyton, a middle-aged woman who is gradually losing the love of her husband. The gown so transforms her that, in honor of their wedding anniversary, Reyton buys three ambulances for France. Mrs. Reyton then sends the gown to her cousin Natalie. The garment so inspires Englishman Neil Cunningham that, to win Natalie's love, he returns home to enlist. In France, Neil proves himself a hero and, while leading an attack on a German stronghold, saves Andre's father, the mayor of the town, from death. Thus, the gown made a reality of Andre's dream to serve his country.","popularity":0.1534,"poster_path":"/h3K5X9gGcSUYECQGVYCGOXGSeni.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gown Of Destiny","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma Rubens","original_name":"Alma Rubens","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/5E4uO4iO6cw0FsOL2oUcytqM1XN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d578f8f4bc38b60d4259f3d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2388941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herrera Tejedde","original_name":"Herrera Tejedde","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d578f954bc38b19542745ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Sears","original_name":"Allan Sears","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":"/yFsG56zHqVdlA5gVGpZqYd1Oxiy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d578f9a4bc38b35032773e1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian West","original_name":"Lillian West","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/A3ntTVkN6oCH6D173hlAhULMtQZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d578f9fe8131d7200893196","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
