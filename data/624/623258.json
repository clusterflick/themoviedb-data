Swann re-filmed the sequences frame by frame on Super-8, creating a three screen semi-abstracted, colour-saturated triptych. The images depict men and women in ambiguous situations of embrace or violence, creating a frieze of charged scenes whose effect is heightened by overlaying the original soundtracks with the wailing of police sirens and other sound effects.\" - Sotiris Kyriacou","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/affy1V8jIb9dkrBTxO76OZ6Waxv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passion Triptych","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cordelia Swann","original_name":"Cordelia Swann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d544bc3e18b9727f0d2ae76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387193,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jim Divers","original_name":"Jim Divers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d544d8f55c92600152579ea","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2879,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/affy1V8jIb9dkrBTxO76OZ6Waxv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1922}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
