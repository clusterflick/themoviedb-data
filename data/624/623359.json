In addition to living in the shadow of Count Dracula's fame, Ysefer has just been bought at an auction by an Internet woman. Not only bought, humiliated, but also sent to a strange world called Brazil, more precisely to Avenida Paulista, in São Paulo. After night falls, Ysefer emerges from her coffin to find Misti nearby, living with a woman named Augusta. The vampire will not rest until he finds his beloved-hated sorceress, even if for that he needs to join the strangest beings of the night in São Paulo.","popularity":0.1119,"poster_path":"/psMDgEKhCV7FuujVXTlCFQMz3dd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105386,"logo_path":"/9ZUWfLhM4g7KgG8Tk2VaezGeBJs.png","name":"Medialand","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Filme B: O Vampiro da Paulista","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodrigo Miallaret","original_name":"Rodrigo Miallaret","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Conde Ysefer","credit_id":"5d54cfd1e8131d0013894472","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2387532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejandra Sampaio","original_name":"Alejandra Sampaio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fada","credit_id":"5d54cff9e8131d00158943c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Paula Lopez","original_name":"Ana Paula Lopez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bate Bola Jogo Rápido","credit_id":"5d54d023bc865700132be817","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Mendes","original_name":"André Mendes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Vendedor de Arte Estranha","credit_id":"5d54d0434bc38b6114240d39","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2204227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Júlio Oliveira","original_name":"Júlio Oliveira","popularity":0.1046,"profile_path":"/2Q2DOufMRQZ7JoOhYCm0Mwl7PQl.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"632571a3f14dad007b790a92","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carla Albuquerque","original_name":"Carla Albuquerque","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":"/mOE5W4aZyUNE1AOnC9cDf7Ly7DF.jpg","credit_id":"5f010584f031740039570052","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2084856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beto Ribeiro","original_name":"Beto Ribeiro","popularity":0.1249,"profile_path":"/kU7QmKp5QwBko06N3DvniefYjhV.jpg","credit_id":"5f01058ff0317400365a6e84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2084856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beto Ribeiro","original_name":"Beto Ribeiro","popularity":0.1249,"profile_path":"/kU7QmKp5QwBko06N3DvniefYjhV.jpg","credit_id":"5f010598f031740039570075","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6819028","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xsJ7fRh5gaYeRvyAUnIUFxK0Hl7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/psMDgEKhCV7FuujVXTlCFQMz3dd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3133,"name":"vampire"},{"id":4553,"name":"black humor"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
