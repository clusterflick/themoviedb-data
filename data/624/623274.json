An ordinary working man from Blackburn, George was charged with High Treason, shortly after The Peterloo Massacre in August 1819, for speaking at a gathering of workers in Burnley.  Narrated by one of George's descendants, 8-year-old Monty Speed, this beautiful animated montage depicts events in George's life in the year 1819, following a quest by descendants to uncover his grave and raise awareness of his story.","popularity":0.1449,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Radical","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387238,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Beth Joy","original_name":"Beth Joy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d545c6ac144dd00154c0e8d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387253,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emma Speed","original_name":"Emma Speed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d545dd0ea37e00015849ba5","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387256,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Monty Speed","original_name":"Monty Speed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d545de9c144dd00174c1034","department":"Sound","job":"Vocals"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
