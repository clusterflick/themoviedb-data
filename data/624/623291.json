Robert Cordier’s movie about medicine and the body made 20,000 faint at the Montreal world’s fair. Ghost Artist unmasks it as an avant-garde work for the masses inspired by collaborations with legendary artists like James Baldwin, Andy Warhol, Allen Ginsberg, Jean Genet and Salvador Dalí.  Ghost Artist is in the same documentary family as Searching for Sugarman and Finding Vivien Maier.","popularity":0.1515,"poster_path":"/fhT3LOUVSTzc25rkYBNiEqUc4N3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96273,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rink Rat Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost Artist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234576,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edward Riche","original_name":"Edward Riche","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d54637db76cbb0015d82be4","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Palmer","original_name":"Steven Palmer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d546391a135330013fb2994","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234576,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edward Riche","original_name":"Edward Riche","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f5957deb68a8993ee575a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Palmer","original_name":"Steven Palmer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f59588eb68a8993ee575bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907599,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mary Sexton","original_name":"Mary Sexton","popularity":0.0619,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f59596eb68a8993ee575c7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Palmer","original_name":"Steven Palmer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f5959d4e2d687421d5cbd8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4964548,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Mooney","original_name":"Chris Mooney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f595adeb68a8993ee575d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2027190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrico Alexander Giordano","original_name":"Enrico Alexander Giordano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f595c3efcc0ae90dbed731","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Simms","original_name":"Justin Simms","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f595cdefcc0ae90dbed744","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4964549,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jim Vivian","original_name":"Jim Vivian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f595ffbe32643d54bed63b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4964551,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Billard","original_name":"Michael Billard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f596194e2d687421d5cc3c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4964552,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ron Leary","original_name":"Ron Leary","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f5962defcc0ae90dbed794","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21662152","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fhT3LOUVSTzc25rkYBNiEqUc4N3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":939}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"FIN AIFF 2019","release_date":"2019-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ghost Artist Trailer","key":"301863009","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-11-20T15:16:30.000Z","id":"66f596784e2d687421d5cc7f"}]}}}
