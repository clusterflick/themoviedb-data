Her \"protector\" is stabbed to death by Giulia's hot-headed musician lover Tony (Francis McDonald), whereupon the heroine takes refuge in the villa of French playwright La Farge. Under La Farge's careful tutelage, Giulia develops into a famous actress, capturing the heart of the Duke De Chaumont. Though LaFarge himself has fallen in love with the girl, he does not stand in her way when she accepts the Duke's proposal. But Giulia has not reckoned with Tony, who is still crazy about her and still willing to kill any man who stands in his way. Tony murders LaFarge, then sets his sights on the Duke, intending to kill the poor fellow during the wedding ceremony. Hoping to save the Duke's life, Giulia pretends to have fallen out of love with him and returns to Tony.","popularity":0.1818,"poster_path":"/kxM9F3lQmCC5JXrCCWZfy0VmhWW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ghost Flower","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma Rubens","original_name":"Alma Rubens","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/5E4uO4iO6cw0FsOL2oUcytqM1XN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d558c5e4bc38b717124e9cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles West","original_name":"Charles West","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/b83aIQMnrWmXxnYm5vbPI1izN7u.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d558c644bc38b195424965e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis McDonald","original_name":"Francis McDonald","popularity":0.2683,"profile_path":"/5sIApbjJvZx0KvEDEk7BWKUuAeg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d558c70bc86574b372c620f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Rosson","original_name":"Richard Rosson","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/hjJhqwxMpdVpj5C9yfmM0H4MvgD.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5d558c764bc38b717124e9df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1023434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emory Johnson","original_name":"Emory Johnson","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/bhjxPzKIyVslP87KkDyDpUJoTks.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5d558c7ee8131d3e2789bff7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naida Lessing","original_name":"Naida Lessing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5d558c85bc86574b362c64f9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tote Du Crow","original_name":"Tote Du Crow","popularity":0.1032,"profile_path":"/3ner14tlYvEaHu92UdxxyiCSHRV.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5d558c8dbc86574b362c64fe","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Borzage","original_name":"Frank Borzage","popularity":0.2085,"profile_path":"/ban01OL4OFBDHsWkq4lEPWEtzbi.jpg","credit_id":"5d558c25e8131d3e3489bc0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2115667,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Catherine Carr","original_name":"Catherine Carr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d558c2f4bc38b1954249635","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2362759,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Madeline Matzen","original_name":"Madeline Matzen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d558c39e8131d3e2789bfbb","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106106,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jack MacKenzie","original_name":"Jack MacKenzie","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d558c45bc86574a032c8402","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0009103","wikidata_id":"Q3521024","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kxM9F3lQmCC5JXrCCWZfy0VmhWW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1918-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
