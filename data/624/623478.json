How does it influence family and friendship ties? How does it affect the body, mind and spirit of veterans? These are some of the questions approached in this documentary, whose background is the trajectory of the men from the III Batalhão do 6º Regimento de Infantaria [3rd Battalion of the 6th Infantry Regiment] - \"Navalha\" [\"Switchblade\"] -, of the Força Expedicionária Brasileira (FEB) [Brazilian Expeditionary Force], as well as the battles they fought in the Gothic Line, raised by the Axis armies in Italy, during World War II. The guiding thread of the narrative follows the statements of twenty interviewees, chosen among former combatants and historians. Based on the eyewitness account of soldiers who lived the horror of war, the work dives into the Brazilian soul, values, beliefs, singularities, virtues and flaws in the face of the other peoples involved in the conflict.","popularity":0.1262,"poster_path":"/qMquKcJerAlXkzqEB1Yi0dURWED.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Navalha: Um Batalhão Brasileiro Na Linha Gótica","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Durval Lourenço Pereira","original_name":"Durval Lourenço Pereira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d55941bbc86576e722cbaa9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Durval Lourenço Pereira","original_name":"Durval Lourenço Pereira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d559421e8131d3e3389ca60","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5784096","wikidata_id":"Q26869057","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/qMquKcJerAlXkzqEB1Yi0dURWED.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
