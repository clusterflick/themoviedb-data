Back home, he is thrust into battle once again, but he hasn't been trained for this type of warfare. With his career behind him and painful physical therapy ahead, he finds himself without a purpose and in a war with his own mind. Having spent years with an ocean between them, his wife, Michelle, is distant and their marriage seems to be held together only by her sense of duty.  From leading troops into battle to being unable to leave the house, Vic finds himself isolated in more ways than he ever thought possible, until the unexpected happens. Through the help of two kids and some unlikely heroes, Vic must face the trauma and the wounds on his soul to save his marriage and to help his fellow brother in need. To succeed he must discover the true source of strength and realize he can't do it alone if he is going to win this war and emerge STRONGER.","popularity":0.3153,"poster_path":"/A52KJCjWfA34O7fVEoAqjWtj5UD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Stronger","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Stronger","type":"Shortened"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulises Larramendi","original_name":"Ulises Larramendi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Victor Raphael","credit_id":"5d550dd9e8131d2479896334","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Sweet","original_name":"Angela Sweet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Michelle Raphael","credit_id":"5d550df64bc38b2919243b42","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justina Page","original_name":"Justina Page","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Aunt Hazel","credit_id":"5d550e0e4bc38b3503240def","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Ortolano","original_name":"Don Ortolano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Tommy Ortel","credit_id":"5d550e1fe8131d7f9e8957a7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2387665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryce C Miller","original_name":"Bryce C Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Dan Jamieson","credit_id":"5d550e484bc38b2919243b88","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387653,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robin B.
