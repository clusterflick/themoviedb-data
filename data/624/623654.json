These rare films - discovered after a fire tragically destroyed the model masterpiece in 1972 - capture the devotion and sly humor that Allen infused into his miniature universe. Trains in two gauges cross snow-capped mountains and more than 100 soaring bridges. Despite outlaws, train wrecks, trolleys, bustling cities and thousands of miniature people inhabit this world. Get a peek into the mind of its creator to see his innovative techniques now in common use by model railroaders around the globe. From track-side close ups to sweeping vistas, the expert photography of Richard Reynolds and Glenn Beier will inspire train fans and model railroaders alike - indeed anyone with an imagination!","popularity":0.2431,"poster_path":"/vN3bfFl97jxr7EeXhKBILW7z3Us.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunday River Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Allen's Gorre & Daphetid","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.653,"height":2170,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vN3bfFl97jxr7EeXhKBILW7z3Us.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1417}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13008,"name":"train"},{"id":18044,"name":"railroad"},{"id":211673,"name":"scale model"},{"id":241745,"name":"model railways"},{"id":256087,"name":"trains"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
