A solitary worker, who’s most likely dedicated all of his life to this big dying monster, is finally forced to face reality. He’s got only one friend − his big black and white canine companion. Almost with no words and with a great irruption of archive material, Julietta Korbel portrays this man and the Chavalon power plant with the gentleness of who’s shooting a real-life documentary subject.","popularity":0.0767,"poster_path":"/fDbaZP8A96OwHjRyOWwAn22DEyK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23845,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thera Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2019-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Working","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2745306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beat Wittwer","original_name":"Beat Wittwer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3a7f3d7390c0003a6169a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1810512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Baptiste Le Vaillant","original_name":"Jean-Baptiste Le Vaillant","popularity":0.0937,"profile_path":"/mSJ5LzVrFSjcobLXgNWxvGl0Gpl.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3a7f48c5840d0034a082af","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2363843,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julien Rouyet","original_name":"Julien Rouyet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613e699f19ab5900639cf5b5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176754,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Raphaël Lefèvre","original_name":"Raphaël Lefèvre","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d53c9fc6dc6c07b0898647d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2386832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julietta Korbel","original_name":"Julietta Korbel","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/ycyxvKxfd0neaDeNpJm3vTs4XVC.jpg","credit_id":"5d53c9aae18b970017d22369","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386837,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benjamin Bucher","original_name":"Benjamin Bucher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d53c9dce18b9727f0d20325","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386838,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Camille Bonard","original_name":"Camille Bonard","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d53c9eae18b9727f0d2033e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2386832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julietta Korbel","original_name":"Julietta Korbel","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/ycyxvKxfd0neaDeNpJm3vTs4XVC.jpg","credit_id":"5f3a7f74a3b5e60036ee2346","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386835,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carlos Tapia González","original_name":"Carlos Tapia González","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3a7f5246aed40037617e2e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10623528","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mgYbjmZ0FBoxZEUI3KKyNkTIflj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2806,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fDbaZP8A96OwHjRyOWwAn22DEyK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2019-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New Holland Island International Debut Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
