What emerges is a potent and inspiring story of Jewish pluralism and a community navigating the cross-currents of Jewish tradition and social change. Beyond the struggle to create a supportive environment for gay and lesbian students and teachers at the school, this is the story of a community wrestling with the very definition of pluralism and diversity in a Jewish context.","popularity":0.0552,"poster_path":"/wEWoDqwlSYqimzYIsi6kJDQx5kP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hineini: Coming Out in a Jewish High School","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irena Fayngold","original_name":"Irena Fayngold","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5330d3cee2f60011287967","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0846699","wikidata_id":"Q12124782","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.733,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wEWoDqwlSYqimzYIsi6kJDQx5kP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
