This unhealthy obsession leads to Dehan struggling to reconnect with his young son, Erich, who survived the car accident that caused Lena's death.  Dehan must decide to face and to confront his grief, reconnecting with his son, or to become so immersed in his fantasy dream-world that he loses touch with reality, and Erich, altogether.","popularity":1.4752,"poster_path":"/311PR2z91ouT2WDgtnJ7a9c2zPg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107047,"logo_path":null,"name":"AFDA","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South
