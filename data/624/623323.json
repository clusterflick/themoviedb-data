When sleazy theatrical agent Maurice Beiner (Arthur Donaldson) is found stabbed to death in his office, just about everybody is a suspect -- there's aspiring actress Clancy Deane (Eileen Huban), who was one of the last people to see him alive, and Sophie Carey (Alma Rubens) who knows he has some love letters she wrote to Judge Walbrough (George MacQuarrie) before she married her alcoholic husband, Don (Henry Sedley). Or is it Marc Weber (Norman Kerry), who had a falling out with Beiner, or Weber's devoted wife, Fay (Ethel Duray)?","popularity":0.1669,"poster_path":"/mHkg4PivCzbVZfoNBg6mTyOxRUv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1442,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cosmopolitan Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Find the Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma Rubens","original_name":"Alma Rubens","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/5E4uO4iO6cw0FsOL2oUcytqM1XN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sophie Carey","credit_id":"5d548b80b76cbb0013d85164","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eileen Huban","original_name":"Eileen Huban","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Clancy Deane","credit_id":"5d548b896905fb00173e5fa3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harrison Ford","original_name":"Harrison Ford","popularity":0.2344,"profile_path":"/1KSM8u8vBYCYybMOFxythVJPNqD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Philip Vandevent","credit_id":"5d548b8fa135330012fb56b0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":952657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George MacQuarrie","original_name":"George MacQuarrie","popularity":0.1413,"profile_path":"/9eGUVUBTQLA6e3uT0YmZQ72hPbT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Judge Walbrough","credit_id":"5d548b95a135330012fb56c8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Kerry","original_name":"Norman Kerry","popularity":0.1631,"profile_path":"/luQTt1kDR73AclpZeFeQPzPuhjc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Marc Weber","credit_id":"5d548b9bb76cbb0013d85181","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Duray","original_name":"Ethel Duray","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Fab Weber","credit_id":"5d548ba26905fb00163e5e94","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Donaldson","original_name":"Arthur Donaldson","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/iNsq7CbzoyPfExTeXZoK1wJBTPa.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Morris Beiner","credit_id":"6179ced95294e70044fc1689","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Sedley","original_name":"Henry Sedley","popularity":0.1206,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Don Carey","credit_id":"6179cee8f2cf25008ca02429","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Deane","original_name":"Sydney Deane","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/aX7cEajVpsH5N4A4gmauUjvDEXO.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Sofford","credit_id":"6179cefbeee1860046f0743d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Fitzroy","original_name":"Emily Fitzroy","popularity":0.2089,"profile_path":"/4V6A5auvNlrXcVPFdua8MfiC2ms.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Napoli","credit_id":"6179cf5b71f0950042d7cd31","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148067,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tom Terriss","original_name":"Tom Terriss","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/jUDuJf578pkk4a5QrxaNL2ZsAP2.jpg","credit_id":"5d548b77a135330011fb52d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1592472,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Doty Hobart","original_name":"Doty Hobart","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d548b6ca135330013fb5016","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0013126","wikidata_id":"Q17105417","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sxDOUJMy0R752vYVvsgts6DncGq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mHkg4PivCzbVZfoNBg6mTyOxRUv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":215678,"name":"partially lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1922-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
