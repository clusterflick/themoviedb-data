Innocent and pleasing images, such as a swimming frog or snowy street scene, are followed by statements of love and implied violence. These are inter-cut with strange, disconnected images, such as close-ups of flowers, body parts or food. The mood of the film gradually becomes darker and more unsettling, though nothing is stated directly. The growing intensity of the film is reinforced by the oppressive rhythm of a drum which accompanies snatches of music and speech.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It, Heat, Hit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laure Prouvost","original_name":"Laure Prouvost","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d544c084b0c6300197aae3a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laure Prouvost","original_name":"Laure Prouvost","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d544bb555c926001725784e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laure Prouvost","original_name":"Laure Prouvost","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d544bf955c92600132576ea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laure Prouvost","original_name":"Laure Prouvost","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d544c22e18b970015d2d847","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laure Prouvost","original_name":"Laure Prouvost","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d544bcf4b0c63147679fa31","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
