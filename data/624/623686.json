He gets some helpful advice from his \"Good Sense.\"  There's so much to consider... time period, type of traffic, and scale. Wayne selects a 1950's-era branch line in HO. The Atlas track components cause the size to be 4'6\" x 3'8\".  L-girder is perfect for the Marengo, Milwaukee & Northern. We need 1x1s, 1x2s, 1x3s, 1x4s, 2x2s, and a sheet of 1/2\" plywood.  \"Keep it simple\" is good advice for a first-time layout. However, by dividing the layout into 4 blocks we can run two trains.  Polyfoam is the base for the scenic landforms. Wayne adds laytex paint, ground foam, and rocks. Artist's acrylic Gloss Medium forms the lake. All the structures get some weathering.  Wayne lists some of the problem areas - couplers, track, and trucks - and shows you how to make them work properly. Locomotives can also be a source of trouble if you fail to maintain them.","popularity":0.5102,"poster_path":"/sxzxSZ9oxOLkl7p9y14jzrCCOp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalmbach Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Basics of Model Railroading with Wayne Wesolowski","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2388615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Wesolowski","original_name":"Wayne Wesolowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d56c9bfe8131d4aa189dd91","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sxzxSZ9oxOLkl7p9y14jzrCCOp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13008,"name":"train"},{"id":18044,"name":"railroad"},{"id":241745,"name":"model railways"},{"id":256087,"name":"trains"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
