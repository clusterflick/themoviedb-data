They are very close. They live together, sharing the living space, the mobile phone, and a huge old Cadillac. We don’t know where their parents are. But they are present only in the boys’ conversations.  Through a series of dreams and hallucinations, we get a glimpse into Ryan’s mental state before his brother does. We are given the opportunity to see the world through the eyes of a young man struggling with his sexuality in the stuffy environment of the margins. He is down with the Cadillac blues.","popularity":0.0511,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cadillac Blues","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1880178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mazen Khaled","original_name":"Mazen Khaled","popularity":0.2597,"profile_path":"/gh4sUn7l6LDvUsCYHB4RxHVCnlf.jpg","credit_id":"5dd800d912aabc00138e77d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1395165","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
