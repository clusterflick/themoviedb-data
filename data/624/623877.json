It is a film about men who prefer to live life as an abstract game and the free-spirited woman who changes everything. Said and Youssef have fulfilled a life-long dream by opening a \"chess bar\" in the middle of the desert. They sit around drinking palm wine, playing board games and composing love poetry to imaginary women.  All this changes with the arrival of Sarah, a sexually liberated, uninhibited metisse who easily lures Youssef into an affair. Soon he is dreaming not about chess but about opening a coffee bar in Genoa. The friendship is destroyed, the bar sold. Youssef, dressed in Western clothes, waits to leave with Sarah; will she show up? Said boards a train and sits down next to a Westernized woman bearing a resemblance to Sarah","popularity":0.2664,"poster_path":"/hy1GCHvhBQqG4a16YDpscOFEz3S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13728,"logo_path":"/bpsUvoLS3Xms2xXOPQFq5nLZI5J.png","name":"Nomadis Images","origin_country":"TN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"}],"release_date":"1997-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sabriya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fethi Akkari","original_name":"Fethi Akkari","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/44iY9dqpkmjmGnUpJUoKVBVwjka.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Barman","credit_id":"5d580ffc1684f70016c9dc5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chawki Bouglia","original_name":"Chawki Bouglia","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/krda1rv4WhwMtQrjgZDX3JtMMsj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Youssef","credit_id":"5d58100be8131d4aa18b3975","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2389250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rim Turki","original_name":"Rim Turki","popularity":0.0706,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sarra","credit_id":"5d581030e8131d4a038b41be","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nabil Chahed","original_name":"Nabil Chahed","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Said","credit_id":"5d58103e4bc38b350327ee42","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdellfattah Abdellatif","original_name":"Abdellfattah Abdellatif","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Matches Man","credit_id":"5d58104fe8131d4aa18b39c0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1159577,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dora Bouchoucha","original_name":"Dora Bouchoucha","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df41bb9638640149d74d13","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abderrahmane Sissako","original_name":"Abderrahmane Sissako","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/lQew5sGuT5Tni75EuFBnG3FjZ6n.jpg","credit_id":"64523d7bd48cee0119a06c6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389256,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Slim Ennaceur","original_name":"Slim Ennaceur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5810b8e8131d6f6f89ad3c","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389258,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Abderrahmane Sissako","original_name":"Abderrahmane Sissako","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5810dde8131d6f6f89ad58","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389257,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Naceur Kaabi","original_name":"Naceur Kaabi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5810c64bc38b350327ee93","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Art Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389254,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Faouzy Thabet","original_name":"Faouzy Thabet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5810884bc38b60d4261735","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1605089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saïda Ben Mahmoud","original_name":"Saïda Ben Mahmoud","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d581096e8131d4aa18b39ee","department":"Directing","job":"Continuity"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604802,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Youssef Ben Youssef","original_name":"Youssef Ben Youssef","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d58107de8131d720089af2a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0192560","wikidata_id":"Q7396447","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hy1GCHvhBQqG4a16YDpscOFEz3S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"1997-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
