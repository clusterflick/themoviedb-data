In 2002, an all new train exhibit was introduced. It was greeted with wild enthusiasm by both kids and grown-ups. The Great Train Story shows the importance of railroads today by focusing on four major functions - inter-modal transportation, passenger service, transporting grain, and moving raw materials.
