In contrast, his up-and-coming colleague Dr. Schäfer sees abortion as a means of helping women in need and openly advocates an amendment of the law. The professor’s convictions are shaken when misfortune befalls his own family. Louise Fleck presents her drama about the untimeliness of restrictive abortion legislation against the backdrop of modern urban reality. Seriousness, however, is preserved, because topics such as unwanted pregnancy, sexual violence, and the consequences of improperly performed abortions are not only addressed through minor characters, but also placed at the center of the cinematic narrative.
