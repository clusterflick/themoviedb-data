The climatic factor is depicted as a visual metaphor of the society and the internal self of individuals. The dryness in the male character and the desolate landscape critiques the patriarchal system of that time.\r \"Un Matoneado\" tells the story of Gabriel’s revenge. His hate and wish of death turns into a big mistake. It is an example of the sociocultural context of the countryside people, and once again the patriarchal point of view of how one´s supposed to deal with problems \"as a man\".","popularity":0.0781,"poster_path":"/7R94zPNy3L5TqhIxD5ScROjNvtP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sibú Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","name":"Costa Rica"}],"release_date":"2015-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unos cuentos de Angustias y Paisajes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3719995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Ríos","original_name":"Melissa Ríos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"63351bccafe2240090869e70","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3719996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mauricio Morales","original_name":"Mauricio Morales","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"63351bf1c26796008134c798","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3719997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giezi Portilla","original_name":"Giezi Portilla","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"63351bfbcb75d1007e23e243","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3719998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Campos","original_name":"Manuel Campos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"63351c098c3159007a5a1fa9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3719991,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sofía Steiner","original_name":"Sofía Steiner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63351b743780620082e4b8a6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662949,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carlos Salazar Herrera","original_name":"Carlos Salazar Herrera","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63351b2a528b2e008499caa8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenstory"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3719994,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Douglas Mora Aguilera","original_name":"Douglas Mora Aguilera","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63351bb2a1c59d0091a31c1e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3719993,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ximena Miranda","original_name":"Ximena Miranda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63351ba089f749007b535044","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2388939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jose Morales","original_name":"Jose Morales","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/xeE8GB8sfS98H1KqveblbhGUbjt.jpg","credit_id":"6429cc21ac8e6b0093ea186f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2388939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jose Morales","original_name":"Jose Morales","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/xeE8GB8sfS98H1KqveblbhGUbjt.jpg","credit_id":"6429cce79cc67b05bf6f8249","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2388938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Morales","original_name":"Jorge Morales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6429ccd8ac8e6b00b4d5f65d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2388938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Morales","original_name":"Jorge Morales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6429cc108de0ae00f4c08498","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2388939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jose Morales","original_name":"Jose Morales","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/xeE8GB8sfS98H1KqveblbhGUbjt.jpg","credit_id":"6429cc3c9cc67b05796bd452","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2388938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Morales","original_name":"Jorge Morales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6429ccb2c0442901e81796ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":1027,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7R94zPNy3L5TqhIxD5ScROjNvtP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":664}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
