Her sweetheart, Ronald McKane, a struggling civil engineer (Edmund Burns), is encouraging her to join him in New York, but she only goes when she is bequeathed an inheritance. Unfortunately, the amount adds up to less than ten dollars a week. When she meets banker Sanford Gillespie (Robert Edeson), she convinces him to help McKane out financially. Once McKane has become a success, Judy marries him, but then he becomes interested in another woman. Judy seeks revenge and asks Gillespie to ruin her estranged husband, offering him anything he wants in return.","popularity":0.2777,"poster_path":"/k12VbKznNBbTQst8YCvMdeHbDvR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28230,"logo_path":null,"name":"DeMille Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hell's Highroad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leatrice Joy","original_name":"Leatrice Joy","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":"/mUrizNrPg9AfitR1kQLQnKdxEAT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Judy Nichols","credit_id":"5d5775f6bc86574b352ef6b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Burns","original_name":"Edmund Burns","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":"/nm91OSyVUWeegGhh1yCuwkpj7a8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ronald McKane","credit_id":"5d5775fbbc865777712c2879","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Edeson","original_name":"Robert Edeson","popularity":0.1969,"profile_path":"/qWHUMZ3pBUhoDH781Zhnon9xRqu.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sanford Gillespie","credit_id":"5d5776014bc38b3503275b4d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Faye","original_name":"Julia Faye","popularity":0.1776,"profile_path":"/eSA5VSoh8CIg7SjREn4yWBmbObW.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Anne Broderick","credit_id":"5d5776084bc38b19542728d3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1269811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helene Sullivan","original_name":"Helene Sullivan","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/1csk2XLwrXBZ6VXWBTZUSyiunye.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dorothy Harmon","credit_id":"5d57760fe8131d4aa18a9d12","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rupert Julian","original_name":"Rupert Julian","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/9dWgryyjsLz1dw9cxMNvuB5piEh.jpg","credit_id":"5d5775c9bc86574b352ef693","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84237,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lenore J.
