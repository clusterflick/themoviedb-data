Leon confides to his unscrupulous model Romildo, that he is attracted to Yvonne. Romildo drugs his lover, fiery Apache dancer Juliette who closely resembles Yvonne, then tries to extort money from Leon to have his way with her. Leon discovers the duplicity but convinces the artist's sweetheart, Dick Gray, that she has been unfaithful. As police close in on Leon, he frames Yvonne by planting forged paintings in her studio. Following Yvonne's arrest, Juliette is informed by her foster sister that she was stolen by gypsies as a child and is actually Yvonne's twin sister. Juliette exposes Leon's operation to the police, reuniting Yvonne and Dick.","popularity":0.1734,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":240699,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tyrad Pictures Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Happened in Paris","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madame Yorska","original_name":"Madame Yorska","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Juliette / Yvonne Dupré","credit_id":"5d558b1a4bc38b1955249682","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":987109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawson Butt","original_name":"Lawson Butt","popularity":0.0991,"profile_path":"/ctPkPl6szDxGYplA1cNaMgDy52k.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Romildo, the Gypsy","credit_id":"5d558b1fe8131d3e3489bb21","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Dione","original_name":"Rose Dione","popularity":0.1865,"profile_path":"/sKTDYt1i8PiBQmqb962tyyeGN3O.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Creota","credit_id":"5d558b26e8131d3e3389bf25","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Gunn","original_name":"Charles Gunn","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":"/4eQXdUj3Qz7weEbevE5NbmQgxIe.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dick Gray","credit_id":"5d558b2de8131d3e3389bf38","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1419859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayward Mack","original_name":"Hayward Mack","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/cbsFsmIPDLxiQmgL3GIYL2zdBEh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Leon Naisson","credit_id":"5d558b334bc38b1954249511","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":588703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Bernhardt","original_name":"Sarah Bernhardt","popularity":0.1122,"profile_path":"/z86wlobeTeNV6qmIPHCPPeXO6ud.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d558b3be8131d3e3689bf3d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hartford","original_name":"David Hartford","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/zHvuxNYkBLIIAGKaZgw0mdAPgv0.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66fdd885fa3e69e0ef7c69d7","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hartford","original_name":"David Hartford","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/zHvuxNYkBLIIAGKaZgw0mdAPgv0.jpg","credit_id":"5d558af84bc38b717124e86c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99379,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jack Cunningham","original_name":"Jack Cunningham","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d558b024bc38b350324ba97","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2362759,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Madeline Matzen","original_name":"Madeline Matzen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d558b5ae8131d3e2789be9f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":588703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Bernhardt","original_name":"Sarah Bernhardt","popularity":0.1122,"profile_path":"/z86wlobeTeNV6qmIPHCPPeXO6ud.jpg","credit_id":"5d558b0cbc86574b352c5a24","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0190486","wikidata_id":"Q83972792","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1919-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
