A grotesque fairy tale, staged in the real lives of the characters. A completely self-produced movie, designed and directed by two visual artists, with the purpose of telling the tale of Artaserse, a retired worker, boxer, trainer and life-long painter. Everything is staged in an industrial, now decadent Terni; like a steel bay without the sea, here it's difficult to dream about becoming an artist. This movie is like a suburban western movie; the boxer and the painting dancing the communal square dance together, in life and death, the meeting-match between Artaserse and an allegorical and remorseless art world, and more generically, the battle of all the colorful characters, appearing throughout.","popularity":0.3303,"poster_path":"/ptjKcNW5N2VcE8Pr8UVkDG27DGM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121993,"logo_path":null,"name":"VERSUS","origin_country":""},{"id":198303,"logo_path":"/ntBtNP2c2M5yJYQHh8isbKoJj91.png","name":"ElectroWish Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ARTASERSE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2388688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristiano Carotti","original_name":"Cristiano Carotti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gp8gfymXS4PIqrCD3Ynqno4iFQX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"screenstory","credit_id":"5d56e96fe8131d3e338bc5cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desiderio Sanzi","original_name":"Desiderio Sanzi","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/rGRCRAuGXyaragWOcAIyaoAywj5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"screenstory","credit_id":"5d56e97be8131d3e278bc0a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1795188,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alessandro Deflorio","original_name":"Alessandro Deflorio","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/huohH9ZWte4BWHo6f3b4Vslm7QM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"sound editor","credit_id":"5d56e9934bc38b350326c11c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desiderio Sanzi","original_name":"Desiderio Sanzi","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/rGRCRAuGXyaragWOcAIyaoAywj5.jpg","credit_id":"5d56e1a2e8131d3e338bbbdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2388688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristiano Carotti","original_name":"Cristiano Carotti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gp8gfymXS4PIqrCD3Ynqno4iFQX.jpg","credit_id":"5d56e1cce8131d3e278bb904","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"ArtaserseFilm","instagram_id":"versusidol","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/5XhNgfcGthFBpHTgr2hOY5GtOvG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/mFiw0qxESNySCiOy0thwJREMap9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r5z82LCB1OGGK9fY51YJnxi10b5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2857,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/ptjKcNW5N2VcE8Pr8UVkDG27DGM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2792,"name":"boxer"},{"id":437,"name":"painter"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"CINETECA BOLOGNA","release_date":"2020-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ARTASERSE (Official Trailer) 2020","key":"DFps3IS-Yl8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-01-17T09:56:53.000Z","id":"5e218518397df00016981a2d"}]}}}
