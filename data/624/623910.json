One hundred years later, Kerry Laitala pays tribute to this historical moment with a dual-projector performance involving archival images of silhouetted spectators of the 1939 New York Worldâ€™s Fair sharing screen space with sinuous light shapes swirling, twinkling and bouncing across the frame like unbound forces of energy. The City Luminous: Spectacle of Light will be accompanied by a live soundtrack by Voicehandler (Jacob Felix Heule and Danishta Rivero), who manipulate sounds from various sources including a mechanical music box from Switzerland.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/hlIuphBB4WV44GLz15BJLP7Lplp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The City Luminous: Spectacle of Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kerry Laitala","original_name":"Kerry Laitala","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d583e374bc38b195427e6a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389342,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Danishta Rivero","original_name":"Danishta Rivero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d583e584bc38b35032813c0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389341,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacob Felix Heule","original_name":"Jacob Felix Heule","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d583e4c4bc38b1d84240dbc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.618,"height":1140,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hlIuphBB4WV44GLz15BJLP7Lplp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":705}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
