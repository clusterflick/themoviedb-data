Taking inspiration for their evolving sound from New York's new-wave clubs of the early 1980s and newly acquired sequencers and keyboards, electronic instrumentation quickly drove New Order's songwriting process, conceiving global smash-hit Blue Monday. This film also explores the impact of the technological shifts that took place in the early 1980s as the digital-age began to percolate through all parts of society - from commerce and financial trading, to offices and home entertainment; with contributions from graphic designer Peter Saville, Blue Monday producer Michael Johnson and American record producer Arthur Baker.","popularity":0.4004,"poster_path":"/uhTvUsia7I2XqrBCsJYmnctID0L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Record On: New Order - Power, Corruption & Lies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"New Order: Macht, Korruption und LÃ¼gen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Sumner","original_name":"Bernard Sumner","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":"/oFZNNTdpgKz00R73xim8F1UrFST.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"671f7be7769107d77b48474a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Morris","original_name":"Stephen Morris","popularity":0.0832,"profile_path":"/gIQC4yI4tyqIuFx2otUAeofNkZN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"671f7bf9769107d77b484752","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":223504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gillian Gilbert","original_name":"Gillian Gilbert","popularity":0.1087,"profile_path":"/uSIXTCX3TgL2dsNRu2nePyBTF5J.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"671f7c0f1ea33928297db88c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Hook","original_name":"Peter Hook","popularity":0.2365,"profile_path":"/GDfmCcp1GWU3QlMiPzD5jJmvms.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"self","credit_id":"671f7c606e4210780f797e2a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Saville","original_name":"Peter Saville","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"self","credit_id":"671f7cb21ea33928297db8e3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5027195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Barnard","original_name":"David Barnard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f73cfa4ac8a432c5cc413","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825629,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Steve Kendrick","original_name":"Steve Kendrick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f7cd44be15469e70e42ff","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29943114","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/9KOX9umQwLjJCUkztklj89Zoqnl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oiLO5XF6e8J1MpXB69pI3GULzB3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":842,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uhTvUsia7I2XqrBCsJYmnctID0L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":595},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":794,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/7cNAFNuT1PEKW0qDSIycwyL0bQ6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
