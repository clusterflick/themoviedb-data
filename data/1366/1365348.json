Captured by a broken frame composition, deserted streets, frozen city infrastructure, stone embankments, pigeons in parks, dandelions breaking through the pavements, aberrations of color and light evoke an increasing sense of unease. Ambient sounds—random conversations, city noises, and a track composed by Mexican sound artist Enrique Arriaga—merge with the visuals, making the film a direct speech of a human/camera/witness about what clearly audible in the actual urban space.","popularity":0.0964,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There is Still More to Come","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Все еще впереди","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Vse esche vperedi","type":"Transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Vsyo eschyo vperedi","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1533250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masha Godovannaya","original_name":"Masha Godovannaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yoGyCAOzzVTAN21U6ywj7IVBHxc.jpg","credit_id":"66fda2b1e84eeb35a0f7a69d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1533250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masha Godovannaya","original_name":"Masha Godovannaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yoGyCAOzzVTAN21U6ywj7IVBHxc.jpg","credit_id":"66fda2b6c9a10d46ea7c5e97","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1533250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masha Godovannaya","original_name":"Masha Godovannaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yoGyCAOzzVTAN21U6ywj7IVBHxc.jpg","credit_id":"671393f90cb6252f990842b3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1533250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masha Godovannaya","original_name":"Masha Godovannaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yoGyCAOzzVTAN21U6ywj7IVBHxc.jpg","credit_id":"67139400650248b9db620478","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
