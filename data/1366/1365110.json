What can queer Eva do to free herself from the endless androcentric and patriarchal narratives?  These questions can be answered by queer theologian Marcella Althaus-Reid:” Queer theology is the one who confesses distance from home without even knowing where home is for her, rejecting all representations of herself or her own representations of others that deny the reality of exile as a place to be. A theology that can only participate in the contiguous processes of representation of people in transit, nomadic subjects who follow their own deep desire for different forms of purity and holiness, and find grace especially in the lands inhabited by sexual exile.”  Eve thus becomes here an uneven recomposition, embracing her figurative repetitions to the point of vacuity,  through ecstasy, so it is not possible to direct oneself to the body without ruptures, discontinuities, inconsistencies, contradictions","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/mr0s0X41r8GwJRzjaUFgat9eBKE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait of Eve","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Ritratto di Eva","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4975959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giulia Orsatti","original_name":"Giulia Orsatti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Eva","credit_id":"66fd42e367b2a16466d072b3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2646491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmine Lo Regio","original_name":"Carmine Lo Regio","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fd42f8c6fbb2f0cdf2456a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2646491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmine Lo Regio","original_name":"Carmine Lo Regio","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ba3c69bd48e8924cbeba93","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2646491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmine Lo Regio","original_name":"Carmine Lo Regio","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ba3c8aa96dc18979beb2e1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2646491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmine Lo Regio","original_name":"Carmine Lo Regio","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ba3cac06b5536bdc0a9318","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iYrZninOx4vtMVcaSfOazUOHAsZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1689,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u5vdI2FVUq8NM61MOr90G0ItWcM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1126},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/mr0s0X41r8GwJRzjaUFgat9eBKE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
