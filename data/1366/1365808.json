In what is undoubtedly one of the greatest challenges a video game studio has ever faced, the developers at GSC Game World work under the ravaging conditions of war to bring the highly anticipated game S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl to life. As they battle the emotional toll of displacement, personal loss, and political upheaval, they must find the strength and resilience to keep their artistic vision alive. With personal stories of sacrifice, determination, and hope, the film offers a powerful insight into the human toll of conflict and the transformative power of creative expression.","popularity":0.273,"poster_path":"/mWsgFYXuWJo4sY0FaYXNSQm1tD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5133,"logo_path":"/6flSXpvY2t4SMWtRKyx26DTaMhf.png","name":"Microsoft","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United
