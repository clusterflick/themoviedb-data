Having resurfaced, she has no choice but to confront them in this dark night of the soul. “Gołębie” can be described as a happy accident. The film came together on two different occasions on two different days, begging to be made. It is an exercise in crafting a narrative out of completely non-diegetic sound and the sheer manipulative power of cinema as a medium.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2024-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pigeons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4977069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anosh Aibara","original_name":"Anosh Aibara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fdb9aec9a10d46ea7c66eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
