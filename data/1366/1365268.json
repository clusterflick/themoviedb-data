Citizen George moves back and forth in time, highlighting specific events of George's activist life - including fighting for civil rights, anti-Vietnam War activism, LGBTQ rights, human rights in Sri Lanka and climate justice. In addition to detailing his life as an activist, Citizen George tells George's personal journey as a husband, father and out gay man. Animated sequences, inspired by graphic novels, illustrate scenes from George's life. Since the age of 19, George has been conscious of his life's purpose - to use whatever gifts he has to work for justice and peace. Today, at 86 years of age, George's message of a nonviolent revolution is more urgent than ever.","popularity":0.0645,"poster_path":"/7aJL5C3PygRl8qkblm7gBYZatzP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citizen George","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Glenn Holsten","original_name":"Glenn Holsten","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fd81c7fa3e69e0ef7c57dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33505458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ukuN7MY2R4JKfcc198ELDwylN26.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7aJL5C3PygRl8qkblm7gBYZatzP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7ov7DhTIord7H5aDnl8bfE3JOfA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Philadelphia Film Festival screening","release_date":"2024-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
