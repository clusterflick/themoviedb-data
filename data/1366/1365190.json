When Rolande Ségalini died, everything remained as it was during her lifetime. But what to do with all the accumulated things? As her granddaughter Céline begins to film this material legacy, she realises that her grandmother has remained an enigma to her to this day. Room by room, she inventories, classes, counts, sorts the possessions retrieved from wardrobes, drawers, cabinets and boxes and arranges the objects into new still lives. It is an attempt to understand the deceased woman better and find out more about her. Step by step, the heiress discovers various connections to France’s colonial history.","popularity":0.3382,"poster_path":"/gKTx7LAaUWgz0lTQ961QKQBGtfR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76104,"logo_path":"/9aF2Hw6dnKrhmnADmqWUf65wfUC.png","name":"Novanima Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":143673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kanaldude","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Things of a Lifetime, Intimate Archeological Exercises","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Things of a lifetime, intimate archeological exercises","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4976156,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Céline Ségalini","original_name":"Céline Ségalini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fd5b9fb3f1281d7c5964a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2676965,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Faye","original_name":"Marc Faye","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fd5baa6c365985c8f24c3e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654487,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anne-Laure Viaud","original_name":"Anne-Laure Viaud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fd5be17041d60f33d0755a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2942791,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christophe Leroy","original_name":"Christophe Leroy","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fd5bfd6c365985c8f24c67","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4898658,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alban Petit","original_name":"Alban Petit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fd5c167041d60f33d0756d","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951148,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Loic Villiot","original_name":"Loic Villiot","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fd5c277041d60f33d0757d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4976160,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guillaume Flamen","original_name":"Guillaume Flamen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fd5c507e9037323759654a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2610258,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pierre Nativel","original_name":"Pierre Nativel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fd5c60df2aba95b3f24bc6","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gKTx7LAaUWgz0lTQ961QKQBGtfR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1284,"name":"identity"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":4849,"name":"exile"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":41388,"name":"portrait"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
