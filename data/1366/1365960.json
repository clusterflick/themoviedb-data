Diawara’s camera follows Davis as she walks through a forest of giant sequoias, works in the garden or walks her dog, while reflecting on myriad issues, including ideas of freedom, resistance, rebellion, remaking our world, political blackness, radical black thought, music, (inter)nationalism, (Global South) feminism, abolition, the industrial prison complex, generational shifts, dialectics, contradiction, Africa, sexuality, desire and also friendship. The film is neither a biography nor a fictional narrative. Instead, Diawara’s footage, which is interspersed with relevant archival material, presents itself as a poetic compendium of Davis’s critical thinking and an inspiration for new imaginaries and new relations within an emergent new world.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angela Davis: A World of Greater Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manthia Diawara","original_name":"Manthia Diawara","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/bBuSiqgjfJzbuKMNlP7HDmOoIB6.jpg","credit_id":"66ff3d00e4801491468503a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manthia Diawara","original_name":"Manthia Diawara","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/bBuSiqgjfJzbuKMNlP7HDmOoIB6.jpg","credit_id":"66ff3d29b146282f7b84fc9b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26747768","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
