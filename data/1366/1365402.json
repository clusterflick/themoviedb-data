The title is referred to the eponymous 1928 OBERIU’s film by Klimenti Mints and Aleksandr Razumovsky, which was proclaimed as an anti-war statement by the authors. “Meat Grinder 2” is constructed from the lines of people who witnessed an air raid. Each line reflects a certain auditory experience, and together they are built into a chronicle of one single day, the sequence of events of which is deconstructed in the film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meat Grinder 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Myasorubka 2","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2808331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikita Spiridonov","original_name":"Nikita Spiridonov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fdb7c1f878adfed084bb48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2808331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikita Spiridonov","original_name":"Nikita Spiridonov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fdb7c5f878adfed084bb4c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
