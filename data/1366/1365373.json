The eldest son loved the sea, but it punished him for his insolence. The middle son used to talk to the sea, but it stopped answering him. The younger son was swallowed up by the sea, which took him with it. After many long years of wandering, the three brothers reunite on their native island of Sakhalin to restore the connections they lost and finally say farewell to their sea.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/de2hQwCpBKanuzvTJr4QqVUlZCD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell My Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Прощай, мое море","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Proschay, moe more","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Proschay, moyo more","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4976927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Kan","original_name":"Sergey Kan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fdac171592ef1ba984ba69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4976927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Kan","original_name":"Sergey Kan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713813d99f22f326aacff15","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5009321,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dana Arsagty","original_name":"Dana Arsagty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713814c99f22f326aacff2b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4248801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gau Khar","original_name":"Gau Khar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713816499f22f326aacff35","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3023497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikolay Aguzarov","original_name":"Nikolay Aguzarov","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713817699f22f326aacff3e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5009321,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dana Arsagty","original_name":"Dana Arsagty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671386e0c6e304096195cbf0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4248801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gau Khar","original_name":"Gau Khar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671386e599f22f326aacfff4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3023497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikolay Aguzarov","original_name":"Nikolay Aguzarov","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671386e9c6e304096195cbf3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4976927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Kan","original_name":"Sergey Kan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671386efc6e304096195cbf6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5009321,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dana Arsagty","original_name":"Dana Arsagty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67138707c6e304096195cbfb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4976927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Kan","original_name":"Sergey Kan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713870e2bbba65f7b10bf20","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4850657,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elizaveta Bodrova","original_name":"Elizaveta Bodrova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6713872b2bbba65f7b10bf28","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/de2hQwCpBKanuzvTJr4QqVUlZCD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
