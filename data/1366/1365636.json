The amazing story of Oskar Schindler, who saved more than 3500 Jews from death during World War II. He bribed the Nazis to allow the 3500 to work in his bomb factory and thus support the war effort, they thought. As it happened, all of the bombs that they produced were duds! Watch the movie with a box of tissues because it hits you with the full horror of Nazi Germany. In spite of everything, Schindler heroically shields his 3500 from being killed. They would survive, and Schindler would end up penniless. These survivors supported Schindler financially until his death, 30 years later. Oskar Schindler is buried in Israel's Mount Zion Cemetary, in the section reserved for those who rescued Jews from the Holocaust. Fifty years after WWII, Schindler was named \"Righteous Among the Nations\" for his heroism.","popularity":0.0649,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schindler's List: 25 Years Later","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9558892","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
