Prolonged pretrial detention is a new normal under the National Security Law.\r On the eve of the 35th anniversary of June 4th, the Hong Kong national security police, for the first time after the enactment of Article 23, cited the National Security Law to arrest 8 people, accusing them of using \"a certain upcoming sensitive date\" to continuously post messages inciting hatred against the central and SAR governments.\r The arrested individuals include the imprisoned Chow Hang-tung.\r This barrister, still in prison, has received at least five international human rights awards during her period in custody. And how is her own human rights situation in prison? How does she think about the rule of law in Hong Kong?","popularity":0.2577,"poster_path":"/gSW6JJv5s6tnTZkPg9QWSxgkAMP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240753,"logo_path":null,"name":"Green Bean Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2024-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Be Seen, Be Together","title":"Letters from the Imprisoned: Chow Hang Tung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4978992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Lee","original_name":"Paul Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fedda49ebea19006f7e64e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1863,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gSW6JJv5s6tnTZkPg9QWSxgkAMP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1242}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"【預告片 Trailer】獄中信 – 鄒幸彤｜Letters from the Imprisoned: Chow Hang Tung｜動畫英文版｜Animated English version","key":"igBgqz_sQ0s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-06-03T15:00:46.000Z","id":"67172b31a77af1dbbaf8a749"}]}}}
