Every summer, the younger women visit the elders, returning to their roots and embracing a traditional way of life. This household is deeply matriarchal—men are present but play secondary roles. The film’s space is filled with rituals: fortune-telling, herb gathering, and bathing. Here, the sacred is intertwined with the mundane. The daughters follow the life paths of their mother, who once traced the steps of the older women in the family.","popularity":0.0721,"poster_path":"/vAFaqY3c2MQilYrT8on8n6IpmTP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69021,"logo_path":"/aSB6HMp0WwENBz7LScQIVTF9K4Y.png","name":"LookFilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wife to Be","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Nevesta","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4976853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatyana Yurshevskaya","original_name":"Tatyana Yurshevskaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66fda6357830c1301e7c6048","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4976856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Nikitina","original_name":"Anna Nikitina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66fda68f9ebea19006f7a93e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4976857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktoria Nikitina","original_name":"Viktoria Nikitina","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66fda6ac1592ef1ba984b744","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3866388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Nikitina","original_name":"Elena Nikitina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67df66d2b8e0fea93407c7d7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2035188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inna Omelchenko","original_name":"Inna Omelchenko","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/7JyCio9qAfsbYQTQVIywN6I7dXs.jpg","credit_id":"66fda6c39ebea19006f7a95a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2035188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inna Omelchenko","original_name":"Inna Omelchenko","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/7JyCio9qAfsbYQTQVIywN6I7dXs.jpg","credit_id":"66fda6c79ebea19006f7a95f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1464535,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aleksandr Plotnikov","original_name":"Александр Плотников","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":"/uLjHJJcevdZCxzLvxaNLuKDPckm.jpg","credit_id":"66fda6f5e48014914684b5e1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Khlebnikov","original_name":"Борис Хлебников","popularity":0.1721,"profile_path":"/wbX09o86cdZIz6dq6hYT8a6X9XW.jpg","credit_id":"66fda6fee48014914684b5e8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3671777,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Tikhonova","original_name":"Anna Tikhonova","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/cL3t4cGudmlwritarg90w8sZRmi.jpg","credit_id":"66fda707c9a10d46ea7c5f92","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2035188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inna Omelchenko","original_name":"Inna Omelchenko","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/7JyCio9qAfsbYQTQVIywN6I7dXs.jpg","credit_id":"67d28906a97c646cb58119b5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1118074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Razbezhkina","original_name":"Марина Разбежкина","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/l1FHteylK1hvL42AFgGMCY3ZJZa.jpg","credit_id":"67d28919434c98c8ec81ad24","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1549,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vAFaqY3c2MQilYrT8on8n6IpmTP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1032}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
