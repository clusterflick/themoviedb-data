Beginning in the U.S., the film examines the context in which Armenian-Americans have maintained their cultural identity following the Ottoman Empire's genocide of their people. Unfortunately, history appears to be repeating, as Azerbaijan, blockades 120,000 Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh from receiving supplies essential to their survival. In the backdrop of a brewing war, the story is transported to Armenia through the main character, a second-generation Armenian-American who visits his homeland for the first time to connect with his roots and learn about the modern challenges faced by the nation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peace for Armenia: The Plot to Destroy the First Christian Nation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4977838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Kalagian","original_name":"Douglas Kalagian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fe51d51592ef1ba984d1f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
