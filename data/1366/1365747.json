The I-Unit has built up a database of thousands of videos, photos and social media posts. Where possible it has identified the posters and those who appear.  The material reveals a range of illegal activities, from wanton destruction and looting to the demolition of entire neighbourhoods and murder.  The film also tells the story of the war through the eyes of Palestinian journalists, human rights workers and ordinary residents of the Gaza Strip. And it exposes the complicity of Western governments – in particular the use of RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus as a base for British surveillance flights over Gaza.","popularity":0.8361,"poster_path":"/zFAXpwOl1W9b5TrtV4zl7uvpPje.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62165,"logo_path":"/9i15HMPXjW657H4BnrMkeQcbktL.png","name":"Al Jazeera","origin_country":"QA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gaza","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Investigating war crimes in Gaza | Al Jazeera Investigations","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"War crimes in Gaza I Al Jazeera Investigations","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Al Jazeera Investigations: Gaza","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4990651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Basem Naim","original_name":"Bassem Naim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self -
