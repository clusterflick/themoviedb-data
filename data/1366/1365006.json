They were recommended to be erected in certain places where Ilyich could “see” how his precepts were being fulfilled. In turn, Lenin’s presence had a beneficial effect on the surrounding area. Temporary portals of sorts appeared near the monuments, leading to the communist future: flowerbeds were laid out, flags were placed, blue spruces were planted. What does Lenin see today? And what do these “islands of the future” look like now? How do the descendants of the builders of communism feel about Lenin? A film of 10 short stories, filmed in different parts of Russia.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":"/3CrgTji4gLhF2exN0ICeCSimMsd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184746,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parallax Pictures","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still With Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Vechno zhivoy","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3042135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksey Hanyutin","original_name":"Aleksey Hanyutin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fceccd6c365985c8f239ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1539923,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexandra Ivanova","original_name":"Alexandra Ivanova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fcece1c6fbb2f0cdf23514","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1604657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Gorobchuk","original_name":"Mikhail Gorobchuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/baFsx3hcWnA2je5YgLy5CQAbupO.jpg","credit_id":"66fceceabae383c10cd061b0","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3530268,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Grigory Apalayys","original_name":"Grigory Apalayys","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fcecfb25b61c33da594c93","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3827870,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aynar Kurmanguzhina","original_name":"Aynar Kurmanguzhina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fced046c365985c8f239da","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3754436,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ekaterina Meliksetova","original_name":"Ekaterina Meliksetova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fced0dc6fbb2f0cdf23519","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bQ1PxeiYrBhjW8lRrao9Tl7oMXt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/3CrgTji4gLhF2exN0ICeCSimMsd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"Central House of Cinema, Moscow","release_date":"2025-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
