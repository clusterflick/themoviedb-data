April’s life virtually began in the foster care system, and spent her formative years in households and spaces where she was abused and mistreated by those entrusted with her safety and wellbeing.  At so many points in April’s journey, an adult could have intervened and altered the course of her life for the better.  Weaving together documentary and fiction elements, the film shows us those moments to illuminate a cinematic and ultimately magical path to transforming our youth justice system.","popularity":0.0785,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little April","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"April Grayson","original_name":"April Grayson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66fef058c9a10d46ea7ca993","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zakaiya Purnell","original_name":"Zakaiya Purnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66fef0a5b146282f7b84f39a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kymonie Neal","original_name":"Kymonie Neal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66fef0aefa3e69e0ef7c9dbe","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1622584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Lear","original_name":"Ben Lear","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fef043b146282f7b84f35c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"April Grayson","original_name":"April Grayson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fef068b146282f7b84f36e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979096,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gretel Truong","original_name":"Gretel Truong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fef0866fc74e5756f7e4ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328974,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Choi Raycroft","original_name":"Laura Choi Raycroft","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fef0946fc74e5756f7e4f2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22309394","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Quentin Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
