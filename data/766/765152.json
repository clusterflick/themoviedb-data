Charlie Chaplin appears in the film, although it is unlikely he himself was involved in the production. Making use of stop-motion animation, Zepped uses possibly previously unknown outtakes of three or four earlier Chaplin films: His New Profession (1914), A Jitney Elopement (1915) and The Tramp (1915), and according to Bonhams, By the Sea (1915).  Two copies are known: one was unknowingly purchased by a collector who bought an old film reel tin on eBay for £3.20 (about $5) in September 2009 and found the nitrate film inside. He put it up for auction in June 2011 but the sole bid did not reach the £100,000 ($160,000) reserve price. The second copy was found in a tin of assorted items bought from a secondhand shop in Sheffield in July 2011.","popularity":0.1516,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1916-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zepped","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Chaplin","original_name":"Charlie Chaplin","popularity":1.8855,"profile_path":"/lRI9Ky1SMOehn04OqhYJ5hQfgIK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Tramp","credit_id":"5fb2fdf012c6040040b6df45","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19758740","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1916-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
