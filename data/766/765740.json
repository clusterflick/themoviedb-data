Con Daly loves Nora Doyle, who lives with her mother in a little cottage amid the hills and dales of old Erin. In a cave nearby the men who would free Ireland are making arms and ammunition. Robert Emmett visits them, and then goes into the enemy's camp disguised as a flute player, and returns safely. The constabulary visits a family and a riot starts, and as a result Major Kirk is shot. Desperately wounded, he is taken to the home of Mrs. Doyle. Nora and Con nurse him back to health.","popularity":0.0547,"poster_path":"/9fq1xvaIlYTv1fmYTLmkkzPc7Uv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bold Emmett, Ireland's Martyr","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentine Grant","original_name":"Valentine Grant","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Nora Doyle","credit_id":"5fb501c9c15f89003f89d6c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sidney Olcott","original_name":"Sidney Olcott","popularity":0.1264,"profile_path":"/6Eym8aO1nG6jDTR7Fk5UbqcpieM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Con Daly","credit_id":"5fb501db75110d003b04c38f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1987803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurene Santley","original_name":"Laurene Santley","popularity":0.0804,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Doyle","credit_id":"5fb501f5a22d3e003f0c47fd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2860859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"P.
