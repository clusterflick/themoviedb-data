He first places his pretty young daughter, Lucy, in a convent. After traveling for a few years from place to place, in an endeavor to find some location which he might be happy in, he settles in Lariat Hollow, a mining town. He soon falls in love with a woman of the dance hall named Anne. This incites the jealousy of Larkin, the political boss of the town. To break George Blake, Larkin nominates him for mayor, purposing to have him defeated. Anne suspects the plot and tries to influence Blake to refuse the nomination. But Blake has given his word to enter the contest and goes in to win. Blake's daughter writes to her father that she wishes to remain in the convent and become a nun. The father gives his consent. Now with every eastern tie severed, he asks Anne to marry him. She accepts, but says they will wait until after the election.","popularity":0.0725,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anne of the Golden Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Schaefer","original_name":"Anne Schaefer","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/9qRdeDOGNal4hgTZhWJ7OhLwMvG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anne Blake","credit_id":"5fb29e594a4bfc0040b7ecec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Desmond Taylor","original_name":"William Desmond Taylor","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/bYucciw59l574ezIYfSzGhprqpe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"George Blake","credit_id":"5fb29e731f0275003e5c2981","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Lederer","original_name":"Otto Lederer","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":"/gGgM7wZZbc2wiuUz9uisrnaf3Iy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Larkin","credit_id":"5fb29e8a229ae20040439604","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bebe Daniels","original_name":"Bebe Daniels","popularity":0.2266,"profile_path":"/5vZGoSlVqUXFxilSEeApppLAfLL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lucy Blake - the Daughter","credit_id":"5fb29e9c7352050040168493","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulysses Davis","original_name":"Ulysses Davis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb29ebcd0b434003ca27a58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0412415","wikidata_id":"Q18438877","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1914-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
