The comic romance tells the story of Léontine, a beautiful young widow who has become disillusioned with love. Much to her surprise, she receives a steady stream of letters and gifts from an unknown man professing his undying passion. This amuses her friend Valcour, who also claims to have no interest in romance. But now, after hiding his true feelings for years, Valcour works up the courage to reveal that he himself is the devoted secret admirer. Will his (inevitably awkward) confession sway a woman sworn to resist all affairs of the heart?","popularity":0.1205,"poster_path":"/mbJgrCinPlmVWSmNXPkHNb6msb0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Los Angeles Opera","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He's been hanging on to this secret for years.","title":"The Anonymous Lover — LA Opera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"L'amant anonyme — LA Opera","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2858678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiffany Townsend","original_name":"Tiffany Townsend","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Léontine","credit_id":"5fb2a684735205003f179616","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2858681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Stahley","original_name":"Robert Stahley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Valcour","credit_id":"5fb2a690d55e4d003ed4270b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael J.
