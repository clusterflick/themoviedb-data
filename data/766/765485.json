His propensity for women has landed him in the middle of a horrendous breakup, while her quest for self-discovery leads her into what might be direct contact with an avatar ('...a spiritual being sent to earth to teach us enlightenment'). Their friends appear throughout the film, offering real-life stories of irony, outrageousness, and late 20th century angst.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/tKehZh914HOw1zjX5ou6rrQMiE5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blues for the Avatar","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Schmidt","original_name":"Rick Schmidt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/daOMD2Kbjtjhxwglz0QJcfpP9XU.jpg","credit_id":"5fb41479b6cff1003bc885ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0115719","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1242,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tKehZh914HOw1zjX5ou6rrQMiE5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":828}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1996-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
