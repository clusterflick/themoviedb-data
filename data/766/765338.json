Entranced by her beauty, James risks everything to pursue an unattainable love… La Sylphide is not only the oldest of the classical ballets, but it also marks the start of dancing on pointe. The Bolshoi Theatre and Bolshoi Ballet in Cinema showcase Johan Kobborg’s production, which conveys the spirit of the ballet in this romantic tale. Anastasia Stashkevich appears as Sylph and Semyon Chudin as James.","popularity":0.3815,"poster_path":"/acERikAN1hd4ydSnev4RJBR3cn2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71870,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bolshoi
