On that day I wrote my first  message to my family regarding coronavirus, worried. I looked for  face masks, but there were none to be found anywhere. On February 4th  while in Lausanne for work, I managed to find masks near the train station  and bought what I thought would be enough at the time—ten masks—and  wore one for the first time on the train back to Milano. On February  27th the cases rose to 650 and I was unable to return to Bethlehem and  got stranded in Rome. On February 29th, cases rose to  1128 with 29 people dead. By March 7th, Italy was reporting more  deaths from the virus than any other country in the world. By March  19th the death toll in Italy surpassed China’s, and on March 24th  —when I filmed this—the daily death toll stood at 743.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1igpomKHm1FXFZPAy6ROcUwFucB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"March 24, 2020 (From My Window)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2535963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Jacir","original_name":"Emily Jacir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"5fb56ce23a48c5003c84303a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2535963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Jacir","original_name":"Emily Jacir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb56cd33a48c5003f85aab1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1igpomKHm1FXFZPAy6ROcUwFucB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
