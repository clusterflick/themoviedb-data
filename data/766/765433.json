CRUTCH examines Shannon’s controversial street performances as he exposes the hidden world of assumptions disabled people encounter in public, on a daily basis. While the film questions his early exploitation of strangers’ good Samaritan impulses, it also marvels at Shannon's ability to create solutions and empower others to navigate similar challenges.  From childhood “cripple” to international provocateur, CRUTCH is an emotional story of an artist’s struggle to be understood.","popularity":0.1068,"poster_path":"/duKiI6CNBmbUizEnYO0ip6QkDzO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crutch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3679028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Shannon","original_name":"Bill Shannon","popularity":0.1039,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"630a7b71da10f0007e398c71","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3049804,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick Bradford","original_name":"Nick Bradford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607498a5ca835400580bd5f9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2715559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chandler Evans","original_name":"Chandler Evans","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6074989065686e0057f3926b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sachi Cunningham","original_name":"Sachi Cunningham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607498611b1f3c00293d41cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":65319,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Betsy Stahl","original_name":"Betsy Stahl","popularity":0.0549,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b230c9d363e50061616914","department":"Production","job":"Co-Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1555402","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/248YiPoL4YudEXdKMdooJnnGSp3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1527,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f46JFkRvpGrtk0dOjRON4FOYEA9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1018},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/duKiI6CNBmbUizEnYO0ip6QkDzO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Crutch (trailer)","key":"2tYlsHgLL3Q","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-01T14:38:33.000Z","id":"6364221e07e281007a9db7a7"}]}}}
