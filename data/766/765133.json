For both the Ainu – and the peoples of the Amur river area on the mainland – the bear is an important spirit ancestor, and the annual ceremonial year used to revolve around ceremonies of the bear cult, where a bear is ritually killed and its spirit honoured.  Also documented are aspects of Ainu daily life in the 1930s: houses, boats, ornate swords, religious artifacts, and the elaborately tattooed mouths of the older women. There are two shortened versions (28 and later 25 minutes) of this documentary edited in the 1960s. Although shorter, these versions include some new images that Munro had not sent to England.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1931-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bear Festival in Chikabumi near Asahikawa-city","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Ainu Bear Ceremony","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Kinbun no kumaokuri girei","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Iyomande.
