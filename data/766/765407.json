Both characters are egg-shaped creatures with wide mouths that split their heads in half (like the Canadians from South Park), and move by rolling, hopping or swaying back and forth. They just mutter and 'talk' in a way that they seem to understand between the two of them. Weebl is the larger of the two, during the series it is revealed that Bob's small stature is due to a cheese overdose in the 1980s.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/dlrkV2Eid3WmFmQTmuB8GBPjNnP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wobbl And Bob","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/94o0c4VhNQCiRCGKlworm9rUXfx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":846,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dlrkV2Eid3WmFmQTmuB8GBPjNnP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2004-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
