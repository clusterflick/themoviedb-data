In this intimate travelogue, Doing visits the harbours where the mail ships stopped on their way to the Dutch Indies (Amsterdam, Genoa, Port Said) and films in Jakarta, Surabaya, Borneo and the oil-rich island of Tarakan. Fragments from his uncle’s letters, archival footage from the extensive Eye Filmmuseum collection and the director’s diary are combined in a fascinating mix.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9w9BKrvPX2uvI41qULuGRLot2zE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Voyage of Discovery to Tarakan","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Doing","original_name":"Karel Doing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9wgagOLeWNEXpjODlIPQMulXpWn.jpg","credit_id":"5fb33ea5d55e4d003dd42acf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1610,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9w9BKrvPX2uvI41qULuGRLot2zE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1073}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
