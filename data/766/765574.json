As the last stands of old-growth trees harboured in these valleys come under threat of logging, the climbing community faces the uncertain future of a place that has come to define their lives and legacies.  Confronted with the decision to fight for these last ancient trees and potentially lose access or look away as the valley is stripped for timber, On The Verge is a snapshot of outdoors culture in British Columbia. The way we reconcile industries that give us access to the wilderness with the destruction they cause. The desire to protect our backyard but keep it for ourselves at the same time. The importance of these places to the people who have shaped them and been shaped by them in return.","popularity":0.2192,"poster_path":"/lRwg1jkKZYZLQFovzKMNEhPMB0E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Verge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3457220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Munshaw","original_name":"Robin Munshaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6226dfe80a517c0047581239","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3457220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Munshaw","original_name":"Robin Munshaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6226df5dd2c0c1001c0dedd5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3457221,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robin Munshaw","original_name":"Robin Munshaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6226dfb49408ec004547cbdb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rJgon7IvzrxaAiiGyAeXKcKq1CR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lRwg1jkKZYZLQFovzKMNEhPMB0E.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":753},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3gisXBHE2knFqlk4sEEUSflXnM2.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":201008,"name":"rock climbing"},{"id":215522,"name":"british columbia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
