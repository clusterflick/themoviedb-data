After the opening, filmmaker Louis van Gasteren filmed how, in the distance, policemen began beating up a young man, seemingly without any provocation. This footage was shown that same evening on television.  Van Gasteren interviewed the victim, a 22-year-old student, who declared that he was walking in that direction because his ‘bicycle was there’. That became the title of this short film, in which Van Gasteren used slow motion to analyse the objectionable actions taken by the police.","popularity":0.1986,"poster_path":"/hChD2SmiZbDEX3Pp8TrKle3F62b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Because My Bike Was There...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2859823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Bermond","original_name":"Bob Bermond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb3f5e69b6e47003caade8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2859824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Wolkers","original_name":"Jan Wolkers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb3f5f2a22d3e003f0a9216","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1474106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis van Gasteren","original_name":"Louis van Gasteren","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/vlQEikWPOQFRUq8ZDxLwGb5cfhR.jpg","credit_id":"5fb3f5d6b6cff1003cc90ea3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hChD2SmiZbDEX3Pp8TrKle3F62b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":796,"name":"police brutality"},{"id":4108,"name":"protest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
