Having survived the Holocaust and then stayed in Germany after the war, it is the food they cook together that they remember their childhoods, maintain a bond to each other and answer questions of heritage, memory and identity. As the film follows them through their daily lives, a portrait emerges of two women with a light sense of humor, vivid stories, and a deep fondness for good food. Created by Oma's granddaughter Alexa, the film captures their ongoing struggle to retain a part of their past while remaining very much engaged in the present.","popularity":0.1635,"poster_path":"/qypoWp4Gs4rew86TGWbl9tyihUJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4748,"logo_path":"/bTMeosrSiKaTPmZiTYnSDZlin5d.png","name":"Oscilloscope","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oma & Bella","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Regina Karolinski","original_name":"Regina Karolinski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Oma","credit_id":"52fe4ab8c3a368484e16367f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bella Katz","original_name":"Bella Katz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bella","credit_id":"52fe4ab8c3a368484e163683","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexa Karolinski","original_name":"Alexa Karolinski","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ab8c3a368484e163689","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexa Karolinski","original_name":"Alexa Karolinski","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e389de743250f0017c40c41","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexa Karolinski","original_name":"Alexa Karolinski","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e389df5a7e3630019e989e5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37084,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Annette Focks","original_name":"Annette Focks","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/tB5F2MQNJjAq0wL8JTsvvzKzPCZ.jpg","credit_id":"5e389e1d37b3a90019b18851","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexa Karolinski","original_name":"Alexa Karolinski","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e389e2da7e3630019e98a62","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexa Karolinski","original_name":"Alexa Karolinski","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e389e3c98f1f1001807bdc4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2528903,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guenter Berghaus","original_name":"Guenter Berghaus","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e389e614ca676001453ef39","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2078696","wikidata_id":"Q61486023","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eWeBSzbr9iGF1hs3cTQMozd2Deg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qypoWp4Gs4rew86TGWbl9tyihUJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pgeuAXlDC2Rqs1U5w4E44VRI2Wr.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OMA & BELLA Trailer","key":"mEA6dul2rAc","published_at":"2012-05-02T16:20:02.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6ebc3a3685448008f64"}]}}}
