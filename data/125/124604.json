He's serious about his part-time job as a clerk for an insurance company, and he also acts, with small parts under his belt in commercials and experimental films. An agent finds his serious innocence perfect for a part as an odd bellman. Before his screen test, he volunteers for a day at a hotel. At his screen test, his inability to see the comic center of the scene makes him perfect for the part. Back at work, women co-workers tease him, and then he's off to the countryside to play a vet in a government film about myxomatosis in rabbits. Can anything break through his serious view of reality?","popularity":0.301,"poster_path":"/7VLiuHZO8Q2eSTpf2zMdiyyvKsg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sépia
