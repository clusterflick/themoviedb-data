In the summer of 2005, he decided to try and run the full marathon race on the next Belgrade Marathon, in the spring of 2006. This film depicts his struggle to train, lose weight, learn the tactics and eventually win the race. His family doubts that such feat is possible while friends both encourage him and discourage him to pull it off. Suddenly the whole marathon run becomes a metaphor for everyday struggles in post-Communist Belgrade.","popularity":0.3206,"poster_path":"/xBNZdpBwSWj1akkVdH7QiUw1JyM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65812,"logo_path":null,"name":"Starhill","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":94002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visionary Thinking","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2008-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Become a Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"How to Become a Hero","type":"International (English title)"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Pos na gineis iroas","type":"Greece (TV title)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Lewis","original_name":"Carl Lewis","popularity":0.1562,"profile_path":"/XOkU3h9tD9NyKxprRNkCbkN3K8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4ab5c3a368484e162c49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050172,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mladen Matičević","original_name":"Mladen Matičević","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4ab5c3a368484e162c4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandar Srećković 'Kubura'","original_name":"Aleksandar Srećković 'Kubura'","popularity":0.1962,"profile_path":"/vyaDdv6LK5XOkIrcRJtEy3vdT2p.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4ab5c3a368484e162c51","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Goran Terzić","original_name":"Goran Terzić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4ab5c3a368484e162c55","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050172,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mladen Matičević","original_name":"Mladen Matičević","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ab5c3a368484e162c3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050172,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mladen Matičević","original_name":"Mladen Matičević","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ab5c3a368484e162c45","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080602,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sandra Keser","original_name":"Sandra Keser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ab5c3a368484e162c5b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050172,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mladen Matičević","original_name":"Mladen Matičević","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ab5c3a368484e162c61","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dragan Petrović 'Pele'","original_name":"Dragan Petrović 'Pele'","popularity":0.3544,"profile_path":"/yZQuLEwaxzZ9XdSlxM8DmKvBlyy.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ab5c3a368484e162c67","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080603,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Novica Jankov","original_name":"Novica Jankov","popularity":0.133,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ab5c3a368484e162c6d","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080604,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Suzana Matičević","original_name":"Suzana Matičević","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ab5c3a368484e162c73","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080605,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Zoran Petrović","original_name":"Zoran Petrović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ab5c3a368484e162c79","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080606,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Damjan Radovanović","original_name":"Damjan Radovanović","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ab5c3a368484e162c7f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0829211","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xBNZdpBwSWj1akkVdH7QiUw1JyM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7248,"name":"marathon"},{"id":195337,"name":"belgrade"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
