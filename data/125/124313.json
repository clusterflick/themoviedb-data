(It may date to their mother's leaving the family.) Martin is philosophical, romantic, and poetic: he dreams of being the son of a shark; he holds tight to a book about goldfish his mother gave him. In both halting and wild ways, he tries to court Marie, a neighbor girl. Simon, with a pocketknife and an intractable will, seems more dangerous to others. What, on earth, is there for these children-becoming-men?","popularity":0.3633,"poster_path":"/fXCxdqyDnPz0wcXrep4fduVOKKj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95456,"logo_path":null,"name":"In Visible
