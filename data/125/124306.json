Over ten months, we follow the mad Artaud from his cruel coaching of an actress in his \"theatre of cruelty\" to his semi-friendship with Prevel who buys him drugs and hangs on his every word. Meanwhile, Prevel divides his time between Jany, his blond, young, drug-hazed mistress, and Rolande, his dark-haired, long-suffering wife, who has a child during this time. Cruelty, neglect, poverty, egoism, madness, and the pursuit of art mix on the Left Bank.","popularity":0.2489,"poster_path":"/wDqebKxUMKbIzLKTKeCLXpK5QFW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2695,"logo_path":null,"name":"Archipel 33>35","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11359,"logo_path":"/aqWJRi66t2oMPMmC60CdK9I3WQd.png","name":"France 2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":153395,"logo_path":"/oVCO4P9C1pEyO38OfclcsMHHT7U.png","name":"La Sept","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":47608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laura Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1993-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Life and Times with Antonin Artaud","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sami Frey","original_name":"Sami Frey","popularity":0.4676,"profile_path":"/7yb6JIdlMNWxc6SKhRVxauxa9wW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Antonin Artaud","credit_id":"52fe4aa8c3a368484e16032b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Barbé","original_name":"Marc Barbé","popularity":0.1744,"profile_path":"/wx6mwxsSrAZj3PAg8PkUSAQlTbo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"626f70b668ff7000525175fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":262075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Jézéquel","original_name":"Julie Jézéquel","popularity":0.2993,"profile_path":"/gT8xNBN2xhP2JqN44qklXqUshHK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"626f70bf68ff700068e1091c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1118225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valérie Jeannet","original_name":"Valérie Jeannet","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/n3PurPWHLFKAHBHxkcBheedfkCg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"626f70c509ed8f0068ff6f18","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Mordillat","original_name":"Gérard Mordillat","popularity":0.1308,"profile_path":"/eYcxt9h1FlD4bQyQ9ycuxwEBekV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4aa8c3a368484e160327","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0106810","wikidata_id":"Q6945858","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":945,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wDqebKxUMKbIzLKTKeCLXpK5QFW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":630},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lQQ8odh4KuXaKGOBuVSGrAIoGim.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qm42DfF0kfLSo4AUDqB63qvU9I1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (FIFF)","release_date":"1993-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
