Ned's Atomic Dustbin in Concert","overview":"Shot in June 2002 at JB's in Dudley, the spiritual home of the band, us Ned's fans have had a patient 16 month wait for this DVD to be released.  It was truly worth the wait though, this is a great DVD that captures an excellent performance by the Ned's. Although not the original line up, this does not detract. Since 2000, Mat Cheslin & Rat have been replaced by ex-Groundswell members Andy King and Martin Warlow respectively.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6ZNtbsv8G2ezKMd01ayI5LDv9sR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shoot The Neds!
