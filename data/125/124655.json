The chill of each killing drives Angel into the arms of anonymous lovers -- a desperate attempt for affection -- but her ex-boyfriend George is watching ... In a demented rage he stalks her through her steamy video-arcade reality. But when the game is over and the high score is counted, will Angel be able to walk away?","popularity":1.7208,"poster_path":"/cLO6VhYxbeAOdlEijJ0VHQVpTOV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1009,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crown International Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"...a deadly game!","title":"The Silencer","video":false,"vote_average":4.667,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Silencer - Sie tötet lautlos","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Ángel, placer mortal","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Angel - Kuolemanenkeli","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"La professionnelle","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynette Walden","original_name":"Lynette Walden","popularity":0.2995,"profile_path":"/yYxnW0QunhKWlMxYbLHyDN3LybR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Angelica","credit_id":"52fe4ab0c3a368484e161e27","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Mulkey","original_name":"Chris Mulkey","popularity":1.1598,"profile_path":"/fNsKtr9iTSEFoHknI6dJm0hC6qH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"George","credit_id":"52fe4ab0c3a368484e161e2b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":168140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Ganus","original_name":"Paul Ganus","popularity":0.2092,"profile_path":"/8kUA4cwSMBFkUsUz21RjfVNM9er.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tony","credit_id":"52fe4ab1c3a368484e161e2f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaime Gomez","original_name":"Jaime Gomez","popularity":0.3019,"profile_path":"/j7pTqqYGuQTAgcP393TQBwxwPi2.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Drew","credit_id":"5cead4159251414398b9af85","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morton Downey, Jr.","original_name":"Morton Downey, Jr.","popularity":0.2284,"profile_path":"/5nfamUS46jyV3MLlgCYaZUu4As4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Michael Keating","credit_id":"52fe4ab1c3a368484e161e37","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1237679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brook Susan Parker","original_name":"Brook Susan Parker","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/4KnYwFR3PJg71pHWCCLQhjSOwPL.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Didi","credit_id":"52fe4ab1c3a368484e161e3b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Shannon","original_name":"George Shannon","popularity":0.3613,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"C.H.
