Despite their band name, Eagles of Death Metal is not a death metal band. Hughes stated that a friend was introducing Josh Homme to the death metal genre. When he played a song by the Polish band Vader and made a claim that the song was within the death metal genre, Homme then referred to Vader as \"The Eagles of Death Metal\". After hearing this phrase, he wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like.[1] In a 2003 interview Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of \"bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and Canned Heat vocals.\" Jesse Hughes is known by fans for his enthusiastic interaction with audiences at live performances.","popularity":0.3024,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eagles of Death Metal Live at Hurricane Festival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse Hughes","original_name":"Jesse Hughes","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/aSHg6gUe31ovHPxdoAP2qrfrIfF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4aacc3a368484e160feb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Troy Van Leeuwen","original_name":"Troy Van Leeuwen","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4aacc3a368484e160fef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":215532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian O'Connor","original_name":"Brian O'Connor","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4aacc3a368484e160ff3","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
