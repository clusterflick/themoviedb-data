The grandson of a Chinese railroad laborer embarks on a romantic, but ultimately doomed, quest to save this railroad from being sold for scrap. His love of trains finds him working as a railroad-man, instead of at his father's profitable business. He manages to locate a wealthy eccentric investor to help him acquire the railroad, but its financial inviability makes this a quixotic reprieve, at best. The film also portrays the anti-Asian racism present in America at the conclusion of World War II.","popularity":1.0226,"poster_path":"/2CXekUPuVCyoCRZtWwbLtSbXioa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30256,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stark Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":4631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Antarctic Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":2765,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blurco","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Color of a Brisk and Leaping Day","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":162574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeri Arredondo","original_name":"Jeri Arredondo","popularity":0.1427,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nancy","credit_id":"52fe4ab1c3a368484e162005","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Gibson","original_name":"Henry Gibson","popularity":1.0107,"profile_path":"/2Py2ZzFfTobPIHEKRYuWHhxRDqF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Albert Robinson","credit_id":"52fe4ab1c3a368484e162009","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Stipe","original_name":"Michael Stipe","popularity":0.2504,"profile_path":"/ooBrKtelltirieu14MmxW7cLS4X.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Skeeter","credit_id":"52fe4ab1c3a368484e16200d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Bokyun Chun","original_name":"Alexandra Bokyun Chun","popularity":0.2237,"profile_path":"/eNgfe3wBJpj5ZFW42J9cCohruPx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Angela","credit_id":"56e4a8469251411fef0000a1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Boyce","original_name":"Alan Boyce","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/pTzm2zwWfKXKFoe1Dl5DQZ1WSUy.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffa13b5706e56003e41c088","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":96919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Munch","original_name":"Christopher Munch","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ab1c3a368484e162001","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":96919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Munch","original_name":"Christopher Munch","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e4a819c3a3685a92004636","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043954,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Donald Rosenfeld","original_name":"Donald Rosenfeld","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e4a809c3a3685a96004b9f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589977,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rob Sweeney","original_name":"Rob Sweeney","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1992d30e0a261f8500b48a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22115,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Sperling","original_name":"Andrea Sperling","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/9Fn05RK4V2RZrsUtwtprpe0Xrse.jpg","credit_id":"5b1993110e0a261f9f00b4d8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0115925","wikidata_id":"Q5148627","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2CXekUPuVCyoCRZtWwbLtSbXioa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1125}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
