In the story, he at first takes up with August (Helge Jordal), a charming trader who is at least half con-man. After trailing along with him for a while, he decides that August is not a man he wants to model his life after. He becomes acquainted with and falls in love with Lovise Margrete (Marika Lagercrantz) a woman living alone on a sheep farm. She has feelings for him also, but she remains true to her missing husband and their acquaintance does not progress to being a full-fledged romance. It is not until her husband returns to her life that any resolution to Edevart's frustration (which lasts for years) can be achieved.","popularity":0.2426,"poster_path":"/3tl3mQn6RBLbSgbuqGfH3743xKe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1989-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wanderers","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trond Peter Stamsø Munch","original_name":"Trond Peter Stamsø Munch","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":"/Aaw9f1qW25OLqPFmC7OjWE84UVu.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Edevart","credit_id":"5df4359cfac502001185d6c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marika Lagercrantz","original_name":"Marika Lagercrantz","popularity":0.5793,"profile_path":"/ya50fGUyUD1PfCopwgwr79O1O9w.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lovise Magrete","credit_id":"52fe4aa9c3a368484e16052d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helge Jordal","original_name":"Helge Jordal","popularity":0.1524,"profile_path":"/qKDDocxfvzWu808NY6g0ykqxCft.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"August","credit_id":"52fe4aa9c3a368484e160531","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Espen Skjønberg","original_name":"Espen Skjønberg","popularity":0.0565,"profile_path":"/oBXYZ8HMWnMjV5M7oknlY2jtjoR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Knoff","credit_id":"52fe4aa9c3a368484e160535","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ola Solum","original_name":"Ola Solum","popularity":0.0537,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4aa9c3a368484e16050d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ola Solum","original_name":"Ola Solum","popularity":0.0537,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4aa9c3a368484e160513","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138854,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lars Saabye Christensen","original_name":"Lars Saabye Christensen","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4aa9c3a368484e160519","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":416576,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Knut Hamsun","original_name":"Knut Hamsun","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":"/aPGrCCJ2xKrwhjSntc7lhUshFT.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4aa9c3a368484e16051f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":575484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Lindgren","original_name":"Hans Lindgren","popularity":0.185,"profile_path":"/nStyh9T9GVTsrDrq8nsMZoVyLWr.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4aa9c3a368484e160525","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0097709","wikidata_id":"Q11983105","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5RbMkcRWqi5oTZQAkILUhrC9RdT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mEvCZKW0weC1aGNtRhxDUlczExZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/3tl3mQn6RBLbSgbuqGfH3743xKe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"no","note":"","release_date":"1989-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
