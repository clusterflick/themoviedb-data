Probably best known for his oft-quoted (and misunderstood) 1960s phrase wherein Dr.Leary encouraged everyone to \"turn on, tune in and drop out\", the filmmakers sought to capture the real man behind the legend; vox-pops with friends, colleges and family pepper the storyline that made-up the multi-faceted man who was author, psychologist, teacher, guru, fugitive-from-justice and dignified humorist. We see him in his experimental 1960s, the hippie 70s, his thoughtful 80s and the futuristic 90s. Overall a very satisfying documentary about this extraordinary man. Ever the Professor, we see his musings on life &amp; death and, after succumbing to the inevitable, we witness the (somewhat macabre) after-death cryogenic storage of his severed head for his optimistic, future generations to do with what they may.","popularity":0.1054,"poster_path":"/sePpVmo0v5w2UCZiXqQ8xpo7VHU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Timothy Leary's Dead","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":173653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Davids","original_name":"Paul Davids","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ab6c3a368484e163069","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0117917","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n39R7igIjTJeW0LkGPpTU4HkWGE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sePpVmo0v5w2UCZiXqQ8xpo7VHU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1418,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hS0tIqfD0vCaQAWHH7RxBoKhuwt.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
