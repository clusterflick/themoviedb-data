From the moment in each episode when the phone rings and the Wonder Pets dramatically burst into their operetta-like singing--\"The phone! The phone is ringing!\"--young viewers are hooked. These creative stories bring together preschoolers' favorite characters--the Wonder Pets and beloved nursery rhyme and fairy tale icons--with humor, an irreverent attitude, and empowering problem-solving skills. All of which are bound to lead to happily ever after.  Two additional episodes in which the Wonder Pets save the griffin, rooster, panda, and mouse, plus a music video.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wonder Pets!: Save the Nursery Rhyme","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
