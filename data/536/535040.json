Parts of the Red Army are waging an uncompromising struggle with basmachi in Central Asia.  The film tells about the formation of the character of the young Kyrgyz hunter Djura, who found himself in a swirling whirlpool of revolutionary events that swept the Pamirs. It shows the hard way from a simple young hunter, entangled in centuries of prejudice, to a conscious, seasoned in many battles with the Basmachi mature fighter, who believed in the great ideas of the revolution.","popularity":0.5776,"poster_path":"/3625bxs3GZCb2Y18D6EgbTxj9UQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40456,"logo_path":"/7aU4xI1sq3ZGXbNsX6uP0Z6VYlU.png","name":"Kirghizfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet
