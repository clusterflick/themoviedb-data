Is it just the interaction of time, space, particles and forces? A hallucination created by billions of neurons in our body? A mathematical machine?  Are there other realities, universes or dimensions?  Dimensions is entertainment made and inspired by science and discovery. A rollercoaster ride of visuals and music that takes audiences on a fascinating journey. The show transports audiences to awe-inspiring worlds where they find the time and space to think and feel about the big questions of our time.  What sticks is a strong feeling that there may be unexplored realms and worlds in us, and around us, which influence us even more strongly than what we already know and understand.","popularity":0.0243,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dimensions - Once Upon Our Reality","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2082301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johannes Kraas","original_name":"Johannes Kraas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b45cf9ac3a3684f22003324","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2082303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rocco Helmchen","original_name":"Rocco Helmchen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b45cfb4c3a3684f1e00335b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"DimensionsFulldome","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
