The reception in Argos, more than ten years later, was icy. Annoyed by the double indelicacy of her husband, Clytemnestra, his wife who had meanwhile become the mistress of Aegisthus, killed him with the help of her lover. Aegisthus then became the regent and ensured the prosperity of the city alongside his mistress, the widowed queen. But Electra, one of the daughters of Agamemnon, has always foreseen the murder and adultery of her mother. Solitary, wild, she lives in the royal palace awaiting the return of Orestes, her brother who has taken refuge since childhood with an uncle, in order to take revenge. Electra can begin, the crimes of the Atreides family continue quietly, as planned.","popularity":0.3153,"poster_path":"/lwb1VKCVn7vXwLrHJZB2wq9Pshw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71436,"logo_path":"/acBmHgTZuEUw7gtezSgRLxRF1Y6.png","name":"Editions Montparnasse","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1972-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Électre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Chaumette","original_name":"François Chaumette","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/oCP8GqcuX8JYQ2Z2NEQVKFJSXFu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Egisthe","credit_id":"5b4a305bc3a36823e00114fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Duchaussoy","original_name":"Michel Duchaussoy","popularity":0.4662,"profile_path":"/5HuD9Y3hYUKgfomk93DMRS4G4pT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The gardener","credit_id":"5b4a3069c3a36823ed015204","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":540719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Ducaux","original_name":"Annie Ducaux","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":"/9IigrnkePIhj4bbJm0DewxVdXm2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Clytemnestra","credit_id":"5b4a308e9251417d1e011c96","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Gence","original_name":"Denise Gence","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":"/9sJm5DAvnwjAVrJ3NYcFLOWsHo3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Narsès woman","credit_id":"5b4a30abc3a36823e001155a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Aumont","original_name":"Michel Aumont","popularity":0.3459,"profile_path":"/4hplpAVRi4nxSTWwQcmH2Ok2AXF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"President","credit_id":"5efdc5e67b7b4d00355a3d82","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1472634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul-Émile Deiber","original_name":"Paul-Émile Deiber","popularity":0.1114,"profile_path":"/b2Y47j0X35pr0zjijjS4lPdXfV6.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"The beggar","credit_id":"5efdc6327b7b4d00355a3dc8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Salviat","original_name":"Catherine Salviat","popularity":0.0753,"profile_path":"/xCy6W2LjTadDXZSVMtLWWzo1fJm.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"A great Eumenide","credit_id":"5efdc64f5437f50036933762","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Dux","original_name":"Pierre Dux","popularity":0.1641,"profile_path":"/4uCrUGXOZTwq36f6GN6gcwPhdob.jpg","credit_id":"5b4a30dc9251417d240125c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Dux","original_name":"Pierre Dux","popularity":0.1641,"profile_path":"/4uCrUGXOZTwq36f6GN6gcwPhdob.jpg","credit_id":"5b4a30f29251417d27012eb4","department":"Directing","job":"Action Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":102863,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tony Aubin","original_name":"Tony Aubin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4a311fc3a36823d8010fbd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223227,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean Giraudoux","original_name":"Jean Giraudoux","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efdc5615437f50036933676","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2698961,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernard Girod","original_name":"Bernard Girod","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efdc56da76ac50035fd7bac","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384701,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Georges Wakhévitch","original_name":"Georges Wakhévitch","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5efdc5a4a76ac50037fd7849","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0335071","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lwb1VKCVn7vXwLrHJZB2wq9Pshw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
