Aerial views give evidence of the conversion of the old Toronto into the new--the city with towering skyscrapers, teeming traffic arteries, vast industrial developments and far-reaching residential areas housing over a million people.  Toronto's mid-century progress is also Canada's, as manifested in the building of Canada's first subway, and in the bustle of the nation's greatest trading centre--the Toronto Stock Exchange.","popularity":0.0985,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toronto Boom Town","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312178,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leslie McFarlane","original_name":"Leslie McFarlane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6465ae62006b010189572de3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312178,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leslie McFarlane","original_name":"Leslie McFarlane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6465ae67c3514c00e5dbd2e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1951-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
