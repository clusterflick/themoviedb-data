Philip proposes and discovers that Judith has only been kidding him along. He returns angrily to Arizona, and the elder Endicott, accompanied by his daughter, follows him west. With her father's permission, Richard \"kidnaps\" Judith and takes her to a deserted Indian cliff dwelling, where she must cook and care for him. Bert Durland, Judith's fianc√©, follows after her, and his Indian guide steals all of the horses. Judith and Bert and Philip start back to civilization across the desert, and Bert goes berserk from the heat. They are rescued by cowboys, and Judith returns east, \"kidnaping\" Philip and taking him with her.","popularity":0.4778,"poster_path":"/wrRpCXpTQAsCTUeOiVpjHTkVXm2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33333,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Scenes in Natural Color","title":"The Water Hole","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Holt","original_name":"Jack Holt","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/4xfh3Mlpqx8tZ991rhVTov0ILtN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Philip Randolph","credit_id":"5b4b8fb50e0a26453e02926d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Carroll","original_name":"Nancy Carroll","popularity":0.1385,"profile_path":"/ptkv8zyMZDgU8uJv8TWON0ZibIy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Judith Endicott","credit_id":"5b4b8fd49251417d27029a75","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Boles","original_name":"John Boles","popularity":0.1812,"profile_path":"/eVu8Tzdi3UYrCApUW221CSXoAHt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bert Durland","credit_id":"5b4b8ff80e0a26453402940d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"C.
