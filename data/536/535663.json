The journey, an 8,000 mile Pacific crossing from New Zealand to Patagonia, with a stop in Antarctica. Unlike all the other boats heading to the Southern Ocean, Infinity is no ice-reinforced super-yacht crewed by professional sailors; rather, Infinity lives in the moment and sails on a whim. What can be found in abundance on board is blood, sweat, enthusiasm, risk tolerance, disdain for authority, and an ample supply of alcohol â€“ all in all a mad voyage of reckless adventure just for the sheer joy of it. Along the way the crew will battle a hurricane of ice in the Ross Sea, assist the radical environmental group Sea Shepherd in their fight with illegal whalers, and tear every sail they have. At the heart of their journey is a quest for awe and a sense of wonder with the raw power of the natural world.","popularity":0.69,"poster_path":"/1trknzeXZrEDrJeX2Ijj6NKqxMJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of a small group of modern seafaring gypsies, following them as they strike out across the largest expanse of uninhabited geography on earth, in search of adventure, awe and whatever else lies at the far side of the world.","title":"Sea Gypsies: The Far Side of the World","video":false,"vote_average":8.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2084110,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nico Edwards","original_name":"Nico Edwards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b49861ec3a36823de009e79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5656006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Lqjk9VasXRWG2cUd7TzIpmGwDr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1trknzeXZrEDrJeX2Ijj6NKqxMJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v6JN4G7gsIEebfwYi2iBowJknE2.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":658,"name":"sea"},{"id":3799,"name":"ship"},{"id":2041,"name":"island"},{"id":270,"name":"ocean"},{"id":3342,"name":"yacht"},{"id":3180,"name":"sailing"},{"id":8083,"name":"pacific"},{"id":12988,"name":"pirate"},{"id":14728,"name":"antarctica"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":33577,"name":"environment"},{"id":189092,"name":"journey"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sea Gypsies: The Far Side of the World","key":"k3rJiDN7cao","published_at":"2015-10-26T06:27:55.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b49816a0e0a26453200853a"}]}}}
