History having disappeared, carried away by the extinction of men, machines tell stories with the images that men have bequeathed to them. Like those of this narrator who could not, him or anyone, survive the final virus but who left on a hard drive images shot from the time he was still living. His travels, family, love. Life. This life and its memory that our computer heirs sing about make it look nostalgic, a human feeling that we did not know they were programmed to feel.","popularity":0.0617,"poster_path":"/cmNibTaMxylDDRe1XYWUBMOmaVc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Was On Earth That I Knew Joy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68820,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Para One","original_name":"Para One","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":"/2c8750ml8RwnakO5lv6zCxUFhjd.jpg","credit_id":"670403f3cc904f12d913a20d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":1202,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cmNibTaMxylDDRe1XYWUBMOmaVc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":796},{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1202,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lkIZQTtULzpX6KJurci3e5S8GG5.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":798}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"Fren","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
