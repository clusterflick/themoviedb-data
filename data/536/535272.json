Don’t watch this off-beat jukebox cartoon expecting any conventional soccer action. Equal parts Disney, Dali and Duchamp, this abstract mix of black and white photos and alternative comix style animation is accompanied by a medley of doo-wop classics and documentary soundbites.  The film is certainly an extreme departure for those familiar with the more conventional output of the Halas & Batchelor studio, best known for their feature-length version of George Orwell’s Animal Farm (1954). Paul Vester was one of a number of sixties art school graduates that brought a mix of pop art and illustration influences to the company whilst it was undergoing a brief change in its ownership. As a warning, in keeping with its progressive, adult style there is some brief nudity at the end of the film.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/6EClR7YzQodm7oqS4wi3HFlKxQW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Halas and Batchelor Cartoon Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1971-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Football Freaks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1059912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Vester","original_name":"Paul Vester","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a4e261b9744200b5208cb3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1059912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Vester","original_name":"Paul Vester","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b462735925141690400687b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1059912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Vester","original_name":"Paul Vester","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4625c892514168e800777d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1555554,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dick Arnall","original_name":"Dick Arnall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b462719c3a3684f15007e7b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6EClR7YzQodm7oqS4wi3HFlKxQW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
