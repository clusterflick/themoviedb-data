Just before our working-class pair arrives at the party, the hostess is called away to see to an ill dog. Thelma tries to behave in a refined way, but Patsy, with a head full of practical jokes and a bra filled with trick gadgets, turns the party on its head. The butler calls the hostess back to her home. Is Thelma and Patsy's moment in high society coming to a crashing end?","popularity":0.5082,"poster_path":"/whM3JasHl4ycPUdFj3MFdVWt151.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soup and Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thelma Todd","original_name":"Thelma Todd","popularity":0.2588,"profile_path":"/pXImIsfL2n0AXFB5fPWj3nb7fKK.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Miss Thelma Todd","credit_id":"5413e03ec3a3687dc8000f83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patsy Kelly","original_name":"Patsy Kelly","popularity":0.3081,"profile_path":"/sef7GYVzHFNUYz9E6SoR7A2Ygc6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Miss Patsy Kelly","credit_id":"5413e04fc3a3687dc8000f86","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1181455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Gale","original_name":"Gladys Gale","popularity":0.1165,"profile_path":"/upPDR7pSbP5ENXAVYZ8dFCUvJLl.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Mrs. Dukesbery","credit_id":"5a687fba9251411bc100a3dd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Gilbert","original_name":"Billy Gilbert","popularity":0.467,"profile_path":"/xEqQLDrbtY2TlANNbXwXPG3ZDyK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Count Gustav","credit_id":"5413e09a0e0a261992001000","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Barclay","original_name":"Don Barclay","popularity":0.1223,"profile_path":"/jVKPE16JHrMa5H5VDyG4z05rK5M.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"First Butler, with Knee Britches","credit_id":"5413e0ae0e0a2619a1000f2c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1186116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Alexander","original_name":"Ernie Alexander","popularity":0.1391,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dog Hospital Intern (uncredited)","credit_id":"5413e0c8c3a3687dae000f6d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baldwin Cooke","original_name":"Baldwin Cooke","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/3Y5eiCLbDpCEhaL0HFpoJFpYsRn.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Fourth Butler, with Soup (uncredited)","credit_id":"54c230ca92514124890036d7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Hall","original_name":"Charlie Hall","popularity":0.2577,"profile_path":"/huLPhEhh8pO9v0gSJb7HVB76GRZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Second Butler, Announcing Guests (uncredited)","credit_id":"5413e1100e0a2619a1000f4b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":195086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alphonse Martell","original_name":"Alphonse Martell","popularity":0.178,"profile_path":"/qNiH6gjtc905FZlsMYJVfOrcxIJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Hemingway, Third Butler (uncredited)","credit_id":"5413e125c3a3687dae000f89","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Mayne","original_name":"Eric Mayne","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/3JpQliE6d59qxh3QGZmgdJ4E9Ue.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Man receiving electric permanent / Fainting Dinner Guest (uncredited)","credit_id":"5413e1430e0a261992001025","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1269196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellinor Vanderveer","original_name":"Ellinor Vanderveer","popularity":0.3314,"profile_path":"/ynfcRdgYvMQ8OELK6AnS22R4zNs.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Society Matron at Beauty Salon (uncredited)","credit_id":"5413e1570e0a26199b000f9c","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gus Meins","original_name":"Gus Meins","popularity":0.2518,"profile_path":"/fYTlxmsvCnrA4uHycgxgZoTNTYr.jpg","credit_id":"5413e16d0e0a2619a1000f57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0025815","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/whM3JasHl4ycPUdFj3MFdVWt151.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1934-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
