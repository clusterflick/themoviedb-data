Aburdist humor is the hallmark of this pseudo-scientific description of biting, chewing, swallowing, and digesting food. The on-screen narrator begins with teeth, \"little sentinels\" as he calls them, and the tongue. Then it's on to the stomach: he describes the stomach's workings as if it were an office or a factory. He uses an illustration of the side view of a human torso, with mouth, esophagus, and stomach visible, saying it's a photograph of a man with a visible digestive tract.","popularity":0.2598,"poster_path":"/plV3AFqy7krTK4wgH1ccc9PYcrl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Romance of Digestion","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Benchley","original_name":"Robert Benchley","popularity":0.1837,"profile_path":"/qXJtEUZW459w8hKEcvo4FauhOBy.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Joe Doakes","credit_id":"54157003c3a3684d060017cd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix E.
