The story takes place in a small village in Italy in October of 1922, on the eve of the fascist \"March on Rome\", in which King Victor Emanuel III was persuaded to consign power to Benito Mussolini. Gianfranco Giachetti is Dr. Cardini, a doctor at the local psychiatric hospital, where a strike has been called by the local socialists. Cardini turns to the fascists to help avert the strike. His son Roberto (Mino Doro) rounds up fascist friends to fight those aligned with the strikers and the town's socialists.","popularity":0.5895,"poster_path":"/n7K16oWeXXm3i5Z8wtQzZjXJj1M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156273,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fauno Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1934-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Guard","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Old Guard","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianfranco Giachetti","original_name":"Gianfranco Giachetti","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dott.
