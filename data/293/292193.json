None of his efforts to get another job succeed and he is forced to use what he has, including an old bicycle, in order to provide for his family. With the help of his \"black sheep\" brother, a bicycle shop owner and a pro-cyclist, Francois makes some life-changing discoveries about his life, career and faith in God. Although a fictional story, Break Away, was inspired by true events around the recession that left people without work. The message brings hope and offers practical and Biblical solutions in a very entertaining way.","popularity":0.1386,"poster_path":"/b4CcHxifKdQM5WDvWAzIgINJQhu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2012-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Break Away","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Break Away","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568106,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frans Cronjé","original_name":"Frans Cronjé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Francois Fouché","credit_id":"5ac1e1d292514126be018de3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leoné Pienaar","original_name":"Leoné Pienaar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Michelle Fouché","credit_id":"5ac1e2009251412712018ab0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1853008,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Etienne Janse van Rensburg","original_name":"Etienne Janse van Rensburg","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Juan Fouché","credit_id":"5ac1e29992514126b00174f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morné Theunissen","original_name":"Morné Theunissen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Eli Pavoncelli","credit_id":"5ac1e2cdc3a3682d9a017f05","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568106,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frans Cronjé","original_name":"Frans Cronjé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac1e33a9251412712018c48","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568106,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frans Cronjé","original_name":"Frans Cronjé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac1e32fc3a3682d35018d45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morné Theunissen","original_name":"Morné Theunissen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac1e3a60e0a260c2a01a5e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568106,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frans Cronjé","original_name":"Frans Cronjé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac1e35bc3a3682d35018d69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morné Theunissen","original_name":"Morné Theunissen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac1e3830e0a260c1401879b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morné Theunissen","original_name":"Morné Theunissen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac1e3990e0a260c4a01aba5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2770694","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i9PUtFvlCy503liMmq6Q7roI0Q6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sY9OQgSSh9si6TiZZKolZToxRyQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b4CcHxifKdQM5WDvWAzIgINJQhu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":253695,"name":"christian film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
