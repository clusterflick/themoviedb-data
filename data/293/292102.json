A group of researchers appear to have made contact with an entity by the name of Philip. It is possible that Philip was not really a ghost and that the strange events were just the result of manifestations from group consciousness. Maybe it was all just the result of psychokinesis or a big trick the researchers played on themselves. At the core of the investigation are belief, immortality and science.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conjuring Phillip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
