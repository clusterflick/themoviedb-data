His lover Sabine, who is ironically the wife of his superior, chief commissioner Hartmut, is found murdered in her sister, Martha's home. Benno is summoned to the scene in this murder case. Hartmut can not manage the investigation as a husband and thus transfers the case to Benno. All others come under suspicion for this: his wife, his father-in-law and the widower. Everyone had a motive, everyone was at the scene. But even Benno himself comes as a perpetrator in question: On the morning of the murder his lover had put an end to him.","popularity":0.2149,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":25443,"logo_path":null,"name":"ABC Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eine folgenschwere Affäre","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Karl","original_name":"Fritz Karl","popularity":0.3064,"profile_path":"/jvkg9ugmuCjAM4OOQyEmIeiVWn1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Benno Söder","credit_id":"5414bcf50e0a2619a4002816","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharina Böhm","original_name":"Katharina Böhm","popularity":0.5561,"profile_path":"/7xaGl1I95pamxJt9kdgbt7vb1FT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Andrea Söder","credit_id":"5414bd210e0a2619a1002732","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Simonischek","original_name":"Peter Simonischek","popularity":0.254,"profile_path":"/5Dw34hpB8dasodGZHRngZ3cmESb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ewald Feldmeier","credit_id":"5414bd360e0a2619920027df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silke Bodenbender","original_name":"Silke Bodenbender","popularity":0.2434,"profile_path":"/vhL0YaHSls4LUILlqdNM9B5sm8l.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Irene Schmoldt","credit_id":"5414bd460e0a2619920027e1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Fitz","original_name":"Michael Fitz","popularity":0.1908,"profile_path":"/cG1NAqTgpjlCZeV7BlVPN1ykjO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hartmut Henkel","credit_id":"5414bd580e0a26198300286a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Martinek","original_name":"Lisa Martinek","popularity":0.255,"profile_path":"/dF72ax2dja8lNVoMytj6ZdTqwlF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sabine Henkel","credit_id":"5414bd690e0a2619a4002826","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Enlen","original_name":"Martin Enlen","popularity":0.1472,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5414bcddc3a3687dc5002873","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1373548,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Detlef Michel","original_name":"Detlef Michel","popularity":0.0549,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543813041a561336c5b2748","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24188,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Monika Abspacher","original_name":"Monika Abspacher","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65438134ed2ac2011e4c2efd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49764,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Philipp Timme","original_name":"Philipp Timme","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543813b9cc67b013a2f9a7e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465896,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eberhard Jost","original_name":"Eberhard Jost","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654381549cc67b013a2f9a8b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3212939,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Bennert","original_name":"Jan Bennert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543815d41a561336d8301b6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4352978,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Günther Gries","original_name":"Günther Gries","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543816ded2ac201000062a4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1585820,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jana Karen","original_name":"Jana Karen","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654381bded2ac200aeb07c4c","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705476,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Frederike Tabea May","original_name":"Frederike Tabea May","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654381cae1ad79014bd20b7e","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1141316","wikidata_id":"Q21145459","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
