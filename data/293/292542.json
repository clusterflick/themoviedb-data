How is she so qualified? Because she’s has never been depressed herself. Really! She even says that any autobiographical reference she makes to having been depressed is totally fictional. After all, what Chinese American family isn’t perfect? Certainly not the Wongs! Irreverent, clever, and insanely meta-theatrical, Wong’s attempts at playing savior unravel faster than the nest of yarn she’s perched on. She descends quickly into the divide between Asian porn stars and the impossibly perfect. Along the way she becomes a hysterical living commentary on the cultural and societal pressures that may be creating depression in the first place.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":210560,"logo_path":null,"name":"L-Wing Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wong Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2009904,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kristina Wong","original_name":"Kristina Wong","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":"/tf9QWWCCdPhHBliJMhwhYSKqlbj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66b72a74b0f75eab16c60e31","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Closson","original_name":"Mike Closson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b729bbe61d3d6cee036e66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877331,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kristina Wong","original_name":"Kristina Wong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b72a4c9b1e34fbd95962cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1587387","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
