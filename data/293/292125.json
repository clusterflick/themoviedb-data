Luckily football (soccer) practice is starting up, and Chris meets a few kids on the team-including his cute neighbor Mara. When Mara invites Chris to help liberate some mistreated animals from the local fair, Chris accepts. They head to the fair that night, but get busted by ringleader Malick, who chases them off the grounds. It isn't until the next morning that Chris realizes Momo, a lovable little monkey, stowed away in his backpack. Not wanting to send Momo back to Malick's greedy clutches, Chris must find a way to keep him out of sight. But handling a monkey does have its perks: Mara is spending a lot of time with Chris, and Momo is even lending Chris a paw on the football field. Chris' summer is bound to have a lot of monkey business, but is it enough to drive him bananas?","popularity":0.5709,"poster_path":"/thoMLAPlchXkzb7KpIbVIGHjZvz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monkey in the Middle","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob Horsley","original_name":"Jacob Horsley","popularity":0.1213,"profile_path":"/dRmflIMlxknytPAkLw0xIrPOflr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Chris Gallagher","credit_id":"541270950e0a26730d0008da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daphne Zuniga","original_name":"Daphne Zuniga","popularity":0.9611,"profile_path":"/jzxXGApvXYqYJKFpSH1WUnr8qCa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Olive","credit_id":"541270adc3a3682f6200081b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1363133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soma Bhatia","original_name":"Soma Bhatia","popularity":0.1613,"profile_path":"/rAmHnMbMLv6L7LrA46Gf6fzk5Wg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mara Cruz","credit_id":"541270c6c3a3682f6b000843","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":435044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ry Barrett","original_name":"Ry Barrett","popularity":0.4356,"profile_path":"/eDAKEhyBrFCU7nQOhQD8lySuJL4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Alan Gallagher","credit_id":"541270e00e0a26731f0008d2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326403,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keith Cooper","original_name":"Keith Cooper","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/hDr6hVTRudyNsTalUU8oMDybWVq.jpg","credit_id":"5412706a0e0a267322000894","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182311,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin G.
