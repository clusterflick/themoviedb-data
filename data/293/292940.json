Unsettled is the story of a generation on the front lines of a nation's battle against itself. When the Israeli government announces that it will withdraw from the Gaza Strip, it means lifeguards Lior, 21, and Meir, 27, will be forced to leave their home--Gaza's \"Palm Beach\"--forever. They and their surf posse could be characters on MTV's The Real World, but in the blink of an eye it becomes obvious that the danger is all too real. For Neta, 20, a religious filmmaker, the pullout plan sets off a desperate struggle to convince Israelis and the world that the withdrawal is a crime against God. Soldiers Yuval, 21, and Tamar, 20, must prepare for a mission against other Israelis, putting aside their own emotions to face angry protestors and the prospect of attacks.","popularity":0.0602,"poster_path":"/xMeOCTCjmHR6dInAN1zn9Gkwywq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unsettled","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Hootnick","original_name":"Adam Hootnick","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b7ebc99ba86a0162f949ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0829439","wikidata_id":"Q7897455","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xMeOCTCjmHR6dInAN1zn9Gkwywq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":510}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
