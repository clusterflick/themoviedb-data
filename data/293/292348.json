But after Joe leaves Mary and their inner city life, she finds an unpostmarked envelope under their apartment door with her name written in Joe's handwriting. It contains a letter explaining why he left. It has primarily to do with his feeling that another part of his life was being left behind for his married life, that other life which consists of a want to travel, especially sail the south seas. The actual impetus to leave was inadvertently fostered by Mary through the birthday present she bought for him. So what actually did happen to Joe and will he ever return to his loving wife?","popularity":0.6047,"poster_path":"/60PrhZ4hgoM7T1C85pSk2BIVOLq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That's Why I Left You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Warren","original_name":"James Warren","popularity":0.0758,"profile_path":"/50z7RLCVo9UOZr2F1ERpXCDAj7R.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Joe Thompson (uncredited)","credit_id":"5413e30d0e0a26198a0010b4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline White","original_name":"Jacqueline White","popularity":0.3771,"profile_path":"/sWwxHJr6UEX53bP2seZifT9mUG7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mary Thompson (uncredited)","credit_id":"5413e31fc3a3687dc1001041","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":167922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Nesbitt","original_name":"John Nesbitt","popularity":0.1696,"profile_path":"/yKGHIGmZ1Lr1pYvpDmBPcOqm0nB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"57e8a5a1c3a36835a2017b03","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112005,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Doane R.
