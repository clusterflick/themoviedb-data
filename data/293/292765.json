People welcome the watching eye naturally, they do not feel offended nor do they withdraw, they participate willingly, discreetly. In every place: in bars, on streetcars, along the street. And they never cease to convey messages, even when their voice goes off and they start to stare into space with embarrassment. All the images of \"Gentle Tallinn\" belong to reality as do its sounds. Caught in a relationship of tenderness with every living being and thing, in common fate. With eyes wide open and the sweetness of temporary enchantments.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gentle Tallinn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Cima","original_name":"Alberto Cima","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5415e1f20e0a261c23002883","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
