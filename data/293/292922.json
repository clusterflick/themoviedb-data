Of greater concern to Scotland Yard, however, is that the account of the murder was published nearly two hours prior to the crime having been committed! Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson - the Great Detective and his faithful assistant and chronicler - find themselves challenged with one of their most baffling cases - \"The Case of the Woman Who Was Murdered Tomorrow\"! Will an innocent man be sent to the gallows? How much blood will be shed before a scarred fiend is brought to justice? ...And who are the mysterious Shadow Watchers, a coven of ominous figures who orchestrate terror from within the darkness? Starring Anthony D.P. Mann as Holmes and Terry Wade as Dr. Watson, \"Sherlock Holmes and the Shadow Watchers\" is a horrifying new adventure, produced with the kind permission of the Conan Doyle Estate*.","popularity":0.482,"poster_path":"/zndywVlmDlF3UTKvNA4hfIxLG2s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50153,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Wide Multi Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sherlock Holmes and the Shadow Watchers","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2438553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Wade","original_name":"Terry Wade","popularity":0.1275,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dr. Watson","credit_id":"5daf26dfb5bc210014729589","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1710248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony D.P.
