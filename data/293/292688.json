He loves snakes, to the point that he owns many and even takes a bath with his huge pet python. He meets and falls in love with a beautiful young woman named Malenka, who is the assistant--and mistress--of an older herpetologist professor. Marc discovers that not only is the \"professor\" a fraud but also a dangerous psychotic who had at one time seduced Marc's mother, and Marc believes that the longer Malenka stays with him, the greater danger she's in.","popularity":0.6409,"poster_path":"/dAcegzoHjFJ9PjWeagZXUpuvZwj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Venins","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"In the eye of the snake","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"In The Eye Of The Snake","type":"video title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Cairns","original_name":"Jason Cairns","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Marc Anzer","credit_id":"54159147c3a3684cf3001f13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":158833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Penny","original_name":"Sydney Penny","popularity":0.6548,"profile_path":"/ycGcpBnk0OkBebo8nPN1wb8F05t.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Malika","credit_id":"541591660e0a261c35001e14","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm McDowell","original_name":"Malcolm McDowell","popularity":2.1217,"profile_path":"/hL8ep4Hqj6izX7IlzE7Bbcfq62w.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Prof. Baldwin","credit_id":"5415919f0e0a261c2e001de5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lois Chiles","original_name":"Lois Chiles","popularity":0.9125,"profile_path":"/4iNFyon7E8LvwyyrMVDQ8nItVZk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Claire Anzer","credit_id":"541591e60e0a261c2e001df3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Léotard","original_name":"Philippe Léotard","popularity":0.2082,"profile_path":"/rjvSxdR594HfvlaRKURZDlPE36p.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Phil Anzer","credit_id":"541592010e0a261c27001f14","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1558371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Mongodin","original_name":"Catherine Mongodin","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":"/uJLqEqVg6ec2x6rZYxUXQ7elA8n.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"School teacher","credit_id":"5dd6640b28723c18ad509cc6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Kumbela","original_name":"Joseph Kumbela","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jean-Marie","credit_id":"5dd6642828723c18ad509d33","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":613224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Potok","original_name":"Rebecca Potok","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/4s27Vw8SrVdg1U7x14LYxT7dMFd.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Robert","credit_id":"5dd6644f28723c18ad509d9e","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363908,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Efrem Camerin","original_name":"Efrem Camerin","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"541590e5c3a3684cf7001dac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291211,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacques Sandoz","original_name":"Jacques Sandoz","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5415910ac3a3684cfd001dbe","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19168,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernard Zitzermann","original_name":"Bernard Zitzermann","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/xKBKLqDlOPslacUZX3cjESW6zQa.jpg","credit_id":"60094a91cb80280040fb238c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Reid","original_name":"Max Reid","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60094a6f075288004175dc3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0110126","wikidata_id":"Q3555514","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eEy0idCYkC65tbDX4hPgD7QKQAP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dAcegzoHjFJ9PjWeagZXUpuvZwj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
