Her Violetta Valéry is a vulnerable figure torn between self-indulgence and love, sacrificing personal happiness to become a victim of the social mores of mid-19th-century bourgeois France. Fleming's acting captures the complexity of the character and her vocalism is flawless. She negotiates the wild coloratura of Act One with aplomb, and is stunning in the lyric passages that pervade the opera, and touching in her scenes with her lover, Alfredo, and his father. Her singing is free of the mannerisms that have sometimes crept into her work and at the same time she brings countless personal touches to the role, phrasing and verbal emphases that shed fresh light on the character.","popularity":0.4643,"poster_path":"/uiQT5Fs3XJxM9ASemMxB9EfkTYI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Traviata","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":269139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Fleming","original_name":"Renée Fleming","popularity":0.3384,"profile_path":"/7L6CEpZS2eYmKZquDTFTSpEbTiz.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Violetta Valéry","credit_id":"5413cd5ec3a3687dc8000d40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolando Villazón","original_name":"Rolando Villazón","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/x3uFOePgzuazAmt7AERncBLw9zN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alfredo Germont","credit_id":"5413cd890e0a2619a4000db3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1202498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renato Bruson","original_name":"Renato Bruson","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":"/jghojBUxT4NGj91i0a5D1Ie1sFH.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Giorgio Germont","credit_id":"5dc1b58595c0af0012706572","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1363415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanna Guzmán","original_name":"Suzanna Guzmán","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Flora Bervoix","credit_id":"5413cd6c0e0a26198a000dea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Alkhimova","original_name":"Anna Alkhimova","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Annina","credit_id":"5413cd78c3a3687dbe000d4c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Conlon","original_name":"James Conlon","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":"/mQYnpol3yV53snbqy7ZMVn8qfcW.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5dc1b5e0ef48890011186119","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4081301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Geiger","original_name":"Michael Geiger","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Chorus - Basses","credit_id":"67c1c3c79adcd2562535c2cf","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"5693d7289251415c1e0001bf","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148077,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandre Dumas fils","original_name":"Alexandre Dumas fils","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/ipR2EbPl6cuPmCONW8MA8zsTbhC.jpg","credit_id":"5697e095c3a368760b0003f5","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Maria Piave","original_name":"Francesco Maria Piave","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5697e0a6c3a3687605000356","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Domingo","original_name":"Marta Domingo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc1b60b470ead00138ad009","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Large","original_name":"Brian Large","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/fwMu0qHur53enoBapRcjpKw7Ydq.jpg","credit_id":"67c1c4189adcd2562535c2ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1181343","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x2CMjqQnwqSB2uzhMTfHccuEZeB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uiQT5Fs3XJxM9ASemMxB9EfkTYI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":193687,"name":"verdi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
