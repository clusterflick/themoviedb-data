In 1994 Dominique Aury, a mild-mannered, dowdy editor for France’s prestigious Gallimard press, revealed her authorship. Pola Rapaport explores Aury's inspiration, recreating the world of '50s literary Paris and setting it against dramatic sequences that bring the infamous book to life. The author as well as various French intellectuals expound on the thorny relationship between sexuality and power, submission and freedom, liberation and non-being.","popularity":0.5545,"poster_path":"/jKGbL4Sz2QEP52GlzLbWTz7NoXa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Writer of O","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Mouchet","original_name":"Catherine Mouchet","popularity":0.1814,"profile_path":"/cewBjPNq1tmHuPuHiLVyOvWcOD9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Young Dominique Aury","credit_id":"57bad4bbc3a36815bb003e40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1669142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pénélope Puymirat","original_name":"Pénélope Puymirat","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"O","credit_id":"57bad4c2925141742a001af0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1669143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyril Corral","original_name":"Cyril Corral","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"René","credit_id":"57bad4d2c3a3687e860008d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Rimoux","original_name":"Alain Rimoux","popularity":0.1047,"profile_path":"/t3ErgWuae1kzG6WIK9K6zigtVdi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jean Paulhan","credit_id":"57bad4e5c3a3687e780007ca","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1641027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pola Rapaport","original_name":"Pola Rapaport","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/g7PRDm1mq6aZQDYCFeaCHJkv1V0.jpg","credit_id":"57bad53292514109e000075c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1641027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pola Rapaport","original_name":"Pola Rapaport","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/g7PRDm1mq6aZQDYCFeaCHJkv1V0.jpg","credit_id":"57bad2cdc3a3687ec700066e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0424584","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jKGbL4Sz2QEP52GlzLbWTz7NoXa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/28X5GMNZAaCtHWOttqUpeyPrbgw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":6373,"name":"sadomasochism"},{"id":8802,"name":"pseudonym"},{"id":158713,"name":"bdsm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"arte","release_date":"2010-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
