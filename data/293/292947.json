From 1980 to 1990 they were billed as Exude.  They had a college playlist hit with \"Boys Just Want to Have Sex\" and got two videos on MTV. In 1990 they changed their name to NC-17 and revamped their style into a grungier more Floyd-influenced sound.  Filmmaker Dov Kelemer made a documentary of their career struggles. Once the movie was completed--it played on cable, at film festivals, and a few theaters.  It's available from the www.anybodylisten.com site.  NC-17 has since become inactive, as the members have scattered over several different states. Lead vocalist Frank Rogala remains active on the OC music scene.","popularity":0.142,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Won't Anybody Listen","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542646,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Rogala","original_name":"Frank Rogala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"himself","credit_id":"565bc0ef92514169280051bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542647,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vince Rogala","original_name":"Vince Rogala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"565bc0fe925141692b0054be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Canada","original_name":"Robin Canada","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"565bc10d92514169250055c0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Rogala","original_name":"Nancy Rogala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"herself","credit_id":"565bc11c92514169280051d6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Turman","original_name":"Katherine Turman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"herself","credit_id":"565bc12c925141691b00563f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Washburn","original_name":"Jim Washburn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5681929ec3a36860e9010f66","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":174848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penelope Sudrow","original_name":"Penelope Sudrow","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/7mHWBORLkj9cpdhyIdk3tikb0uQ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"herself","credit_id":"64a17be3d5191f01393e917d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1245608,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeff Jampol","original_name":"Jeff Jampol","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"himself","credit_id":"64a17c0bd5191f00ff8c3f9c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Diamond","original_name":"Rob Diamond","popularity":0.2182,"profile_path":"/gmmsV4lZeJtk9yDnR9AQpax1bB1.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"himself","credit_id":"64a17c1b4a52f80126952ede","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dov Kelemer","original_name":"Dov Kelemer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565bc185c3a3685069005756","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542646,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Rogala","original_name":"Frank Rogala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"568192189251414ecb002dd5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554948,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lyn Jensen","original_name":"Lyn Jensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56819200c3a3684be9010d4f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":978596,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dominic Pereira","original_name":"Dominic Pereira","popularity":0.131,"profile_path":"/wBNVTAY2G42BX6YIGGodJlMCpul.jpg","credit_id":"56819147c3a368227b0075b7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542647,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vince Rogala","original_name":"Vince Rogala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56819230c3a3684be3011c7e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0281376","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
