If this man hadn't suffered his debilitating knee injury, well sir, there'd be statues of him in the Football Hall of Fame. Twenty years later, the shine is wearing off Wetonkawa's golden boy. His only son won't speak to him, his wife wants a divorce so she can marry his brother, and his state rushing record, the one thing he always had, is about to be broken. But thanks to an overzealous preacher, an attempted assassination by the town dog catcher, and a little divine intervention, the Wetonkawa Flash is about to become a legend once again.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/uzc1nMsAu3vYaIgGpnCnqGcw35i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wetonkawa Flash","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0184007","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uzc1nMsAu3vYaIgGpnCnqGcw35i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Wetonkawa Flash (1996) trailer","key":"lDp4k642qHA","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-07-04T22:58:43.000Z","id":"64a4a54c8c44b900cab20972"}]}}}
