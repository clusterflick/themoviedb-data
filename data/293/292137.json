To this end he is to sign a contract with a cabinet minister for whom the villagers are rehearsing a play. It is the very day of the coming of the minister that Ange chooses to pass away, which infuriates his cantankerous wife Lellè. The contract must be signed anyway but how to go about it, mainly with such a family as Ange's: Rinatu, the nationalist, traditionalist son; Sauveur, the former local policeman turned politician; Marcia, Rinatu's daughter, determined to perform the play at any cost; Ange's two wives, the official one: the bad-tempered Lellè, and the unofficial one, the Indian domestic worker of Indian origin? To say nothing of Pantaleone, the deputy mayor, whose wife has been one of Ange's (numerous) mistresses.","popularity":0.1881,"poster_path":"/jYImROSyoawQCpWuafcnDl560Ax.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15316,"logo_path":"/8vhiICXCGJcoGJwn590vhCn3r9E.png","name":"Agora
