Starting with music from Chris Isaak's hit single Wicked Game, she adds her own sung and screamed versions of the lyrics, accompanied by effects-manipulated, diaristic video images. The result is an art-world \"cover\" of a popular artifact, with a woman's voice reinterpreting the male original, and a vivid illustration of the consumer's claim to own and interpret media images.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm a Victim of This Song","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pipilotti Rist","original_name":"Pipilotti Rist","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/4HWQlRBBel6h3fURlYTaFIIrysP.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"541463f30e0a26198a001f16","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pipilotti Rist","original_name":"Pipilotti Rist","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/4HWQlRBBel6h3fURlYTaFIIrysP.jpg","credit_id":"5414640e0e0a26199b001e1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2316727","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
