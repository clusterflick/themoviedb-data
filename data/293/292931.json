For thirty years, Jerry Garcia played guitar and sang for the Grateful Dead, and by doing so, inspired a modern cultural phenomenon: the legions of nomadic fans that made a communal way of life out of following Jerry and the Dead, the Deadheads. The End of the Road began shooting three months prior to Garcia's death in 1995, on the road with the wandering family of Deadheads- on what would be the final tour with Jerry and the Grateful Dead. Featuring a soundtrack by Merl Saunders and Jerry Garcia, the film celebrates this social, political and cultural movement in its twilight.","popularity":0.5489,"poster_path":"/aHaYARswPPVZho8oBsjOupibn4F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78578,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monterey Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of the Road","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Grateful Dead: The End of the Road - The Final Tour '95","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Weir","original_name":"Bob Weir","popularity":0.1945,"profile_path":"/4yYZUCBEeptckOHLusV1TEPJDy3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63eef49dcddbbc00b2ad2564","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Lesh","original_name":"Phil Lesh","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/anwnpAKtVpSm0azesfxouyM6N4N.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63eef4bf45765d0083a45a02","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Hart","original_name":"Mickey Hart","popularity":0.0779,"profile_path":"/yNJVepbyCmZWETB1T9Wy9EXxOEj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63eef4d635818f007953b662","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Kreutzmann","original_name":"Bill Kreutzmann","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/zqyqFwa7mU1vASGYNnIAhippzTJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63eef4e75cc11d008611dc6f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wavy Gravy","original_name":"Wavy Gravy","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63eef4fc35818f009d54118d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3924573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merl Saunders","original_name":"Merl Saunders","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63eef51345765d00b9a3af62","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2093424,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Babatunde Olatunji","original_name":"Babatunde Olatunji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63eef554ea84c7008e51fefb","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3924570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brent Meeske","original_name":"Brent Meeske","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63eef45945765d007f5d7421","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0257606","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2074,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aHaYARswPPVZho8oBsjOupibn4F.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1383},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2074,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iKCvBm17r24UXDGbWe3m8dwmGyR.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1383}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":313377,"name":"jerry garcia"},{"id":313378,"name":"deadheads"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
