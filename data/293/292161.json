Thanks to the views from the helmet-cam, you can feel like you were really there. You’ll be able to say „I was there” and no one can accuse you otherwise. In the film you’ll see places no one has seen before (well, almost no one). You’ll also see places no one will see again because they don’t exist any more. Everything to make you feel the real atmosphere of these places.","popularity":0.092,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alone in the Zone 2: Back to Chernobyl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arkadiusz Podniesiński","original_name":"Arkadiusz Podniesiński","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5412d938c3a3682f5e0010cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
