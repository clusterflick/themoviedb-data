In the early years, Mitra is repeatedly punished as the warden tries to break her. This includes punishment for delivering a baby in the prison cell while all of the prison staff has taken shelter during an Iraqi bombing. The warden's attitude starts to change after 8 years, when Mitra tries to protect a new inmate from rape at the hands of her older cellmates. When the baby comes back in 1991 as a 17 year old delinquent, Sepideh, the warden respects Mitra enough to protect the girl.","popularity":0.3702,"poster_path":"/fTWpsDZchjFeWUt1IMR9UJBa41i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Omid Film","origin_country":"IR"},{"id":32955,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bamdad Film","origin_country":"IR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2002-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women's Prison","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","title":"Zendan-e zanan","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Zendane Zanan","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1074044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roya Nownahali","original_name":"Roya Nownahali","popularity":0.1377,"profile_path":"/1urQlwbprY3kBVKL9acEcPOYcNc.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Mitra","credit_id":"54149e57c3a3687dc50025e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roya Taymourian","original_name":"Roya Taymourian","popularity":0.1086,"profile_path":"/rFocpMu12GoIX7vWEQ27niGQefc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Warden","credit_id":"54149e65c3a3687db90024c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pegah Ahangarani","original_name":"Pegah Ahangarani","popularity":0.1929,"profile_path":"/46laelZ4avAuYsl0WpH4uWWa6T1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sepideh","credit_id":"54149e79c3a3687dc10024aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1345985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Golab Adine","original_name":"Golab Adine","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/jwQuPumKtx9oeAmicVkLtO7KqWy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"56f272d8c3a368077300120f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1177805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryam Boubani","original_name":"Maryam Boubani","popularity":0.1218,"profile_path":"/gTXOvOoEf9SUIEBIijd0EMTiKwJ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"56f272e6925141553f00101e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manijeh Hekmat","original_name":"Manijeh Hekmat","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5414a0fbc3a3687dc10024e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3692123,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Amir Abedi","original_name":"Amir Abedi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/fZuH2n7zuc7SIdl2OXUtB0FXWqW.jpg","credit_id":"6318e3a16f43ec008054abbd","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345980,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Farid Mostafavi","original_name":"Farid Mostafavi","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f2729dc3a3680773001204","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0332834","wikidata_id":"Q5954764","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fTWpsDZchjFeWUt1IMR9UJBa41i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
