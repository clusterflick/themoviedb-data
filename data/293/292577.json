What does it mean to survivors of acid violence? What does it mean to people in their environment? How do the two world-views interact? What do concepts of 'fear', 'power', 'innocence' and 'beauty' mean to us? The Newborns attempts to provide a lens to the survivors of acid violence, to look forward and gaze back. They take us through the ennui of their domestic and public spaces in a nameless dystopian city, its factories, houses and motels, and its promises, never honored.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/8UXRrHOBsb3TjHMvbBj0bqP0YJu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2014-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Newborns","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laxmi Agarwal","original_name":"Laxmi Agarwal","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5414b7b30e0a261992002747","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1363691,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Megha Ramaswamy","original_name":"Megha Ramaswamy","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":"/eXZpoiMmNpFolnErlfQ91yww4wW.jpg","credit_id":"5414b78cc3a3687dc1002716","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1363691,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Megha Ramaswamy","original_name":"Megha Ramaswamy","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":"/eXZpoiMmNpFolnErlfQ91yww4wW.jpg","credit_id":"5414b7eec3a3687db900273e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3743010","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8UXRrHOBsb3TjHMvbBj0bqP0YJu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
