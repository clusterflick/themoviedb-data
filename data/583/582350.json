Akeem hopes to rise in the track and field world will take him to the U.S. to reunite him with his mother who has supported the family while living as an illegal resident for over a decade. But Akeem's rising star is weighed down by turmoil at home: a volatile father, and an unruly older brother who insinuates himself into Akeem's career as a means of escaping - or perhaps enhancing - his scam artist hustle. Not only does Akeem have to prove to himself and everyone that he can succeed, but also overcome the struggles that may ultimately bring him down.","popularity":1.0051,"poster_path":"/wnZ5hoWuw3reRXSIBvo0bM3Tbre.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JM","name":"Jamaica"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-24","revenue":54000,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We all have our own races to run","title":"Sprinter","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorraine Toussaint","original_name":"Lorraine Toussaint","popularity":0.8291,"profile_path":"/ali9XSMkZ0uAQLkmK0PoHXhJS0t.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Donna","credit_id":"5dccdf0e79a1c30017461e0b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Alan Grier","original_name":"David Alan Grier","popularity":0.8517,"profile_path":"/jzo5B1zoIB8NOV68wLp9g1R8d5o.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Coach","credit_id":"5dccdf22e263bb001772370b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryshere Y.
