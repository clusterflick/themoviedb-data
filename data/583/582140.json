The story follows Lucky on the day of his release from his latest sentence. As he wanders around Liverpool, not really belonging anywhere, it becomes clear that he is still waiting for his father, a man who has long since abandoned Lucky and his family, to return and take him back 'home' to Africa.” - Richard Parkin","popularity":1.3412,"poster_path":"/feV7l9VBQeejK4myxXeqXvI1bfE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Barber","original_name":"Paul Barber","popularity":0.1466,"profile_path":"/9MkXuS9egXer8htsSLLXLXYgTdc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sam ‘Lucky’ Ubootu","credit_id":"5c6547080e0a26562797cff7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Treves","original_name":"Frederick Treves","popularity":0.1676,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Prison governor","credit_id":"5c65471f0e0a26562797d00e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Sheard","original_name":"Michael Sheard","popularity":0.3582,"profile_path":"/3Ixa3kEGEVCNumIMcLjq5VmU65y.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Prison officer","credit_id":"5c6547389251412fb4001865","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1249603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Moorey","original_name":"Frank Moorey","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mr. Oliphant","credit_id":"5c6547590e0a2625d197f263","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2242232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doreen Sloane","original_name":"Doreen Sloane","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Shop assistant","credit_id":"5c654793c3a36843c6d7e677","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1394809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Erasmus","original_name":"Alan Erasmus","popularity":0.0931,"profile_path":"/u9Sn4O778C3gQkGtUQnkHKyVeGc.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Errol","credit_id":"5c6547a80e0a267dfd9ba9f8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":975564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Manahan","original_name":"Anna Manahan","popularity":0.1732,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"5c6547d30e0a267b909728bb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Kerrigan","original_name":"Peter Kerrigan","popularity":0.2244,"profile_path":"/8C3KAA8tmTiiCQHTZ6A0ptCDYNC.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Det.
