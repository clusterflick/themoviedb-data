Operating out of Bangkok, Thailand, the Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV founding member started this audio and visual endeavour after Coil's conclusion. Despite the name, it was a solo project relying heavily on computer generated vocals. The name was derived from a play on words, combining the terms houseboy, house of boys, boys' choir, and Threshold House, which was Coil's own label. \"Form Grows Rampant\" is the soundtrack of a film shot by Christopherson (a video capture at the GinJae Vegetarian Festival in the south of Thailand) and his first major musical project since the tragic death of John Balance and Coil's subsequent demise.","popularity":0.1932,"poster_path":"/htrpdaaTy1OUE2XcutpuA9ImCbQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2007-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Threshold HouseBoys Choir: Form Grows Rampant","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4282357,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ryota Matsumoto","original_name":"Ryota Matsumoto","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/nCienKURDHQU5iya0es0icv5ZvO.jpg","credit_id":"650b9b6c2c6b7b013949e513","department":"Crew","job":"Post Production Consulting"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Christopherson","original_name":"Peter Christopherson","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/b7TjpWqYzIyu0eCpKTW3fTJZo6X.jpg","credit_id":"5c661bf8c3a3684fabdcac01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Christopherson","original_name":"Peter Christopherson","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/b7TjpWqYzIyu0eCpKTW3fTJZo6X.jpg","credit_id":"5d838338e04aca0225c490f6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Christopherson","original_name":"Peter Christopherson","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/b7TjpWqYzIyu0eCpKTW3fTJZo6X.jpg","credit_id":"67baf2a5a23929ac28becef0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.65,"height":545,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gkhIpzeURjPWuadd1IX56eibhqj.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":899}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/htrpdaaTy1OUE2XcutpuA9ImCbQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4720,"name":"ritual"},{"id":10414,"name":"trance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2007-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
