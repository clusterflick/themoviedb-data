The main difference is that Raban’s work was made when cinematic media had distinct physical properties linking medium directly to image - this self portrait recognizes that there is no such simple materiality for cinema following the emergence of digital processes. Instead the work takes a conceptual base – the speed of light and the time taken for light to travel from the sun to illuminate objects on earth –thus the duration of 8 minutes 20 seconds.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/w3iEQn2eirlEQQkoC9dRnqdvMIG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self Portrait After Raban Take Measure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malcolm Le Grice","original_name":"Malcolm Le Grice","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/dXry25TyoLUpViu8Paqf6RMkDv7.jpg","credit_id":"5c69c3450e0a262fa1a11803","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w3iEQn2eirlEQQkoC9dRnqdvMIG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1521,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m5Ou4SA0FF2zqe5cCffGf9TEuDj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
