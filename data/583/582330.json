Played by choreographer/dancer François Chaignaud, a sprightly group of Muses emerges dancing from a painting on the wall. At an exhibition at the Swiss Institute in 2016 Dellsperger reproduced the wall painting and in a strange switch the creation of the set precedes the idea of the film, even becoming its trigger.

The loop is closed.","popularity":0.1366,"poster_path":"/mDq9KVscxmwOzFYTCoJImISYHzo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Body Double 35","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Chaignaud","original_name":"François Chaignaud","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c6675740e0a2625d199f48e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brice Dellsperger","original_name":"Brice Dellsperger","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6676489251412fc6020019","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242787,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Marc Camille Chaimowicz","original_name":"Marc Camille Chaimowicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6675e70e0a2625d199f506","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242789,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivan Gariel","original_name":"Ivan Gariel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6676610e0a2625d199f5a1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242793,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Sukki Ho","original_name":"Sukki Ho","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6676dfc3a3684f97dcfadd","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Dresser"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quentin Goujout","original_name":"Quentin Goujout","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c66772f0e0a267dfd9da09a","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":386216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Floyd Simmons","original_name":"Floyd Simmons","popularity":0.1434,"profile_path":"/piZikWf8zKOZmYJjLEWLqQ5JBW9.jpg","credit_id":"5c6676080e0a266dac9d43d2","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvain Decloitre","original_name":"Sylvain Decloitre","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c66771cc3a3684f97dcfaf6","department":"Directing","job":"Second Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brice Dellsperger","original_name":"Brice Dellsperger","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c66758c925141250a019315","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Didier Blasco","original_name":"Didier Blasco","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c66761592514177bdfe4172","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242775,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Loïc Bovon","original_name":"Loïc Bovon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c667639c3a3684f97dcfa22","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242794,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Selim Bibi Moreau","original_name":"Selim Bibi Moreau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c66770ac3a368349fd8f8d4","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Didier Blasco","original_name":"Didier Blasco","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6676260e0a267dfd9d9f9e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quentin Goujout","original_name":"Quentin Goujout","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6677370e0a26562799d175","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242797,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeff Lynne","original_name":"Jeff Lynne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c66775ec3a36847bbd9df19","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.623,"height":854,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mDq9KVscxmwOzFYTCoJImISYHzo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
