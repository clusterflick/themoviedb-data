His aim was to break the British rubber monopoly and produce this material in Brazil for his car production in the United States. Today, the remains of construction testify to the scale of the failure of this neocolonialist endeavor that lasted less than a decade.  Nowadays, Fordlandia is a space suspended between times, between the 20th and 21st centuries, between utopia and dystopia, between visibility and invisibility: architectural buildings of steel, glass, and masonry still remain in use while traces of indigenous life left no marks on the ground.","popularity":0.3041,"poster_path":"/xUcFxboTlNZXb0S0gLkaOGXW29b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kintop","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2019-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fordlandia Malaise is a film about the memory and the present of Fordlandia, the company town founded by Henry Ford in the Amazon rain forest in 1928.","title":"Fordlandia Malaise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Fordlândia Malaise","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1344584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susana de Sousa Dias","original_name":"Susana de Sousa Dias","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6580b0c3a3684cecd876d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866809,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"António de Sousa Dias","original_name":"António de Sousa Dias","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6580ccc3a3684fabdb9d96","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1873570,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ansgar Schäefer","original_name":"Ansgar Schäefer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6580e40e0a265111985ba3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242364,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rui Ribeiro","original_name":"Rui Ribeiro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6592e39251412fc60098b6","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1344584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susana de Sousa Dias","original_name":"Susana de Sousa Dias","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c65b39c0e0a266dac9c0bb0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1344584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susana de Sousa Dias","original_name":"Susana de Sousa Dias","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c65b391925141250a0074ee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9834024","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":776,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4pxDBpRRQ1DWFRvL2y3mCJB2Ucb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1380},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":776,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zdVN5ZmeltVOrvLej4VpcQiQHSW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1380},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":776,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sLW7H0wacnQL41Ve3rktRb5cnqg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1380},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":776,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fQCI6f8y4n5Hy5deK3Uo2b92jQg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1380}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2999,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xUcFxboTlNZXb0S0gLkaOGXW29b.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1999},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1670,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6iHGOWInDlhOuEMSS59u2RuM4Aj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1181}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":592,"name":"capitalism"},{"id":10937,"name":"memory"},{"id":194369,"name":"post-colonial"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlinale","release_date":"2019-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
