One of a missing young man with Asperger's Syndrome who seeks refuge in the underground labyrinth of NYC. The other follows a gambling Ecuadorian livery driver & a Chinese woman desperate to get home to her sick child. Along each of their journeys through the urban landscape, they discover the deeper understanding of communication & their intimate connections despite their barriers. H.O.M.E. is an understated yet lyrical exploration of urban alienation & meaningful encounters through the lens of a \"disconnected\" city in constant motion.","popularity":1.0059,"poster_path":"/oK1QIZtQuhWB7IEivFX5HGiA7kX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115220,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gashouse Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A \"love letter\" to New York City through its subways & enclaves","title":"H.O.M.E.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesús Ochoa","original_name":"Jesús Ochoa","popularity":0.3099,"profile_path":"/7q5cin3hrPIhMqRkPZ2sSyTrqlk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gabriel","credit_id":"5c65bc0ac3a36843c6d8bf07","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Ray Valdez","original_name":"Jeremy Ray Valdez","popularity":0.2153,"profile_path":"/rzVquZ3QWjbgeNrlkJIeyNsAi1m.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Danny","credit_id":"5c65bc1b0e0a26562798a6df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1379383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Lin","original_name":"Angela Lin","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":"/lx5DzMJa34jUlXXh1E4qKkut5yJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sze Wun","credit_id":"5c65bc2fc3a36847bbd8b671","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Alban","original_name":"Carlo Alban","popularity":0.4705,"profile_path":"/48fWtfdHt40ew6g1ITj54po6ZjE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Manny (voice)","credit_id":"5c65bc52c3a3681b7cdc8860","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Augarten","original_name":"Lauren Augarten","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/3klGeOn9WUX4ITok0i1HGj6XXqv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Carley","credit_id":"5c65bc7b9251412fc600e374","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Thompson","original_name":"Al Thompson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"MTA Employee","credit_id":"5c65bc8d0e0a26562798a779","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Lynn Gorney","original_name":"Karen Lynn Gorney","popularity":0.5358,"profile_path":"/wLd924doDT7Xo4RGi23i0kjby47.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Waitress","credit_id":"5c65bcc29251412fb400e3e5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lino Del Core","original_name":"Lino Del Core","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Hasidic Man","credit_id":"5c65bdb89251412fbf00b4a7","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Darren Dean","original_name":"Darren Dean","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c65bd3d0e0a266dac9c1d99","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358466,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Daniel Maldonado","original_name":"Daniel Maldonado","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c65bd2292514177bdfd2a03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2397902","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":1260,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oK1QIZtQuhWB7IEivFX5HGiA7kX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":860}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":1749,"name":"taxi driver"},{"id":159451,"name":"subway station"},{"id":181318,"name":"asperger's syndrome"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
