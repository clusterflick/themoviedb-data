Through a robotâ€™s agnostic eye, the film looks at how human dramas are inscribed onto the inanimate, searching for possible parallels between automation and purgatory, depression and malfunction.  The film is inspired by a real event that occurred in Washington, D.C. on 17 July 2017, where an automated security robot from the company Knightscope was found floating in a fountain at the building it patrolled. It had plunged into the water while on a routine patrol, spurring speculation about whether the machine had chosen to end its life or if this was just a glitch in an otherwise reliable new technology. Perhaps more interesting than the fate of the machine was the desire to see its death within a human context.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/lO00cZzr7oiewGsFgz1sNUHOpSS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meridian","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Calum Walter","original_name":"Calum Walter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c649ffb0e0a26562796efa7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Calum Walter","original_name":"Calum Walter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df04a844b0c6300154a7173","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lO00cZzr7oiewGsFgz1sNUHOpSS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sundance Film Festival","release_date":"2020-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
