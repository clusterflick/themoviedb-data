Hutton organized her first all-women big band, Ina Ray Hutton and her Melodears, in 1935. A few film appearances for the band and a starring role for Hutton in Ever Since Venus (1944), along with endless national touring, eventually led her to NBC and a musical variety show in 1956. In this Paramount short, one of a series directed by Fred Waller who went on to invent Cinerama, Hutton—grooving up front in her standard sheer evening dress—and the original Melodears, perform “Organ Grinder’s Swing Overture” followed by The Winstead Trio doing “The Bugle Call Rag.”","popularity":0.0818,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swing Hutton Swing","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1281513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ina Ray Hutton","original_name":"Ina Ray Hutton","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/ooQyp6bx2DjpCz7lE39NS7fSKZ5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c673474c3a3684f97de3a57","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1146991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Waller","original_name":"Fred Waller","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/jdtGlSK7jlO5cy6qVkEcq7emaRn.jpg","credit_id":"5c6734a7c3a368745edeaa1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2243103,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"William Steiner Jr.","original_name":"William Steiner Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6734bc0e0a267dfd9ec745","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0029630","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1937-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
