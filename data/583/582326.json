Played by androgynous model Alex Wetter, a happy gang of girls are whooping it up under the showers in a high school locker room where the rows of lockers seem to double up and form a space-time loop. The loop comes to an end as, one by one, they disappear into the steam and turn into infinite variations on one of their number : Carrie. Still under the shower, Carrie herself seems unaware of what is going on around her. With a touch of sensuality the camera suggests that the child is becoming a woman. Terror-stricken, Carrie sees that her hands are covered with blood.","popularity":0.062,"poster_path":"/pOjifbtRfC4EW4DjNPQNVGgZnhr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":227521,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beau Bizarre","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Show her","title":"Body Double 32","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Wetter","original_name":"Alexandre Wetter","popularity":0.1007,"profile_path":"/bO32jzfEVNRtew0mbhJx2u2zCHo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Carrie & the girls","credit_id":"5c66718b9251412fc401be0e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2242769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Perge","original_name":"Nicolas Perge","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662ffb91713ea60122695e1e","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brice Dellsperger","original_name":"Brice Dellsperger","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6671b49251412fb40206f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Didier Blasco","original_name":"Didier Blasco","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6671dec3a3684fabdd1cba","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242775,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Loïc Bovon","original_name":"Loïc Bovon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6671fcc3a36843c6d9f47e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brice Dellsperger","original_name":"Brice Dellsperger","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6672470e0a267dfd9d9bdf","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quentin Goujout","original_name":"Quentin Goujout","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c66726ec3a3684fabdd1d2f","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brice Dellsperger","original_name":"Brice Dellsperger","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c66721a0e0a2651119a0794","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7738628","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.591,"height":1002,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pOjifbtRfC4EW4DjNPQNVGgZnhr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":592}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
