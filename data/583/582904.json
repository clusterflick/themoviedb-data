He walks head down, sad, in suit, hat, and wire-rim glasses. In this nearly wordless animation, bad things happen to him. First an elevator malfunction leads to a trip to the hospital: he leaves with his arm in a sling. Another accident at work results in another hospital visit. The same indifferent stretcher bearers and the same indifferent nurse see to his care. Now, his leg is in a cast as well as his arm. He soldiers on, using a cane. When a traffic sign malfunctions, it's back to the hospital; he leaves with bandaged head, piloting a wheelchair. But his woes aren't over yet. After one more mishap, Philip Jenkins finally has something to say.","popularity":0.1963,"poster_path":"/P7YxZx28LxENVZWoj4OrguuzDx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30241,"logo_path":null,"name":"AtomFilms","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Bad Day for Philip Jenkins","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224841,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mo Willems","original_name":"Mo Willems","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/f6Nbn3S09ecJ5SYJSnUXvVkP9xR.jpg","credit_id":"5c6a14c0c3a36843c6e2b2cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224841,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mo Willems","original_name":"Mo Willems","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/f6Nbn3S09ecJ5SYJSnUXvVkP9xR.jpg","credit_id":"5c6a14eb925141250a08ee8d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224841,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mo Willems","original_name":"Mo Willems","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/f6Nbn3S09ecJ5SYJSnUXvVkP9xR.jpg","credit_id":"5c6a14cb0e0a261e06996bf9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0344844","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/P7YxZx28LxENVZWoj4OrguuzDx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
