Similar to his namesake -Moses 2,000 years earlier- our hero, Moises suffers from a speech impediment and anger issues. The similarities don't stop there - in the town, there seems to be BLOOD flowing in the Mississippi River. Other plagues follow, including frogs and locusts that aim to devour the town's historic landmarks.","popularity":0.1953,"poster_path":"/oB42Ys2ymkQDed0pxzeF62Ue0WX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140667,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ark Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A talented young filmmaker desperate to escape his small town discovers his destiny is to save it.","title":"The Law of Moises","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2249663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nic Caruccio","original_name":"Nic Caruccio","popularity":0.6033,"profile_path":"/d7hBJxqIHAf3jUM1wjLmnCTlI8A.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6579ee084d23dd00c6aacc75","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3908305,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Stephanie MacDonald","original_name":"Stephanie MacDonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e0ea2623d27800852d6c68","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Crystal Barnes","original_name":"Crystal Barnes","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c321a8d1b8e0037baa91c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541441,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ted Reilly","original_name":"Ted Reilly","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c324b40d0fe00361c362f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1528780,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danny Fogarty","original_name":"Danny Fogarty","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c3299a7e36300372c5486","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Crystal Barnes","original_name":"Crystal Barnes","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c3227e267de00321d8165","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286433,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Markie Glassgow","original_name":"Markie Glassgow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c322fc1ffbd0035dfa521","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599877,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Patrick Charles","original_name":"Patrick Charles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c3293a6e2d2003a6b9aa2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966167,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Seneca Lester","original_name":"Seneca Lester","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c3237663b87003936088f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Crystal Barnes","original_name":"Crystal Barnes","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c321e8d1b8e0035b7e316","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2024295,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Devin Delaney","original_name":"Devin Delaney","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c32591fa1c800350e03d6","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790010,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Melissa Ostrander","original_name":"Melissa Ostrander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c3241688cd00036264f9a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790011,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Bryan McLemore Smith","original_name":"Bryan McLemore Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6c32af8d1b8e0036b97b62","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oB42Ys2ymkQDed0pxzeF62Ue0WX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":659}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
