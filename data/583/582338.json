They are very normal \"citizens above all suspicion\", yet they consider themselves special researchers, in their own way pioneers of a new awareness that they are convinced will come from space. \"ALBE\" is the name of the group they created to be able to share experiences, thoughts and moods, with the certainty of not being taken for crazy. Between s√©ances in contact with astral beings, extraterrestrial exorcisms , hunting for Orbs and sky-watching sessions, the group is in constant rehearsals and signals, even with the help of the indispensable mobile phone.In counterpoint, the director Elisa Fuksas conducts a personal research between science and faith on similar themes speaking with religious, astrophysicists,and with Carlo, \"alien-human\", an authentic 'Martian in Rome', trying to answer the question: \"Are we alone in the Universe\"?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ALBE: A Life Beyond Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6889748","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
