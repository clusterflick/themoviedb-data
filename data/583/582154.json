The film shows a woman’s hands busy washing the dishes, which include a white porcelain cup in the shape of a woman’s body. Monika Treut said of the film in 1978 that “something very familiar suddenly comes at us from the screen as something completely unusual”. It was shot with Margaret Raspé’s famous “camera helmet”, which had an Agfa Super 8 Microflex camera attached to it, placing the viewfinder in front of the eye.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8kdnahKcvwKQt3VrvsS3pr1gI6S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1976-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow – Let Them Swing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Raspé","original_name":"Margaret Raspé","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6552f0c3a36843c6d7f7fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9776394","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8kdnahKcvwKQt3VrvsS3pr1gI6S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Theater im Kartoffelkeller, Berlin","release_date":"1976-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
