Upon returning home, they were changed men, and recounted tales of alien abduction.  Today, only two of the three men are alive to tell the story of what unfolded before, during, and after that fateful outing, and they're convinced it was extraterrestrial.  This film explores the haunting accounts of two friends who underwent an alien abduction experience while camping in the remote mountains. Featuring psychedelic visuals and an alien hand print, Ten Eleven O Two opens a plethora of questions and is a must-see for anyone interested in the paranormal.  Based on the true life events of Ken Mathis and Adolph Santistevan.","popularity":0.3229,"poster_path":"/c9TNWyD4ciEORGZLmMaa1k4AxI9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A modern campfire story--of alien abduction.","title":"Ten Eleven O Two","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"10 11 0 2","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3650423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Mathis","original_name":"Ken Mathis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"62ec10adce997a005dae2f49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3650424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolph Santistevan","original_name":"Adolph Santistevan","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"62ec10b46f9746005cf00736","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3650428,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roger Halloway","original_name":"Roger Halloway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ec1128091e6200604950e0","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566261,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mackenzie Mathis","original_name":"Mackenzie Mathis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ec10e26f9746005faa22d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566261,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mackenzie Mathis","original_name":"Mackenzie Mathis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ec10d78566d2005a48b465","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1874424,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nao Nakazawa","original_name":"Nao Nakazawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ec111b2736480060e281b7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3650430,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Timba Harris","original_name":"Timba Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ec1174ea84c7005ecf86ce","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2589656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kadet Kuhne","original_name":"Kadet Kuhne","popularity":0.0694,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ec115f8566d2005a48b480","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741548,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marcia Ong","original_name":"Marcia Ong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ec10f048333a0061eb9c69","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3650426,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Anthony Parisi","original_name":"Paul Anthony Parisi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ec110daf4324005f23182e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3650431,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leanne Kelly","original_name":"Leanne Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ec11a33af9290058f47873","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73598,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frédéric Chopin","original_name":"Fryderyk Chopin","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/bpknVuZcUXcqAEUECWteAXWYjUN.jpg","credit_id":"62ec1187fc5f060059c532a9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5109812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"tenelevenotwo","instagram_id":"TenElevenOTwo","twitter_id":"tenelevenotwo"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g4mI6gDwBbixExQe5Pl8XyMoDKL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c9TNWyD4ciEORGZLmMaa1k4AxI9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11627,"name":"paranormal phenomena"},{"id":4862,"name":"alien life-form"},{"id":9951,"name":"alien"},{"id":9853,"name":"paranormal"},{"id":12553,"name":"alien abduction"},{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"},{"id":161745,"name":"handprint"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"},{"id":229361,"name":"paranormal survivor"},{"id":274497,"name":"polygraph"},{"id":276130,"name":"paranormal events"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TEN ELEVEN O TWO -
