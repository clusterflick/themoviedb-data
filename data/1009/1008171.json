During that time of turmoil Latin American bishops created the famous preferential option for the poor, demanding justice, food and education in the name of the gospel. Using interviews and old footage, the film follows the civil war and the role of the Church in it. In 1977, after the murder of Father Rutilio Grande, the Archbishop Oscar Romero took a strong anti government position, broadcasting sermons over Radio Luz demanding that the government stop the repression. He could not understand why he was thought to be a follower of Karl Marx, when he knew \"he followed only Jesus Christ.\" An inspiring film about people of faith who stood up against injustice.","popularity":0.1301,"poster_path":"/wQHM4sWpNKOUDBH1GQzcQ0irGp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nova-T","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SV","name":"El Salvador"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Be A Patriot, Kill A Priest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3649190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sante Altizio","original_name":"Sante Altizio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62eaf3fbaede590059ec5923","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1413,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wQHM4sWpNKOUDBH1GQzcQ0irGp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7605,"name":"el salvador"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
