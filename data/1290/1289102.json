Letter From X to F","overview":"Based in Paris from 2016 to 2018 as artist-in-residence at Laboratoires dâ€™Aubervilliers, Paloma Polo committed to an investigation into a dimension of the history of political struggles shaping the Parisian north periphery. The Parisian Banlieue Rouge at large sheltered thousands of Spanish political exiles since the civil war and throughout Francoism. Hundreds of them lived a ghostly existence, many with counterfeited identifications and some completely clandestine, as they strived in the shadows for the organisation of a movement in Spain to democratically assail a brutally repressive and violent system.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Preacher and the Manichean.
