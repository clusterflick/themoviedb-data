The film was made to be played at the wrap party for The Prince of Egypt, but went on to play at the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival in 2001. Subsequently the film has become an obscure oddity amongst Godzilla fans.","popularity":0.0984,"poster_path":"/A5xZcvUKJdRXGeE7rt546BqA0GK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228748,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlanteum Visual Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Faith can't destroy him!","title":"Moses vs. Godzilla","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4709617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Lissau","original_name":"Frederick Lissau","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Moses","credit_id":"6640f2e3fb95ec88243216d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4298448,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Armen Melkonian","original_name":"Armen Melkonian","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Rameses","credit_id":"6640f2f28780d746f93217a2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4709606,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Brad Morris","original_name":"Brad Morris","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6640ef83ff5ed5ff3bf0c2e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4709606,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Brad Morris","original_name":"Brad Morris","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6640ef8b7b19528f6059c58d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ishirō Honda","original_name":"本多猪四郎","popularity":0.7026,"profile_path":"/2b0f1J1ineDGWwyzkrUbU1tzJhG.jpg","credit_id":"6640ef9503eae5223af0c24b","department":"Writing","job":"Characters"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4709606,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Brad Morris","original_name":"Brad Morris","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6640f16308cd508acfc10e7d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4709624,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hezekiah McMurray","original_name":"Hezekiah McMurray","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6640f31663cc7a9e5059b03d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557326,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Bruce Spaulding Fuller","original_name":"Bruce Spaulding Fuller","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6640f37a2b51a82484208471","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w80IhdYWuAbTo4FsDf8ySB42Gza.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/13oBlFj180RZDhiDL3Vn9QdZtjs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/A5xZcvUKJdRXGeE7rt546BqA0GK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"NO DANCE Film & Multimedia Festival","release_date":"2001-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"San Francisco Jewish Film Festival (SFJFF) 2001","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Moses vs. Godzilla (Moisés contra Godzilla) paródia parody","key":"wflVN67ZwUQ","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-07-19T20:44:18.000Z","id":"6640eff5edc44438db5553fc"}]}}}
