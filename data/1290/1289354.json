The film has followed Naoto for nearly a decade and portrays how Naoto and the animals survived the residents' return to the town, Tokyo Olympics, and COVID-19.  In the course of 10 years, many animals and humans were born and died. But Naoto remained in the town and took care of the animals. He raised chickens and kept bees in order to survive. In 2017, Tomioka became the place where people can come back to live, however most young people didn’t return.  There is no end in sight for the nuclear crisis in Fukushima. The contaminated water is overflowing and will be pumped out to the ocean soon. Meanwhile the government is trying to restart the nuclear reactors all over the country. The film will give us a chance to reflect on this situation by looking at how Naoto and animals survive in Fukushima.","popularity":0.2573,"poster_path":"/dJbgPnJ3If0zvbrDCmDZdcK8dHF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2023-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alone Again in Fukushima","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4709749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naoto Matsumura","original_name":"Naoto Matsumura","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":"/28dTuENRQ35bBmOMzkK8FuAiarE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66410501d58cbb6e98c111c5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1503266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mayu Nakamura","original_name":"Mayu Nakamura","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/fjn0ac5fzPyB12AmzzggH3oxwTu.jpg","credit_id":"66410518743ea53aa159b425","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1634161,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tetsujirô Yamagami","original_name":"山上徹二郎","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6641057134c7a6f03959b064","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1503266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mayu Nakamura","original_name":"Mayu Nakamura","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/fjn0ac5fzPyB12AmzzggH3oxwTu.jpg","credit_id":"66410582efb80a75d2961dc5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1186891,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tomohiko Tsuji","original_name":"辻智彦","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664105b2c2b8130482ff66f8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2468713,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hideki Seino","original_name":"清野英樹","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664105f1f770cd48b70bcf2d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lnkpGqFBr5Yih0IxPxAD89qXIz5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hfU9eRTMbn1m6lp68PohKco22s2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l998u9501l4NiUmlly4QWwBEiVp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uJy4m5xz96fb9Y9f8a24SrDZUFX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dJbgPnJ3If0zvbrDCmDZdcK8dHF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":215355,"name":"fukushima disaster (2011)"},{"id":226617,"name":"nuclear accident"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"「劇場版 ナオト、いまもひとりっきり」予告編","key":"rtU84KZYNIY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-01-18T03:00:32.000Z","id":"6641067cf1174a8adb0bcd1a"}]}}}
