Yet the story of the Jankovics family is a parabolic tale of Hungarian history over the past 100 years. Although in our film members of the Jankovics family are the ones who suffer by the events, many others have experienced similar humiliations over the past 100 years. These events of life - consciously or unconsciously - had an impact on Marcell Jankovics. Like the thousands of people who carry the traumas of their parents and grandparents in some way, whether they are aware of it or not.","popularity":0.0776,"poster_path":"/qHKJrhq9lltewgWqBSEsPL8x160.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Budapest Film Produkciós","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2021-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jankovicsok","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcell Jankovics","original_name":"Marcell Jankovics","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/7tR351qKLmQdeLFtFFrOKODHRtR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"656fb1120859b400c538b9fb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Szonja Szabó","original_name":"Szonja Szabó","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656fb0fe7a1bd6011b8ce07b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20881040","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":873,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/qHKJrhq9lltewgWqBSEsPL8x160.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":612}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
