Returning an iconic car to its desired specification involves applied knowledge, which only a few revered masters possess. This program unearths the superstars of this domain, and unveils the secrets of their trade, in a culture where precision and skill is everything. From the legends of Japan's early auto industry, to the global car icons of Europe, and the soul of American motoring heritage: these magnificent creations and the craftsmen who made them are the heart of the program. It's a battle of philosophies - some shops only authentically restore these cars, while others pimp them out. Here we find the merging of science, technology, artistry and unique characters, and witness the passion for and enjoyment of these vehicles at race circuits and shows all over Japan. It's a high-octane mix that will intoxicate car fans everywhere","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Retro Car Kings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3685580","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
