When they get there, strange things start happening. The cabin was used as a torture/execution site in medieval times. A young man named Jared, who was convicted of killing his wife, was tortured to death. Only thing was, he was innocent, and his soul is now trapped in that very cabin. His soul can't be released until the cabin is destroyed. Jared placed a spell on Earth, in the year 1998 AD, to make Earth devoid of light and life. One by one, the kids are turned into bloodthirsty, merciless zombie-deadites, as Jared possesses their very bodies, in an attempt to make them destroy the cabin. The helpless kids fight for their very lives against what used to be friends and lovers.","popularity":0.3386,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":215249,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kleinmax
