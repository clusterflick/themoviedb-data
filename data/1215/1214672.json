With an unrelenting passion for uncovering the last true stories hidden within the refuse left in these trash-strewn landscapes, Lew considers himself a \"Dumpster Archaeologist,\" meticulously connecting the dots and hunting down the secrets others have discarded. The alleyways transform into an endless playground of mysteries, inviting us to ponder the profound questions of privacy, excess waste, and the stories we leave behind. This documentary offers a unique perspective on our value of material possessions and how we conceal aspects of our lives. As we journey with Lew Blink, \"Dumpster Archaeology\" prompts reflection on the human experience, privacy, and the often overlooked narratives embedded within the refuse of our society.","popularity":0.0708,"poster_path":"/oB0ksYi0pxkCzPWW638fYRbVVA7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dumpster Archeology","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4533586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lew Blink","original_name":"Lew Blink","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65cad569cffeed0185bfd228","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4417114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dustie Carter","original_name":"Dustie Carter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65713584dfe31d00c3cdd13e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499905,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike Dalton","original_name":"Mike Dalton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2a5e1fd140b00e8a0ae74","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499909,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kiley Enno","original_name":"Kiley Enno","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2a617dbf144014a9bd4b2","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499923,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"StolenSun","original_name":"StolenSun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2a72fa1a9ba017d3f8667","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499918,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Colton Jackson","original_name":"Colton Jackson","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2a6cfa80236016daee83b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499916,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Clark Griffiths","original_name":"Clark Griffiths","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2a69ae267de0149082d25","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499920,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael LeFevre","original_name":"Michael LeFevre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2a6f62866fa017be42241","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499907,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chent","original_name":"Chent","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2a7f0b7b69d0162f42956","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499912,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jesse Bader","original_name":"Jesse Bader","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2a656dbf14401849c718b","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4417114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dustie Carter","original_name":"Dustie Carter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cad549761421017cbecd46","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31040807","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oB0ksYi0pxkCzPWW638fYRbVVA7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
