Is the \"salamander-eating contest\" staged by these students a fad or a tradition? A rite of passage for college men and women? Or an inhumane and senseless act? The film documents the ritual in cinema verit√© fashion and permits viewers to decide for themselves. Provided without narration - this short film primarily features obnoxious, loud and brawling youngsters, and develops into a competition among coeds that has strong sexual overtones.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":215248,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentary Resource Center","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salamanders: A Night at the Phi Delt House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4414593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Hornbein","original_name":"George Hornbein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f7c62886348014d861eb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4414595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Hornbein","original_name":"Marie Hornbein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f7c773dc31301387bcd54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4414593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Hornbein","original_name":"George Hornbein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f7c99568463010f84b0f3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4414598,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ken Thigpen","original_name":"Ken Thigpen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f7cc76517d6010e5ac271","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4414593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Hornbein","original_name":"George Hornbein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f7ce1946318013a8bb131","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208466,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tom Keiter","original_name":"Tom Keiter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f7cf83dc313011b3e8d16","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
