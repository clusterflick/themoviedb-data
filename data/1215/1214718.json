In fact, the hunt for hidden coastal riches has been a defining feature of the Beaver state since its earliest days. Driven by a heady mixture of indigenous eyewitness accounts of shipwrecks, archeological findings, religious faith, and far-out legends, the seekers of this booty darn well inspired The Goonies . Now, join filmmakers Tony Altamirano, JB Fisher, and Doug Kenck-Crispin as they probe deeper into recent shipwreck discoveries to expose what’s really hidden at Oregon’s spectacular Neahkahnie Mountain.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The True Quest for Fabled Treasure on the Oregon Coast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3589531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Altamirano","original_name":"Tony Altamirano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65715d3cdfe31d011aa8ba69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4417298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Doug Kenck-Crispin","original_name":"Doug Kenck-Crispin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65715ce6858678014d6fcf14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4417299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.B.
