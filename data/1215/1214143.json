Our Country (2020) came together from artists, local Original Nations young people, community members and elders. The purpose of the film was to spark conversation between generations about social and emotional well-being for young people in six communities around the north coast. It uses dialogue-based storytelling that helps subjects narrate their experience and create positive change for their communities. Our Country gives insight into the Aboriginal experience and their culture - one that is rooted in spiritual connections to the lands that they live in and from. Passing down culture and stories is a very important part of Aboriginal life, making sure that their ancestors and themselves will always be remembered for future generations to come.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Country","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4414763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toby Finlayson","original_name":"Toby Finlayson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f92aa94631800ad4b72d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4414767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Sherwood","original_name":"Rob Sherwood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f92f456846300ee14980d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4414767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Sherwood","original_name":"Rob Sherwood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f92c688055100c682ff19","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4414769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Coedie McCarthy","original_name":"Coedie McCarthy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656f92d9568463010f84b5eb","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
