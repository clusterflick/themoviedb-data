These images, in an obsessive manner, have embodied the mesmerized gaze of people. In the span of 79 years since the purchase of this camera, Iran has undergone two revolutions and two coups, and throughout all these moments, the camera has been present as the recorder of people's mesmerized gazes. These mesmerized gazes are in a way as if they are the ones looking at us, not the other way around. It seems like these gazes are trying to convey something, but what? No one knows. Now, we gaze at those who have gazed at us from a distant time.","popularity":0.2808,"poster_path":"/p2vJi42EBAMfigrrsdJkbQCkD8d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215355,"logo_path":null,"name":"4th projects","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From a distant time.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3351390,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mahshid Afzali","original_name":"Mahshid Afzali","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65711374a22d3e00c4c4bd60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4416988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Javad Ebrahiminejad","original_name":"Javad Ebrahiminejad","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/t9LJMAQ9Yr6plfaAHZzH1sM8nt5.jpg","credit_id":"65711415d363e500c7af0b09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4416988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Javad Ebrahiminejad","original_name":"Javad Ebrahiminejad","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/t9LJMAQ9Yr6plfaAHZzH1sM8nt5.jpg","credit_id":"657113657eb5f2014fea264a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28306404","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p2vJi42EBAMfigrrsdJkbQCkD8d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15126,"name":"historical"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
