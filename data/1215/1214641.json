As she ruminates about the oppressive status of the Island, her questions are left unanswered. The family of three women are forced to face the fatal reality of their surroundings after Celia's classmate, Matías, arrives at their home with his father, Emilio, who is gravely injured from a gunshot. After realizing the boy and his father are active members of the revolution, tensions arise as they decide to hide them from the police. Matías lights a spark in Celia, who rebels against her family and becomes part of the revolution.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/kay0XkYlAh5Kzci97n5C0Ia3B3r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto
