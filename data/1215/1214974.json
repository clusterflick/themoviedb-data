As days drag on, subtle shifts in his behavior and mindset become increasingly apparent, drawing the audience into his spiraling descent.  Isolation was Brandon Gupta's first movie, originally conceived as a much larger and more intricate exploration of the human mind under extreme conditions. The project was intended to stretch into a second film, expanding on the themes of confinement and psychological breakdown. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the production was scaled back, and instead, the test version of the film was released, leaving viewers with a hauntingly brief yet powerful glimpse into Gupta's vision.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":220685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Odyssey Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isolation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4412580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Gupta","original_name":"Brandon Gupta","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Man","credit_id":"65722ce2ac416100ae0e8349","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4412580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Gupta","original_name":"Brandon Gupta","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65722d1435c30a00eb37efd5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4412580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Gupta","original_name":"Brandon Gupta","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65722d096dc6c0013b41adcd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4412580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Gupta","original_name":"Brandon Gupta","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65722cfe6c8492012ccf082a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
