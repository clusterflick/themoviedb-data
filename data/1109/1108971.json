Prey are constantly finding new ways to avoid being eaten by predators it is thus crucial for the predators survival that he too finds mechanisms to outsmart his prey- it's an ever-evolving world on the African Savannah. This show examines this evolutionary process - are predators today fitter, faster and stronger than their predecessors? What gives one animal the edge over another? And how much of the animals behaviour is instinctive and how much is learnt? It's a fine balance out on the Savannah grasslands- a world that demands the very best from predator and prey.","popularity":0.1559,"poster_path":"/ovouNBAczlejR6hFRRIBtyu3WzD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197075,"logo_path":null,"name":"Londolozi Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Savage Instinct","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3990887,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anton Truesdale","original_name":"Anton Truesdale","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642ca82001b1ca00777c36c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213252,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Varty","original_name":"John Varty","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642ca827c048a90097577065","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3990887,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anton Truesdale","original_name":"Anton Truesdale","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642ca83aac8e6b3431c1af9e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3994562,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julie Lawson","original_name":"Julie Lawson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642ca844c048a9009757707a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213252,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Varty","original_name":"John Varty","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642ca849c048a900b61bc821","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8836472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ovouNBAczlejR6hFRRIBtyu3WzD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
