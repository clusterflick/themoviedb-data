Barney Desai was a political activist during South Africa's struggle for freedom, yet as a father he was absent emotionally. Rehad spent most of his young life in exile and became politically active himself. On this intensely personal journey into his past, Rehad realizes he is following in his fathers footsteps as he reviews his relationship with his own estranged teenage son.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":"/3WV2ubIam6P3v9BZfTlXxO7D3jV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2004-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Born Into Struggle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rehad Desai","original_name":"Rehad Desai","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/31O7nQasijGPtgpvPCFC0hFeieW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6429fff2a84a470112e45ec0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rehad Desai","original_name":"Rehad Desai","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/31O7nQasijGPtgpvPCFC0hFeieW.jpg","credit_id":"6429fffd6654080097f60515","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rehad Desai","original_name":"Rehad Desai","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/31O7nQasijGPtgpvPCFC0hFeieW.jpg","credit_id":"642a00140f365500f1c27e94","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145512,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bhekizizwe Peterson","original_name":"Bhekizizwe Peterson","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642a00209cc67b05796bdf92","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332466,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anita Khanna","original_name":"Anita Khanna","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d13d5f3602026906815554","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3WV2ubIam6P3v9BZfTlXxO7D3jV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1448}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
