With a moving camera reminiscent of nostalgic home videos, Josiane Pozi answers this question by filming herself and her family. Everyday reality in a digital world is captured in an abstract and fragmentary way. The banal is elevated into something weighty and valuable, with intimate living room moments as a response to the stereotypical representations of the black female body in traditional imagery. Pozi paints a sometimes uncomfortable and rather unflattering picture of herself and her mother, zooming in on family relationships, annoyances, fun and caring for each other.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zKrAzXeSe5VPrHIjrVwgA8WvZMm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Capture 03 01 18","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3993567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josiane Pozi","original_name":"Josiane Pozi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642bc19dc0a30800774ef606","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zKrAzXeSe5VPrHIjrVwgA8WvZMm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
