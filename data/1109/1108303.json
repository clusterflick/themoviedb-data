One thing is immediately clear to both of them: they want a better world for their son. So they establish a 'thrive village' in a small village in Bali. The community around the young couple grows quickly. A collective that has made it its mission to develop and promote projects that make the world a little bit better. Cooperation comes first. For many, this is also an opportunity to start over and let go of old burdens or traumas.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/AgBmCN4bDyvXXLrIzSX7GEeF1MV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For
