For centuries, farmers and their fields were part of the city, but now only one piece remains. And that is exactly where the municipality has planned huge distribution centres.  GroenLinks councillor Marieke van Doorninck defends the plans and is determined to get the business park built. Trijntje Hoogendam's organic care farm 'De Boterbloem' is to be cleared and she is resisting with everything she has. Concerned Amsterdammers come up with increasingly tough actions. How did it come to this? Why is the business park being built in the first place? And are there any alternatives?  Filmmaker Bart Melief followed the development of the business park in the Lutkemeerpolder and the protest against it for three years. With his film, he wants to record this historical event and erect a monument to a small polder in a big city.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vclFVn7uAwjOXQuNlJqJ4oPNuO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The battle for Amsterdam's last fields","title":"Meer: The battle for Amsterdam's last fields","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3992924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bart Melief","original_name":"Bart Melief","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642b1ae3c04429021306bd0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":851,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vclFVn7uAwjOXQuNlJqJ4oPNuO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER 'MEER - de strijd om de laatste akkers van Amsterdam'","key":"810066671","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-03-21T09:14:00.000Z","id":"642b1b17a3e4ba3d3e13015b"}]}}}
