Here, with their bare hands, miners dig the coltan which will find its way – legally or otherwise – to our industrialized world. For decades this grey gold, indispensable to the manufacture of almost all contemporary technological devices, has been the cause of conflicts and a bitter exploitation. In Numbi, bodies are covered in mud, hands red with blood, and coltan hides in every pocket. Every inhabitant lives with the illusory hope of escaping fate and enjoying for themselves the riches of the Congo. Sensitive, shocking and deeply moving, Of Mud and Blood documents the everyday existence of the inhabitant of Numbi, revealing the hardships and trials of a story from which we must not look away.","popularity":0.1603,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":123971,"logo_path":"/9hx0olyLulw7esUVgjkwnkZlSuc.png","name":"Valdés","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":789,"logo_path":"/rQ0fru0nm1oCsz2npnAgXEl11AH.png","name":"Pallas Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":58726,"logo_path":"/jyjhaJdl5hcOoMwajYJJgVIwX8M.png","name":"Borsalino Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Of Mud and Blood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1423726,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Hampel","original_name":"Martin Hampel","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/2Gfk5dS3IkMXvbLcq0BjzyGotiR.jpg","credit_id":"65aef575d100b6010c8285f7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343627,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Gabriel Leynaud","original_name":"Jean-Gabriel Leynaud","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aef5853e2ec8010b056265","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1003938,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laurent Baudens","original_name":"Laurent Baudens","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aef56a3e2ec8010b05625f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28391,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thanassis Karathanos","original_name":"Thanassis Karathanos","popularity":0.1308,"profile_path":"/i2JbzrdKTbSDDf38X3GEheKR2Gg.jpg","credit_id":"65aef57ef8aee800cbb0a721","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099274,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Érik Ménard","original_name":"Érik Ménard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aef58ebd588b00ca630a0f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343627,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Gabriel Leynaud","original_name":"Jean-Gabriel Leynaud","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642c3efb01b1ca00d5e96557","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343627,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Gabriel Leynaud","original_name":"Jean-Gabriel Leynaud","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642c3f019cc67b05e202ca18","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2199998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François-Xavier Destors","original_name":"François-Xavier Destors","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642c3f0ad100b600f58c2b9e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2543064,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laurent Flahault","original_name":"Laurent Flahault","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642c3f558de0ae0113511f48","department":"Production","job":"Delegated Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n1tdBc0YCF64TJUJGWLL0Mjm1Ws.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x1Z02LAp5EuLVnyUv0TRBwhNyHi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aYznjzaCvsymNQ2s0tVsbuuLZb8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
