Over time, they developed more and more specialised features, survival techniques and superior sensory abilities. They can see, smell and hear what we cannot, way beyond natural human experience. Telescopic vision. Advanced radar. Instant, wireless communications. Animal e-mail. Graphically illustrated in 3D, and filmed by the world's top wildlife cinematographers, Sense and Scentability explores the animal evolution and the phenomenal world of animal's super-senses. Dramatic footage of the hunters and the hunted, and their advanced mechanisms of defence and attack, in Africa's great wilderness areas.","popularity":0.0705,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":197075,"logo_path":null,"name":"Londolozi Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sense & Scentability","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3994568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Glynn","original_name":"Patricia Glynn","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"642ca774c0a3080111c3e23f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3841950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Taylor","original_name":"Sean Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"642ca789ac8e6b33d8d8aa52","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213252,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Varty","original_name":"John Varty","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642ca70fc048a90097577023","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213252,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Varty","original_name":"John Varty","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642ca6c48de0ae00f4c1f31d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3994562,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julie Lawson","original_name":"Julie Lawson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642ca73b01b1ca0097ff1b70","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3990887,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anton Truesdale","original_name":"Anton Truesdale","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642ca6f58de0ae0113513903","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3990887,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anton Truesdale","original_name":"Anton Truesdale","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642ca705c04429026b14cdd2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213252,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Varty","original_name":"John Varty","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642ca7268de0ae00f4c1f33d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3994539,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ian H.
