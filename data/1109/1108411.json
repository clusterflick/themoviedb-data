Like her remaining neighbours she's submitted to relentless Russian airstrikes and caught between advancing troops and extremist groups. Despite acclaim for her art, she faces threats, condemnation, and degradation, causing her to contemplate leaving. Ironically, her artwork has graced galleries in France and Italy but never received exposure within Syria's borders. The film captures her endeavor to organize her inaugural exhibition in Idlib. This experience compels her to confront the harsh realities of a city defined by bombings and male interference. While organizing drawing lessons for women and girls, comforting her young niece, and sharing her story with the documentary crew, Amany's outlook on the future gradually erodes.","popularity":0.348,"poster_path":"/z16Qovlz1wt62qIMn4AimevisNK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32223,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clin d'oeil Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":20618,"logo_path":"/yGDXyW0kQUMpraYo3f1egJSkxh4.png","name":"Les Films du Balibari","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":12340,"logo_path":"/2tgY95Di4hQhR4JUkejJWx2sN2z.png","name":"ma.ja.de.
