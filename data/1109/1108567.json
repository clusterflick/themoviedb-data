After a 16-year hiatus, they make a pact to create one last movie, but lack a youthful presence to make it marketable. This unlikely alliance leads to self-discovery through an ageless lens, showcasing the evolution of snowboarding from a young sport to a mature industry. The film also touches on the struggles of old pros finding their way in life after the glory days are gone.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/90l2Hd50t4Mmj7BqjvvlITQomio.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WashDup","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3993260,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matt
