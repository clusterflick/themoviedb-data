Rockabilly took hold around 1954. The music style is a mixture of gospel, blues, rhythm and blues, country, hillbilly and boogie woogie.The music was born swinging its way through the cotton fields. The pin-up fashion comes from the 20-30s and is a large part of the culture. It has a signature clothes style with pretty dresses and hair styled up for the women and with turned-up jeans with pomaded hair for the men. The 1950s seem bigger today than in the 1950s itself! In the film we follow the people who live in the rockabilly style.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5SjY4HchUFeHKxSSnojQBy1YaQp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rockin' 50s","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/5SjY4HchUFeHKxSSnojQBy1YaQp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
