Streets, squares, zoos, houses, roofs, men, women, roads, but all of it seen as if that world was someone else's, as if it was lost in time. The world is there, but there is no place to settle. A film that speaks about everyday’s life, but with the voice of the sleepwalkers. Some sort of blind, nocturnal continuum that no one knows for sure what it is.","popularity":0.0414,"poster_path":"/ecapdNEX0Ou1YMDNGp5mtUWU1We.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2017-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El estanque","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Fontán","original_name":"Gustavo Fontán","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/6MGwcS3YgcLuzDGbqeinPAn5gql.jpg","credit_id":"60bbfcae0bc529006f220879","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8266442","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ecapdNEX0Ou1YMDNGp5mtUWU1We.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":896}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
