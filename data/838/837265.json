Glen, a petty thief, is pretty good at karaoke. Paul, a boxer who wants to act, must deal with an image consultant. He also is trying to wheedle local car dealers into giving him a free car in exchange for his star quality. Sarah, a young mother who was recently arrested and put in jail during a Greek holiday for immoral dancing, tries to take that incident and launch a singing career. She is assisted by several unscrupulous entrepreneurs. Wayne Chadwick, a bar owner, is one of them.","popularity":0.1104,"poster_path":"/3cPWdjzXCaxOjouT6T6xJZHfrOC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108984,"logo_path":null,"name":"Picture Palace North","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales from a Hard City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3115196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glen Brodie","original_name":"Glen Brodie","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Car Thief / Karaoke King","credit_id":"60bbcc87746457002b2fb2d8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3115197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Smith","original_name":"Sarah Smith","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Dirty Dancer","credit_id":"60bbcc9fc8f858006e03448f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3115198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Wallace","original_name":"Paul Wallace","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Hustler","credit_id":"60bbccac7f2d4a005723a047","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3115199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Chadwick","original_name":"Wayne Chadwick","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Media Moghul","credit_id":"60bbccb8c2f44b0022c81643","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Flitcroft","original_name":"Kim Flitcroft","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bbcba846aed4006e1fcd70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240087,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacques Bidou","original_name":"Jacques Bidou","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/jkCiKK5XuripxBZVzhriAOVmeXN.jpg","credit_id":"60bbcbba678259007985e0fd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":71773,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Usborne","original_name":"Alex Usborne","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bbcbc52dc44e00589772ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3115190,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Carey","original_name":"Dan Carey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bbcbff746457007af4424b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766030,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paul Otter","original_name":"Paul Otter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bbcc250bc5290029e11a99","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177291,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Hatch","original_name":"Marc Hatch","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bbcc63c2f44b0022c815b2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":967482,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick Fenton","original_name":"Nick Fenton","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/nnObpDUImOr0PiNtPKlm5XNFyI9.jpg","credit_id":"60bbcc701c635b0040d16be6","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3115194,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Austin Bambrook","original_name":"Austin Bambrook","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bbcc4f0bc529006f217d64","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654599,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David G.
