Madness Remixed questions the conditions under which the skirt should be revived, considering that Beyonce, Miley Cyrus, and Diana Ross have all worn the same skirt more recently. 16mm film coated with latex and glitter – a fetishised medium in itself – is data-moshed with Baker in Siren of the Tropics (1927).","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/cxjK9ncs6yixdMsWpqkeQDNomy7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madness Remixed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1148018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Baker","original_name":"Josephine Baker","popularity":0.1376,"profile_path":"/wdSYqyqZKjM923BX7VhTuvdYRwt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"(archive footage)","credit_id":"60cbe7a442d8a5003f7c2b91","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2034200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rhea Storr","original_name":"Rhea Storr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/z2S1J5LZHRl5JgQQ7gJeA0vFkTy.jpg","credit_id":"60cbe79466ae4d002b873bce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2034200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rhea Storr","original_name":"Rhea Storr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/z2S1J5LZHRl5JgQQ7gJeA0vFkTy.jpg","credit_id":"60cbe78b6e938a00298141c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14871518","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cxjK9ncs6yixdMsWpqkeQDNomy7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sheffield Doc/Fest","release_date":"2021-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Prismatic Ground","release_date":"2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Madness Remixed Trailer","key":"4tEtwJ43Xqc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-05-17T10:00:02.000Z","id":"60cbe7e2a217c0006d061f2f"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Madness Remixed (trailer)","key":"537664380","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-16T10:52:16.000Z","id":"60cbe7eff3b49a005881453f"}]}}}
