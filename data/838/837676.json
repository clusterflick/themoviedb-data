Selvi & Daughters is the story of Selvi, a 50-year old woman in Chennai, India who is trying to get her fledgling online saree store off the ground. Like any Good Indian Mother, Selvi gave up her career aspirations for family life, and left all major decisions to her husband. Now, a year after his death, Selvi has taken her hobby of selling sarees door-to-door to the next level via Whatsapp, and is struggling with the confidence to build it into a real business. When Kavitha - Selvi's fiercely independent, idealistic daughter comes home for Pongal - she discovers her mother's secret with pleasant surprise, and runs an ad for the sari business without consulting her. Now, with close to a hundred orders to fulfill overnight, Selvi is overwhelmed. Can she do this? Is she capable of handling a business on her own? She needs to take the plunge in order to find out.","popularity":0.1341,"poster_path":"/hYfzVp5yso7AFOhZid2PqeqTFxg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125423,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stray Factory","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2020-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"B.Selvi & Daughters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":545011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kalairani","original_name":"Kalairani","popularity":0.239,"profile_path":"/lfA66R05zwvNHsLCl3KbvYHmM24.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"B.Selvi","credit_id":"60bdba2cbfeb8b0058970e73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1124450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gayathrie Shankar","original_name":"Gayathrie Shankar","popularity":0.5919,"profile_path":"/bJgZlSd5WCIi7kp3IZKS0FDjIL2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kavi","credit_id":"60bdba39eb79c2007817523a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeeva Ravi","original_name":"'Jeeva' Ravi","popularity":0.2095,"profile_path":"/72blirHJXjubWWoHUvkPpPGIv1Z.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60bdba4518b75100428b72c0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3116747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Drishya","original_name":"Drishya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bdba6305a53300292a2ba8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3116747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Drishya","original_name":"Drishya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bdba73e2586000773abfec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathivanan Rajendran","original_name":"Mathivanan Rajendran","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/zyKbgxbwu0VHUmbs6bLukEAHIuz.jpg","credit_id":"60bdba82244182005a76df7f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2460678,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tarana Reddy","original_name":"Tarana Reddy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bdba924a4bf60041a7cb83","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juhi Sharma","original_name":"Juhi Sharma","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bdbabddbad5000299dec90","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11847638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hYfzVp5yso7AFOhZid2PqeqTFxg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":904}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IFFM) 2020","release_date":"2020-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"B.Selvi & Daughters | Trailer | Stray Factory | Her & Now","key":"HnGtaMHHvFo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-08-13T10:30:13.000Z","id":"60bdbb1abfeb8b0058970f2e"}]}}}
