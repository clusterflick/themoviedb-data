Jacquelyn uses her friend's bonfire party to break free of her mother's control and explore having fun as a teenager and her desire for her best friend, Vivian; but, Jacquelyn's mother haunts her subconscious and small town mentality oppresses who she really is further. Jacquelyn is a shy, repressed person, while her best friend is popular, mature, and individualistic. The people at the party also overshadow Jacquelyn, and she must build up her confidence. She makes a move on Vivian, reveals her feelings, and crosses a line in their friendship upon which she can't return from. The film approach is surrealistic.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/rPjPcc1nmmmxOII0I1dUaGli6B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smoulder","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1912473","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rPjPcc1nmmmxOII0I1dUaGli6B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
