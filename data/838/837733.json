An unknown place and time. An anonymous, timeless man slides into a devastated industrial building. He is enclosed by ruins and rust, witnesses of time.

abyss.","popularity":0.0606,"poster_path":"/baHHNfPqXxZiJo37tnOLH7cnm93.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51654,"logo_path":"/qTkVCfQFiM0q9sYn9pXKOsZdH2B.png","name":"Momento
