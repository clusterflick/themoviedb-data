Ying Liang watched him cut out a portrait of Abbas Kiarostami from a book, and create a face mask on the face of the Iranian filmmaker. Liang observes how his son builds a ‘world’ on his bed, makes a paper airplane, and flies various places with his new friend Abbas Kiarostami. After spending the whole day flying, he falls asleep on that same bed with the family’s kitten. In his dreams, he uses the ‘magic’ he has learned from an online magic course to remove the face mask. With The World of Mindfulness, Chinese filmmaker Liang – who is now living in Hong Kong – creates a marvellously simple piece about the world of childhood, adding a touch of playful cinephilia.","popularity":0.1196,"poster_path":"/nx8bxDBlGs9YGH1TEtJW7zOU9jX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99502,"logo_path":"/nP45gRAxUu2rlMCf6sODAZF73hD.png","name":"PŌTOCOL","origin_country":"SG"},{"id":15579,"logo_path":null,"name":"90 Minutes Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2021-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World of Mindfulness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ying Liang","original_name":"Ying Liang","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/iHBdPjPqkAVlY0iihcSyavWka6n.jpg","credit_id":"60bcdb72b0460500295d1275","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1191395,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shan Peng","original_name":"Shan Peng","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cbd8dfaaec710056455552","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1617797,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeremy Chua","original_name":"Jeremy Chua","popularity":0.1358,"profile_path":"/6rlZLYkQj26jpbUOOYXNifLwdvk.jpg","credit_id":"60cbd8cfc8a5ac0079e788c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14871316","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1458,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nx8bxDBlGs9YGH1TEtJW7zOU9jX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":971}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sheffield Doc/Fest","release_date":"2021-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The World of Mindfulness Trailer","key":"eguXVM5DkIs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-05-17T06:00:10.000Z","id":"60cbd90e66ae4d002b8725ce"}]}}}
