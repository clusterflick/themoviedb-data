If you’re a fan of the first OyBaby, you’ll be happy to know that the Schneiderman Sisters return on lead vocals. They’re joined by an all-star lineup of additional musicians, including Craig Taubman and Rick Recht. OyBaby 2 is a visual treat as well, designed to appeal to children up to 5 years old.  The DVD is a colorful medley of Judaica, toys, puppets, nature, and children. Between songs, short interlude scenes teach Hebrew letters, numbers, and vocabulary and show the joy of giving tzedakah.  The music is a captivating journey of familiar songs for both babies and any nearby adults to enjoy. With popular Jewish favorites such as Shalom Rav, Modeh Ani, and Hallelujah, this is one baby video parents won’t mind watching again and again.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rq702holAA7j8gLH1fZoBramPD1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184233,"logo_path":null,"name":"OyBaby LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Oy!
