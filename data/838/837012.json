This new film imagines what the masks – now subjects, and not objects – would say. Aimé Césaire’s Discourse on Colonialism is spoken in Lingala for the first time. This speech is still a critical mirror for Europe. Under The White Mask is limited to the elements already existing in 1958.","popularity":0.0468,"poster_path":"/8KskPcRDcQbKNGyKgB91uZSHnUW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37535,"logo_path":"/vzNk435QC1zSA7DQHUV8v3QXygD.png","name":"Cobra Films","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2021-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under The White Mask: The Film That Haesaerts Could Have Made","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4498348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maravilha Munto","original_name":"Maravilha Munto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65b19069b1f68d014ad46327","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neel Cockx","original_name":"Neel Cockx","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b1907d0f2fbd013066521c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias De Groof","original_name":"Matthias De Groof","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b18fce0f2fbd014a66519e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias De Groof","original_name":"Matthias De Groof","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b18fd71c6329015292bd0c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2574707,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniël De Valck","original_name":"Daniël De Valck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b190b1b1f68d014ad4634e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias De Groof","original_name":"Matthias De Groof","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b1909adbf144016b9b3ffb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neel Cockx","original_name":"Neel Cockx","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b1908d924ce501632ee27d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8KskPcRDcQbKNGyKgB91uZSHnUW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
