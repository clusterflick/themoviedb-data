Meanwhile, news is breaking around the world that a novel virus is spreading and a state of emergency is declared across the country. As people test positive for COVID-19 in the community, some families decide to leave and head deeper into the jungle. Disconnected from school, friends, the internet, and work, one family learns to reconnect with life in the forest. The children begin to unlearn the national curriculum, and instead are taught Indigenous knowledge that mainstream schools normally pass over. As COVID-19 wreaks havoc around the planet, the family reconnect to their ancestral ways, but as news arrives that Ecuador’s lockdown will end soon, will the family choose to return?","popularity":0.2585,"poster_path":"/phdMnbLQqxjtOlfKzF9rtMgFTyY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"}],"release_date":"2021-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Quechua","iso_639_1":"qu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","title":"Tiam, el retorno","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3117518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eriberto Gualinga","original_name":"Eriberto Gualinga","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/s0XJ7OkZaNHfRscGyOc1IiubzPb.jpg","credit_id":"60be7e800721660029e02aad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3130456,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nina Gualinga","original_name":"Nina Gualinga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cef599c175b20029ad4a1d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":178460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Silver","original_name":"Marc Silver","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cef5a6a199a6006e617296","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1873052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pocho Álvarez","original_name":"Pocho Álvarez","popularity":0.2265,"profile_path":"/5tsJapKgl3ruHNbDuo9p5up5nKq.jpg","credit_id":"60f0f5958a0e9b004699c2c6","department":"Writing","job":"Story Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3159571,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jack Jones","original_name":"Jack Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f0f5cb8dbc3300297c3863","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2226713,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emma Butt","original_name":"Emma Butt","popularity":0.5385,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f0f5adf96a39005ca5d4b4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3117518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eriberto Gualinga","original_name":"Eriberto Gualinga","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/s0XJ7OkZaNHfRscGyOc1IiubzPb.jpg","credit_id":"60f0f563e942ee00461b8b80","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1543933,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emiliano Battista","original_name":"Emiliano Battista","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f0f57c64f716005d97f606","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14887748","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"wirukaraju","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5nbXyQDcwUdEG9UOll0t8X2HUJi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":839,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/phdMnbLQqxjtOlfKzF9rtMgFTyY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":559}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5968,"name":"amazon rainforest"},{"id":195405,"name":"indigenous community"},{"id":263237,"name":"covid-19"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sheffield Doc/Fest","release_date":"2021-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
