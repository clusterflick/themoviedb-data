From the isolation of her Chicago apartment, she reconstructs his annual Christmas Carol puppet show – over a Zoom call while the family celebrates Christmas Eve under lockdown. But as Trudy becomes more absorbed in her own version of the story, the puppets take on a life of their own, and the family’s call transforms into a stunning cinematic adaptation of Dickens’s classic ghost story.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/v6EyNXl8qcaYQ7NyQgiO2zlskVq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152431,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manual Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manual Cinema's Christmas Carol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v6EyNXl8qcaYQ7NyQgiO2zlskVq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
