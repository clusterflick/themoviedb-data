Skinflint, a miser, not satisfied with the gold he boards, tries to make a practice of selling whiskey to the Indians, taking from them practically all the gold they possess for just a few glasses of the fire water.

Skinflint becomes enraged and determines to get even.","popularity":0.1666,"poster_path":"/txCXgdvG8kJx91v4rqKUyB7CqOp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greed for Gold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"True Boardman","original_name":"True Boardman","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/lQCtb4xD1O6zBuW1LWNa9MaJNps.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"61c26a251f98d1001c0ddc8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2864904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Keenan","original_name":"Harry Keenan","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bill","credit_id":"61c26a371f98d1001c0ddc8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Todd","original_name":"Harry Todd","popularity":0.1268,"profile_path":"/98T2jrTJCLo39PV7XOX2BBHzmff.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Skinflint - the Miser","credit_id":"61c26a4c8b959e001bd0611c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Willard","original_name":"Lee Willard","popularity":0.1982,"profile_path":"/1bVOxQa2avhTRxulSKgF8IDdrap.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Indian","credit_id":"61c26a5ebb105700413168b8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3354908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coleman Elan","original_name":"Coleman Elan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bartender","credit_id":"61c26a7748333a0062f1ab74","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Ingraham","original_name":"Lloyd Ingraham","popularity":0.1387,"profile_path":"/rt2FD3CxxiBDcyQAUvyb9P0OasY.jpg","credit_id":"61c269fea93d250041391bf4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0207497","wikidata_id":"Q15103590","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/txCXgdvG8kJx91v4rqKUyB7CqOp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
