This prompts him to go out upon a \"job\" so that he may secure money to give his mother a funeral. In the meantime the policeman's wife has left their baby in a department store and the child was handed over to the cop at the closing hour. The policeman did not recognize his own baby, and while on the way to the station, he ran into the robbery. The crook, however, jumped into the policeman's taxi and found the baby on the seat. A chase takes place that ends in a smash-up. The crook saves the baby from the flames of the burning car, and only later does the policeman discover that it was his own child.","popularity":0.1893,"poster_path":"/htE3gEYYg5rnmHOfKVXBArxZg7i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig-Rork Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Policeman and the Baby","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1256044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Desmond","original_name":"William Desmond","popularity":0.1482,"profile_path":"/4ZrHPcaKiybXcApPdG7bF29xvwO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Policeman","credit_id":"61c268a648333a00428d05b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elinor Fair","original_name":"Elinor Fair","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":"/obwXPqtyOjRsQjE16nKl3aNUd2c.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Policeman's Wife","credit_id":"61c268b421621d006472826a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Beery","original_name":"Wallace Beery","popularity":0.2342,"profile_path":"/v8cHzbuHEqNUYmO7Oj66Im424uR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Crook","credit_id":"61c268c16332f70096ac936a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3354903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Neidlinger","original_name":"Jack Neidlinger","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Policeman's Baby","credit_id":"61c268cdbb1057004131650f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1254690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bertram Bracken","original_name":"Bertram Bracken","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c2688548333a00428d0547","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3354902,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Clarence L.
