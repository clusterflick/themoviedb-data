One night she panned him to a whisper for not showing up at one of her shindigs, so he promised to be on hand for the next one. Sometime later Mrs. Clymer railed the hens one afternoon for a musical. Hubby happened home early, so nothing would do but he must get gussied up and entertain the ladies. There was one young grass widow present who looked mighty good to hubby. His wife had told him to pay some attention to her lady friends, so he extended himself. Before sending the widow home he got her address and told her he kind of wished he was single. Mrs. Clymer got his number and forbade him to ever show up at another one of her parties.","popularity":0.1965,"poster_path":"/p3r60YS3q4pJdROf6oQYFlwgXOq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fable of the Husband Who Showed Up and Did His Duty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Travers","original_name":"Richard Travers","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/ibXu8PEoEZXQEAt6NjRbMYH1V6m.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Clymer","credit_id":"61c0a9b6e24b93001caf4858","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Dunbar","original_name":"Helen Dunbar","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":"/nErEJVdKwRlDuOH6rcBx5isXKWL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Clymer","credit_id":"61c0a9c51056110061010703","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1615194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerda Holmes","original_name":"Gerda Holmes","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/iHiqQVf4VBLBanpfm1Ao8BICCSB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Young Widow","credit_id":"61c0a9d185b1050042077857","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363921,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Ade","original_name":"George Ade","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c0a99e6517d6001a527a79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363921,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Ade","original_name":"George Ade","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c0a9a7e24b930096db45b3","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003917","wikidata_id":"Q3986925","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/p3r60YS3q4pJdROf6oQYFlwgXOq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
