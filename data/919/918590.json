They arrive home and dinner is about to be served. Sweedy never reaches the table, however, for her foot slips and the expected dinner flies away. Sweedy then starts to clean house, but she gets in wrong by raising clouds of dust. Sweedy now starts to do more cooking, but gets a note from the iceman saying he will meet her on the comer and go for a lark. Sweedy takes the wife's new gown and goes to keep the appointment. Hubby discovers the note, thinks his wife is false, follows and brings Sweedy home, where, in the parlor, he protests against such treatment and declares his love in hot terms, which is overheard by the wife. She steps in and the astonished husband discovers his terrible mistake.","popularity":0.1926,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nestor Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Capable Lady Cook","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Beery","original_name":"Wallace Beery","popularity":0.2342,"profile_path":"/v8cHzbuHEqNUYmO7Oj66Im424uR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sweedie","credit_id":"61c22cc4a8858700899ee380","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kewpie Morgan","original_name":"Kewpie Morgan","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/vev7Ak06wmKc4kx4Jpsjy5xVRUJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Husband","credit_id":"61c22cd23fe7970087536034","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Belle Bennett","original_name":"Belle Bennett","popularity":0.174,"profile_path":"/otpvRREm8YtrXyyILwWxBvvZrdN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Wife","credit_id":"61c22cdf8b959e006492d267","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Moreno","original_name":"Antonio Moreno","popularity":0.3889,"profile_path":"/swsEgnc8bkILLcOjUDPGtZdXnQs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Ice Man","credit_id":"61c22cfc54508d001a00f9c4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Wulze","original_name":"Harry Wulze","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c22cb5efd3c20087fbdd40","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Beery","original_name":"Wallace Beery","popularity":0.2342,"profile_path":"/v8cHzbuHEqNUYmO7Oj66Im424uR.jpg","credit_id":"61c22cab5ff34e001c83b1cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0219576","wikidata_id":"Q15865361","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
