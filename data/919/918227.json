Such a feud is in progress between the men of the desert when Jack, a nomadic cowboy, wanders into the scene. He is outspoken against the outlawry, and the sheriff, in jest, hands him his badge and asks him if he can do any better. Jack accepts the challenge and arrests one of the most recent slayers.","popularity":0.1288,"poster_path":"/vgYItfQHc1jabUrJPyZ6HR6HW5J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":58521,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perfection Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men of the Desert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Gardner","original_name":"Jack Gardner","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jack","credit_id":"61c1236e006b0100883412bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1564148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth King","original_name":"Ruth King","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":"/tKxxtX1EGa42lMekpudVu0z8TtO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"May","credit_id":"61c1237fefd3c2001c2a2d59","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Stockdale","original_name":"Carl Stockdale","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":"/y642LERKLtOlqTjcckH8oWDVBGb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mason","credit_id":"61c1238ce10f4600419ea97f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Woodruff","original_name":"Bert Woodruff","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/5zypi4quf8pSeDpMqkbBcmHm7CS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61c1239609dda40068335bd5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3354005,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ed Gaylor","original_name":"Ed Gaylor","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c12355bb105700412f30e8","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"W.S.
