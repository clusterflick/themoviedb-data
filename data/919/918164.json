In despair she went to a wise married woman who told her she had the wrong system, that she should talk about the men. \"The Fable of the Sarcastic Husband and the Lady Shopper\" is about a \"lady\" who spent the entire day shopping at top speed, then brought home a small spool of thread.","popularity":0.0818,"poster_path":"/7hqlj1bKu397T7tHwpYTkbuRjB4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Pop-Up Fables","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363921,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Ade","original_name":"George Ade","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c102926517d600961753d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0004738","wikidata_id":"Q4001093","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7hqlj1bKu397T7tHwpYTkbuRjB4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
