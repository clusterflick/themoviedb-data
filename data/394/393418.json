Ahmet, you need to eat more. Double meals.” Like other boys their age, Baran, Ahmet and their classmates wrestle with the desire for recognition, with homesickness and with their target weights. Most of all though, they wrestle with, and against, one another. They are comrades and competitors, united by one and the same dream: Olympic gold! In their wrestling academy in the Turkish province of Amasya, which is well known for this traditional form of combat sport, they undergo strength and endurance training, they learn lifts and throws, they urge each other on and they console one another. Always responding to the boys’ needs, the trainers give the boys tough love, sometimes fatherly, sometimes strict and disciplinary. The film’s intimate documental camera bears close witness to the fine line between friendship and competition, victory and the lesson of how to lose.","popularity":0.1185,"poster_path":"/9Yo1qtMRXFybBNELs8eW8r8UEym.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75676,"logo_path":null,"name":"ret film","origin_country":""},{"id":75677,"logo_path":null,"name":"roni film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2016-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Young Wrestlers","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muhammed Ceylan","original_name":"Muhammed Ceylan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5714a6839251413616002c3e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beytullah Onur","original_name":"Beytullah Onur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5714a697c3a368667800bc56","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harun Kılıç","original_name":"Harun Kılıç","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5714a6a3c3a368412200fa7b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baran Kendirlioğlu","original_name":"Baran Kendirlioğlu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5714a6b2c3a368667800bc64","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607367,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Barlas Tan Özemek","original_name":"Barlas Tan Özemek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5714a76cc3a3685370011836","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385781,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Willem Baptist","original_name":"Willem Baptist","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5714a74492514151cf004dfe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607366,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aslıhan Ünaldı","original_name":"Aslıhan Ünaldı","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5714a70d925141387d005180","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1607373,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ali Aga","original_name":"Ali Aga","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5714a97cc3a368412200fb2c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980265,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mete Gümürhan","original_name":"Mete Gümürhan","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5714a6f7925141387d005176","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980265,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mete Gümürhan","original_name":"Mete Gümürhan","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5714a6dd9251414a71004ab3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187986,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"André Jäger","original_name":"André Jäger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5714a78c925141522700071e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4182282","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":1081,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jrj7VIBrld4JhpBuuYVVGrIH1P9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hnngIutIV6sN0Qft2vn9GK3QaYN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9Yo1qtMRXFybBNELs8eW8r8UEym.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":709},{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/2YMQX3G2ogW4OWhRW4P9juTkfkt.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":844}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10683,"name":"coming of age"},{"id":161643,"name":"sport competition"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
