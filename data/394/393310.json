It was broadcast in January, 1968, and subsequently has been seen throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States. Apart from the technical aspect of the project, their intention was to develop a widened consciousness of the communi - cative process inherent in visual images. They selected as source material the \"monuments\" of world culture— images of famous persons and paintings.","popularity":1.249,"poster_path":"/qA5o3m9OkdsU8ETzG1nDuJKuUdg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129765,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orbit","origin_country":""},{"id":9138,"logo_path":"/k7txH8XTs9BZwmTK6Drhjvt2ipu.png","name":"Sveriges Radio","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1967-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A TV experiment with super celebrities.","title":"Monument","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1244033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bengt Feldreich","original_name":"Bengt Feldreich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self -
