The film traces their transformational journeys from soldiers committed to armed battle to non-violent peace activists.  It is a story of the human potential unleashed when we stop participating in a story that no longer serves us, and with the power of our convictions take action to create a new possibility.","popularity":0.4461,"poster_path":"/y8HSExqHOGE0E1WXurNISknvnmM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reconsider","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disturbing the Peace","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chen Alon","original_name":"Chen Alon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"571454b0c3a368537801077d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sulaiman Khatib","original_name":"Sulaiman Khatib","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"571454c89251414a19003c17","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Apkon","original_name":"Stephen Apkon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57179597c3a3687fd6000f25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Young","original_name":"Andrew Young","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f0830192514158d00081a1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117842,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Blake Leyh","original_name":"Blake Leyh","popularity":0.1312,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f082e39251415a0200825c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687864,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ori Derdikman","original_name":"Ori Derdikman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f08308c3a3683c0c0078d7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Young","original_name":"Andrew Young","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5faa93e375c000141c14dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5503512","wikidata_id":"Q24686370","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fV2awX0zCVU4r1LBc5L842ojQdr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y8HSExqHOGE0E1WXurNISknvnmM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":537,"name":"palestine"},{"id":5307,"name":"peace work"},{"id":4108,"name":"protest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Traverse City Film Festival","release_date":"2016-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Disturbing the Peace Trailer (2016) - Documentary","key":"A95PDQWr4xs","published_at":"2016-09-08T18:39:01.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"57d459c292514130b3000135"}]}}}
