No one explains the odd comings and goings, the big black cars, the men in suits and hats, the overheard snippets of conversation, but that doesn't stop the children from imagining. The Safe House is a half-hour animation based on a true story - a young girl's innocent perspective of one of the most talked about moments in Australia's history - the real-life spy drama known as the Petrov Affair.","popularity":0.1418,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Safe House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noni Hazlehurst","original_name":"Noni Hazlehurst","popularity":0.3211,"profile_path":"/yFWx4q5vr3AaSRzeKRI4uZtP2dz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57134875c3a3686636005cc6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Whitmore","original_name":"Lee Whitmore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571348029251414a19001080","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0796357","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
