They love their beautiful new home, and decide to throw a party. The party is partly to show off their new digs and partly because Barry, an actor, wants to butter up the producer of a soap opera in hopes that his character won't be killed off. But the O'Briens soon discover that they have to worry about death in the real world too, because a flock of demons is hiding out in one of the closets, waiting to be released.","popularity":0.981,"poster_path":"/xbFDFER7dGNvNpGqB6O1MxKXeJV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deadlock","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Hendry","original_name":"Aaron Hendry","popularity":0.3691,"profile_path":"/lOA25S5b1fkBL6fnG3u33mFtTdE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Barry O'Brien","credit_id":"6349771ff1759c007fbfdcff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1333597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Beauchamp","original_name":"Michelle Beauchamp","popularity":0.163,"profile_path":"/h8MenEtqJewMQwwX8RvhGEBDU42.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Susan O'Brien","credit_id":"5714c0a29251412d72001187","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Chapin","original_name":"Stuart Chapin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/jVMsmwP3k71zUVECeQ2PNtl1PEH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rick O'Brien","credit_id":"6349770bb0460500791af805","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3740131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanessa Chapin","original_name":"Vanessa Chapin","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Ellen O'Brien","credit_id":"6349781e414291009882262f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1098757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Alexander","original_name":"Natalie Alexander","popularity":0.2953,"profile_path":"/z4hP8gn6saBF9VqfbtY12SYrMnj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Carpenter","credit_id":"5714c090c3a3686521001104","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":120311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gale Garnett","original_name":"Gale Garnett","popularity":0.1505,"profile_path":"/1c6Szam9NxVv8WNTQPpN66eW7nS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Maureen Robinson","credit_id":"63497743072166008dca6bbf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1227898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Griffin","original_name":"John Griffin","popularity":0.5419,"profile_path":"/5RXD2BgFGJV0Pd61oDVLy7rme2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"John Robinson","credit_id":"63497796481382009dea20a0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony De Longis","original_name":"Anthony De Longis","popularity":0.523,"profile_path":"/diSeADBcychtSiDsXlrpdth5u7f.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Edward (\"Woody\") Wood","credit_id":"634978015aadc40082bc3685","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3740132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy L.
