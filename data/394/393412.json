The two girls begin their friendship as penpals, sharing the similarities and differences of life in the two refugee camps. Mona and Manar are finally able to meet face-to-face at the Lebanese-Israeli border during Israel's withdrawal from South Lebanon. But when the second intifada suddenly erupts around them shortly thereafter, both girls must face heart-breaking changes in their lives.","popularity":0.1352,"poster_path":"/A7aJufllZzvWoOLM95WC65f3TKz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75551,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arab Film Distribution","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frontiers of Dreams and Fears","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","title":"Hlam al-manfa","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manar Faraj","original_name":"Manar Faraj","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57149ed192514105a8002207","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mona Zaaroura","original_name":"Mona Zaaroura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"57149ed99251413616002ae0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604800,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anouar Brahem","original_name":"Anouar Brahem","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581fc90ac617c090914a040","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1432647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mai Masri","original_name":"Mai Masri","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/qjbYoQAuirNaWN6kXpBBkGrhCtK.jpg","credit_id":"57149e86c3a36860a800f1fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Khalil Chamoun","original_name":"Jean Khalil Chamoun","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57149e989251413616002ad4","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1432647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mai Masri","original_name":"Mai Masri","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/qjbYoQAuirNaWN6kXpBBkGrhCtK.jpg","credit_id":"57149ea79251415227000568","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607352,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jimmy Michel","original_name":"Jimmy Michel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57149eb6c3a368673d00a201","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607353,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hussein Nassar","original_name":"Hussein Nassar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57149ec1c3a3686521000b0a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0477653","wikidata_id":"Q25463328","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jwrJy4fmVYh4ExyFQFfNoztDLUy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A7aJufllZzvWoOLM95WC65f3TKz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.762,"height":1535,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2cTPxhCpkIbXUp6j6eQmjoQqDtv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1170}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"10","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Netflix","release_date":"2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
