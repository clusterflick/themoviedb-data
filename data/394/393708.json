Monsieur Tesson has the habits of a lonely man: he is maniacal and misogynistic. To teach him a lesson, a couple of friends, the Cymboles, come to his house with a young woman, \"Mademoiselle Anaïs\", without telling him that she is married. Disturbed in his habits by visitors, Mr. Tesson welcomes them reluctantly. But gradually, a feeling of love for Anaïs leads her to give up her manic behavior. The three friends, judging that the joke has gone on long enough, end up letting go of him, pushing him away alone with his cat.","popularity":0.0849,"poster_path":"/djv00CHWgbPtEC9H83bgxEsdVnJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1923-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Édouard Georg À Cély","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4203465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Édouard Goerg","original_name":"Édouard Goerg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zDO3SnZcTFbZKnXSAvu2p7WYMll.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Monsieur Tesson","credit_id":"64d1cbb3945d36011c3d7d8f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Sauvage","original_name":"André Sauvage","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/aaOsm5G9PWpMnkGuBj54tNMmQ0Z.jpg","credit_id":"57174fe5c3a3687fd600077b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Sauvage","original_name":"André Sauvage","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/aaOsm5G9PWpMnkGuBj54tNMmQ0Z.jpg","credit_id":"64d1d89385090f00ae84c9be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oOZi5J0mbgAqSfPsIqNeIk75pdj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/djv00CHWgbPtEC9H83bgxEsdVnJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1923-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
