But director, artist, animator and all-round firework of a man Len Lye specialised in the unexpected. A simple tale of a mother cheering up her daughter with a pie from her rationing-stricken pantry (interestingly the war is never directly referred to) is skilfully crafted into a work of real artistic depth, while retaining an unpretentious charm.","popularity":0.0704,"poster_path":"/tz1sxleMPuFNGRh0A3zb12f2CTh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Realist Films Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":6309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministry of Information","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":76351,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1941-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Pie Was Opened","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Forrest","original_name":"Valerie Forrest","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"The Girl","credit_id":"57126c62c3a36831e1007784","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilda Masters","original_name":"Hilda Masters","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The Mother","credit_id":"57126c6d9251412b88000fc7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Len Lye","original_name":"Len Lye","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/rGNL1Bzvje4x7wWxtapS3en2NVO.jpg","credit_id":"57126c82c3a368537000adb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1920790,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"A.
