To accomplish this, Dr. Dyer takes the audience through a journey into the seven faces of intention - 1: creativity, 2: kindness; 3: love, 4: beauty, 5: expansiveness, 6: abundance, and 7: receptivity. Throughout the program, Dr. Dyer illustrates his points with signature stories that move the audience to tears--as well as abundant laughter.","popularity":0.4602,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hay House","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Learning to Co-Create Your World Your Way","title":"Wayne Dyer: The Power of Intention","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Power Of Intention","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Dyer","original_name":"Wayne Dyer","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/xVJFf5dMVWH2dYMXHSO67ivhzTf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5711bc19c3a36860a8006e7e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tedd Tramaloni","original_name":"Tedd Tramaloni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5711be99925141322d00589c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tedd Tramaloni","original_name":"Tedd Tramaloni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5711bea9c3a36841220070d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Niki Vettel","original_name":"Niki Vettel","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5711bec19251415f3d001b8f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606418,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dennis Allen","original_name":"Dennis Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5711bed7c3a36831e1005e0c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":490,"name":"philosophy"},{"id":195730,"name":"self-help"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS Special","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
