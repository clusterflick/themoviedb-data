As women entered the workforce in greater numbers during WWII, their young children were cared for by others. At day nurseries, trained staff supervised childrenâ€™s meals, health and play. Toddlers are taught how to wash and dress themselves and to put their toys away tidily. The film is an intriguing portrait of the nascent mid-20th century world of work for women and their families. - NFB","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1943-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before They Are Six","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1352220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gudrun Parker","original_name":"Gudrun Parker","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5716f4899251414e7c00175c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5989580","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
