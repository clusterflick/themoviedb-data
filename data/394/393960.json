First we watch what would happen if a private detective behaved at home as he does in the movies; it's a ticket to a domestic disturbance. Next, a son gets to treat his father the way his father treats him. In the third episode, to a shopkeeper's chagrin, a man shops for a hat the way a woman does. In the final sketch, we suppose a household in which the man gets pregnant and has a baby, while the mom, clueless about little children, is the one with the career.","popularity":0.4398,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Suppose","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Smith","original_name":"Pete Smith","popularity":0.2487,"profile_path":"/gVw7tr02hGeUxfzQKNAZTCtHPFh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5b08031b0e0a267b72005ce1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Brodie","original_name":"Don Brodie","popularity":0.1682,"profile_path":"/c7TYmYAdPG8B9WG5PnUxs6V5R2U.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Men's Hat Shop Proprietor (uncredited)","credit_id":"5b380c92c3a3685328044adb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave O'Brien","original_name":"Dave O'Brien","popularity":0.1641,"profile_path":"/15LzlUysJ66GEfZpRWz8EuwHfZG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Husband (uncredited)","credit_id":"5b380ca5c3a3685326045b9b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Short","original_name":"Dorothy Short","popularity":0.0979,"profile_path":"/muMcmsk2kjiyNNmuEfBJ8CfGPZU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Wife (uncredited)","credit_id":"5b380cb8c3a368531d03e9dc","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave O'Brien","original_name":"Dave O'Brien","popularity":0.1641,"profile_path":"/15LzlUysJ66GEfZpRWz8EuwHfZG.jpg","credit_id":"5b0802bcc3a3683da30081ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537765,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joseph Dietrick","original_name":"Joseph Dietrick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b380d2ac3a3685332035200","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave O'Brien","original_name":"Dave O'Brien","popularity":0.1641,"profile_path":"/15LzlUysJ66GEfZpRWz8EuwHfZG.jpg","credit_id":"5b380cec9251413c9303b29e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361776,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Harry McAfee","original_name":"Harry McAfee","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b380d3bc3a368533503cb5d","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028240,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Ansen","original_name":"Joe Ansen","popularity":0.1064,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b380cde0e0a263fff03a6dd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Smith","original_name":"Pete Smith","popularity":0.2487,"profile_path":"/gVw7tr02hGeUxfzQKNAZTCtHPFh.jpg","credit_id":"5b380d00c3a368531a038134","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96427,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Vogel","original_name":"Paul Vogel","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e50c43435811d001553b795","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0343880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5629,"name":"role reversal"},{"id":215325,"name":"what if"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
