Probably the most celebrated American poet of the twentieth Century, Frost in his mid eighties is seen in three seasons walking the landscape while he is heard reading from about twenty-five of his poems inspired by what is shown. We hear all or part of “October,” “The Sound of Trees,” “Unharvested,” “Birches,” “The Road Not Taken,” “Gathering Leaves,” “Flower-Gathering,” “Good-Bye and Keep Cold,” “The Onset,” “Two Tramps in Mud Time,” “Mending Wall,” and “The Pasture,” among others. In one sequence Mr. Frost is seen in a college seminar answering questions from students. The nature photography of New England is outstanding, as is the quality of this print, mastered in high definition from the original negative.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robert Frost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52748,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert Frost","original_name":"Robert Frost","popularity":0.0443,"profile_path":"/q7GXT1b0ZyRF0Aocux5cDrYqYBD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5718d17fc3a3687b8c004443","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sidney J.
