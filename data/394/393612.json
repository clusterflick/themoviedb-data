Standing on the perimeter of Rome like a monolith in the open countryside is a municipal housing complex from the 70s: Corviale. This ravaged concrete structure, which stretches for over a kilometer, has become the embodiment of a failed utopia from an urban planner's drawing board. The film interweaves the vistas of this fascinating architectural monstrosity with the ways the inhabitants see their living space.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il palazzo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1402542","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
