Meanwhile a mysterious yet violent girl named Josephine (Paula Solinger) holds the box while on the run from the deranged cult she once belonged to. Hot on her trail are two crooked cops (Fred Doss and Stephen Brodie) and a psychotic bounty hunter named Coffin. Their paths ultimately collide in an explosion of blood soaked chaos, leaving our anti-heroes to decide whether this box is worth their lives.","popularity":0.3995,"poster_path":"/bCk2fl1v8mRZR9ZV4kGmdDw7HfT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood Sombrero","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Gomez","original_name":"Nick Gomez","popularity":0.4512,"profile_path":"/uisJPIPCYd2cwFGmVjTsyKuLK4s.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57158470c3a368673d00c941","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Proctor","original_name":"Tom Proctor","popularity":0.2778,"profile_path":"/8ClnmTQE2OhUrpObFipRSXhByFR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Coffin","credit_id":"571584849251414b41000b89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1170889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Marcenaro Solinger","original_name":"Paula Marcenaro Solinger","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/ds7reJVanLN8eiTIvgnQ7gClRM7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Josephine","credit_id":"57158497c3a368667800e771","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":968889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Blair","original_name":"Billy Blair","popularity":0.3108,"profile_path":"/xEa5EA6K8b5jqfb0G4iW8UJGH2p.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Thief","credit_id":"571584a89251410fa4001592","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1736738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Brodie","original_name":"Stephen Brodie","popularity":0.2016,"profile_path":"/v9kSBXaF584bBYkp2JPuT7pCWbU.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Detective Randolph Carter","credit_id":"590925f79251411cfb001e93","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1082358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cassie Shea Watson","original_name":"Cassie Shea Watson","popularity":0.2539,"profile_path":"/o7rvIUAdCOWX3dUpwWxvGR0ygm6.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Kaziah","credit_id":"5a874f78c3a36863e703f612","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1414790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheri Davis","original_name":"Sheri Davis","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":"/w5Ev1Fi3IUE1jKVRxxgLPPtlmDg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Guerrera","credit_id":"571584bf92514105a80048b9","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Norfolk","original_name":"Chuck Norfolk","popularity":0.0565,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619de98f5e1200008df4c6c1","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951841,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"David Jeter","original_name":"David Jeter","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a3095e3d4d9600640aef88","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951841,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"David Jeter","original_name":"David Jeter","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a309c4c5c1ef0045f6e38b","department":"Camera","job":"Grip"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607708,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jennifer Michelle Stone II","original_name":"Jennifer Michelle Stone II","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5715825d92514105a800481d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607708,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jennifer Michelle Stone II","original_name":"Jennifer Michelle Stone II","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571582549251417a220015a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abel Berry","original_name":"Abel Berry","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5715826b9251417a220015ac","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abel Berry","original_name":"Abel Berry","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571582279251417a22001595","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3603104","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bCk2fl1v8mRZR9ZV4kGmdDw7HfT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1065}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Blood Sombrero -
