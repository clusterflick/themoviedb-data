Dedicated to mountaineering in the Mont Blanc massif, this documentary is a performance that earned him the recognition of his peers. André Sauvage and his companions decide to climb the Grépon, the best known of the Aiguilles de Chamonix, in the Mont Blanc Massif. Early in the morning, they cross the Mer de Glace, climb rocky peaks, abseil summits, cross crevasses, snowfields and long seracs. After sixteen hours of effort, the climbers return to the refuge. With his camera, Sauvage documents the difficult undertaking, also showing his strong passion for the mountains. \"The deepest perception of mountains begins where intelligence ends.\" (A. Sauvage). Two long versions of the film have disappeared, one of 90 and the other of 51 minutes and only eight minutes are preserved.","popularity":0.282,"poster_path":"/dYKRXH50ANt1tz3omJtD4F121d0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mondial Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1923-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Traversée du Grépon","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4203371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustave-Alfred Couttet","original_name":"Gustave-Alfred Couttet","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/eao95MUm8W3SX4ElIDrdMxgRhnA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d1a8da4d679100acf1d647","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Sauvage","original_name":"André Sauvage","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/aaOsm5G9PWpMnkGuBj54tNMmQ0Z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d1a8f4945d3600e26707e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4203372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc Couttet","original_name":"Luc Couttet","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d1a99185090f00c87e4e53","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1995757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Tedesco","original_name":"Jean Tedesco","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d1aa2985090f010692ba1b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Sauvage","original_name":"André Sauvage","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/aaOsm5G9PWpMnkGuBj54tNMmQ0Z.jpg","credit_id":"57174b56c3a3687fd60006fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3683246,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Georges Tairraz II","original_name":"Georges Tairraz II","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iy598sa3blmE2v5jUYDSUXIzi3p.jpg","credit_id":"64d1a8af6d4c97012e8c46c3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Sauvage","original_name":"André Sauvage","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/aaOsm5G9PWpMnkGuBj54tNMmQ0Z.jpg","credit_id":"64d1a8a26d4c97012e8c46be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaston Chelle","original_name":"Gaston Chelle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d1a971c3bffe00c665a0ab","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3586860","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5SyUVrbDEctfkerMxDbjyWh5DMQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dYKRXH50ANt1tz3omJtD4F121d0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":215368,"name":"chamonix"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":266669,"name":"alpes"},{"id":307663,"name":"mountain pioneer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1923-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
