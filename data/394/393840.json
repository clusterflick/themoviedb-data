A follow-up to JAGUAR, PETIT À PETIT, and COCORICO MONSIEUR POULET! – undertaken with his longtime filmmaking partners Damouré Zika, Lam Ibrahima Dia, and Tallou Mouzourane – Rouch’s feature is a surreal tale of mythic proportions, full of antic humor and poetic digressions. But beyond the laughs and reveries, MADAME L’EAU is also a poignant commentary on the ‘poisoned gifts’ brought to West Africa by development projects. As Faye Ginsburg once remarked, this is a film about what the world would look like “if Jean Rouch was the president of the World Bank.”\" - Anthology Film Archives","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madame l'eau","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damouré Zika","original_name":"Damouré Zika","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/8z2T5TRYdYRlinSQO94rNuCdFCf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"571860369251411b0900316e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lam Ibrahim Dia","original_name":"Lam Ibrahim Dia","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"571860429251412b37002d7b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tallou Mouzourane","original_name":"Tallou Mouzourane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5718604e925141282f003023","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wineke Onstwedder","original_name":"Wineke Onstwedder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"57186069c3a3686c830034f6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Rouch","original_name":"Jean Rouch","popularity":0.2114,"profile_path":"/808sK0h9rZ5ljP2bOxyyvLmbDn7.jpg","credit_id":"57199325c3a368526e000a76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0107476","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1993-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
