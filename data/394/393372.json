Haunted, sleepless, and desperate, she agrees to a blind date set up by a friend. The man she meets, a handsome actor, is used to having women fall in love with him. Attracted by his intelligence and naive gamesmanship, Lydia enters into a deadly serious bargain with the 'professional liar' trying to seduce her: She do whatever he asks as he tries to make her fall in love with him. As they 'go through the motions' of being lovers, they interrogate their own frustrated desires and masochistic dynamic in witty and wounded dialogue. Perhaps history can repeat itself, but to what end?","popularity":0.1161,"poster_path":"/ob1mMVbajPVnr6cgU6zM23AZFy6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":258468,"logo_path":null,"name":"Difference Films","origin_country":""},{"id":258469,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lateral Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Exchange","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1754992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massimiliano Belsito","original_name":"Massimiliano Belsito","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":"/w2V9F0hjR7UtPfHOpzxiTJ3kbNo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Max","credit_id":"67eff06fede8d82f3bad24e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2383854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Guiol","original_name":"Françoise Guiol","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/wvbPYsfCE3hnbmpiF0dbGi08DD6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lydia","credit_id":"67eff0b4aa77e08af7994862","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1572626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryne Bertieaux","original_name":"Maryne Bertieaux","popularity":0.1771,"profile_path":"/gGOuXL3KMahHFw4sGd5PhMFbKw9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Claire","credit_id":"67eff0ff8b1f32eb79d92859","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5348997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Krief","original_name":"Rachel Krief","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Andrea","credit_id":"67eff115aa77e08af7994881","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607295,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cynthia Mitchell","original_name":"Cynthia Mitchell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57145de9c3a368673d00940c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1677523,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert Arnold","original_name":"Robert Arnold","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57d55041c3a3681297000c23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3581704","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ob1mMVbajPVnr6cgU6zM23AZFy6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
