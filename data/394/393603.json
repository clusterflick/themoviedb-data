After being caught on video failing to stand and recite the pledge of allegiance, he knocks out another House member, confronts his angry ex-wife, and faces denunciation by the media for attacking one of the most cherished patriotic symbols in America. As his life spirals out of control, Charlie embarks on a journey to a remote island in the Atlantic whose eccentric inhabitants are in the middle of a shooting war over their fishing grounds. Treat Williams stars as The Congressman in this humorous and moving film that raises the important question of what it means to be an American.","popularity":1.7628,"poster_path":"/aiS2gDecKnJOEUcYnLCRm01EF9B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Congressman","video":false,"vote_average":6.25,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Catatonk Blues","type":"Also Known As"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Treat Williams","original_name":"Treat Williams","popularity":1.3039,"profile_path":"/jbRMOU2K7ePg7Zs59nfgEYLeD1e.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Charlie Winship","credit_id":"57166704c3a368673d00f86e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":126713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Marvel","original_name":"Elizabeth Marvel","popularity":1.7525,"profile_path":"/v4IQWrOTuiqoNr79FZiCKJY37Yt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rae Blanchard","credit_id":"5ac25b7fc3a3682d3501fddb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Merriman","original_name":"Ryan Merriman","popularity":0.746,"profile_path":"/a0UG62yrO9BXl7udxPNASUfnGIU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jared Barnes","credit_id":"5ac25b9892514126c301dcd1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3026599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Conroy","original_name":"Chris Conroy","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/9Nmvd9iZRUgf4nfozaoHWJec0Tb.jpg","cast_id":27,"character":"Ben","credit_id":"61c8f6b4f5f1c50061b9046d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Hamilton","original_name":"George Hamilton","popularity":1.0481,"profile_path":"/za0jt4pZEjHf3kzUecbIC6hpX7I.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Laird Devereaux","credit_id":"5ac25be2c3a3682d1a01e615","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Bell","original_name":"Marshall Bell","popularity":0.7846,"profile_path":"/3AdZRUFlmV9KvArzqSVEVZVl0Sa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sherm Hawkins","credit_id":"5716674c9251413d300000de","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Weaver","original_name":"Fritz Weaver","popularity":0.4751,"profile_path":"/gjudPIeWyMJaxDvkRgx0HoTf2zG.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Harlan Lantier","credit_id":"5ac25bfcc3a368443f05f673","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jayne Atkinson","original_name":"Jayne Atkinson","popularity":0.9064,"profile_path":"/9IOlElVs5FxWLdW6mnfToHaOxY7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Casey Winship","credit_id":"5716672b92514146c8004abc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Blacklock","original_name":"Kim Blacklock","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Matty Pierce","credit_id":"5ac25c1b0e0a260c1401f9b0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Mostel","original_name":"Josh Mostel","popularity":0.5722,"profile_path":"/zX8vyQ9JdWsr1cmPvvyrw01aPiQ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Bernie Gimpel","credit_id":"5ac25c35925141601505c629","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2013707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cindy Lentol","original_name":"Cindy Lentol","popularity":0.1154,"profile_path":"/xyJqsSlesOnUFyerzxSg6bZK6w6.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Holly Dean","credit_id":"5ac25c4cc3a3682d660239ec","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":570284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam A.
