That's Avram's big-time idea: he returns to Romania to start breeding watch dogs which he can later export to Italy. As it happens, he settles next to a camp of immigrants recently sent back from Rome. Thus, the Italian tension is willy-nilly reenacted on the banks of the Danube. Avram's life gets complicated. He starts having an affair with his own daughter in law, lands in conflict with his ex-immigrant neighbors and his life is literally under threat. The film ends with an unpredictable situation.","popularity":0.4992,"poster_path":"/wweEV8TyzTC5gKlBF0NiajUoTdN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tandem Film","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2009-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Floating Things","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magda Cernat","original_name":"Magda Cernat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Iuliana","credit_id":"5712e16cc3a368537000c0ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toma Cuzin","original_name":"Toma Cuzin","popularity":0.1333,"profile_path":"/yDXfHvylkI4atFU20rb1aGUAzhq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5712e17c9251413367002cbe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudiu Maier","original_name":"Claudiu Maier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Policeman","credit_id":"59ccf322c3a3682a920129c8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olimpia Melinte","original_name":"Olimpia Melinte","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":"/9jHHpvGERnT1scMubMVOHMufT0t.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Magda","credit_id":"59ccf32c925141398c0137dd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1412701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liviu Pintileasa","original_name":"Liviu Pintileasa","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/cdiVCXeSdarii4PVRJW083DI3p3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Romeo","credit_id":"59ccf335c3a3682a920129e1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentin Popescu","original_name":"Valentin Popescu","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/nOja2mOaVSg4CwnPWd61n2qEaUl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Avram","credit_id":"59ccf33e92514139c6013322","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicodim Ungureanu","original_name":"Nicodim Ungureanu","popularity":0.1811,"profile_path":"/t35jTdqQ3uTbCEHPhpAxapsRgnj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"59ccf34992514139bf013a86","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mircea Daneliuc","original_name":"Mircea Daneliuc","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/cDPcL84NxOZMODhzWQw1ShSNeto.jpg","credit_id":"5712e12ac3a368673d004c4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mircea Daneliuc","original_name":"Mircea Daneliuc","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/cDPcL84NxOZMODhzWQw1ShSNeto.jpg","credit_id":"5712e149c3a3686678005a61","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1629706","wikidata_id":"Q29581104","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"ro","file_path":"/wweEV8TyzTC5gKlBF0NiajUoTdN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":702}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":131,"name":"italy"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":155715,"name":"police dog"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
