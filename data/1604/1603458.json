The video embodies a revolutionary character; it is disobedient and determined to challenge and desacralise all those protest actions that have been considered anarchist, both in the past and present. Through its documentary style, Tactical Frivolity + Rhythms of Resistance captures all those “frivolous” practices, all those micro-actions of social struggle that instill fear in those in positions of power. The work documents the protests of the British group Earth First! against the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Prague, in September 2000.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8XadRE6XCfkm6H78UGICktlaZn0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tactical Frivolity + Rhythms of Resistance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2845711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcelo Expósito","original_name":"Marcelo Expósito","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694bc3f646f03006098ec7d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1807226,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nuria Vila","original_name":"Nuria Vila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694bc401128330a241b1d65a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":756,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8XadRE6XCfkm6H78UGICktlaZn0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":504}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
