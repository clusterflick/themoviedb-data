Special attention is given to the medieval churches: \"St. Panteleimon\" in Gorno Nerezi and \"St. George\" in the village of Kurbinovo. Two hundred years before the Renaissance began in Italy, the Renaissance began in Macedonia, with the frescoes of the famous masters Mihail and Evtihij. Comparing the fresco \"Lamentation of Christ\" by Giotto di Bondone, who is considered a harbinger of the Renaissance, and the same fresco by Mihail and Evtihij, one notices a great similarity in the psychological analysis of the characters.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":146678,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lavirint Production","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2018-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Renaissance Embryo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538193,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Goran Naumovski","original_name":"Goran Naumovski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694b12bd1b3349feaf8cef3b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287598,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Milan Jakšikj","original_name":"Milan Jakšikj","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694b141979548cde94812d14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287598,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Milan Jakšikj","original_name":"Milan Jakšikj","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694b142977daef1d782fca28","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5895101,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Irina Lazarova","original_name":"Irina Lazarova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694b144aeb0466f518fb1fc7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petar Džurovski","original_name":"Petar Džurovski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694b145805478850e22fca8f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287598,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Milan Jakšikj","original_name":"Milan Jakšikj","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694b146b6fae3c26ea8ec2ba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
