This film, bringing together exceptional contributors such as Richard Taylor, author Robin Hobb, French writers Maxime Chattam and Estelle Faye, and history-specialist videographer Ben, is narrated by Adeline Chetail. Designed as an immersive journey with spectacular images, it takes viewers into a parallel world, born in response to the crises of history. A world that has become a reflection of very real dreams and struggles, but also a celebration of the imagination, its richness, and its power over lives.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/HyV8YHuudOKafVO5RCjkw1Pfno.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85979,"logo_path":"/A5tJ4wnByy98VlnqmyOmETdez3y.png","name":"TSVP","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il était une fois... le triomphe de la Fantasy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1373246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adeline Chetail","original_name":"Adeline Chetail","popularity":0.4043,"profile_path":"/eC9zx47fnwVu1WaLZqCae101Cyk.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self -
