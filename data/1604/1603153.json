Filming began in the spring of 2000, with the city of Habbaniyah selected as the primary shooting location. The film is considered the first Iraqi feature to address the Second Gulf War and involved Iraqi actors alongside Iraqi military units. Approximately 50 actors and 200 military personnel participated in the production. It is believed that the film’s original title was The Longest Day in History before settling on its final name.  The film was not permitted to be screened, similar to another Iraqi film, The Countdown. It was reportedly banned because it did not meet the approval of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/500GK5CjWhG0XRIFcjBGZEy0fBo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194595,"logo_path":"/meHuYAzAawV34t7YEjtfuGPxZda.png","name":"دائرة السينما
