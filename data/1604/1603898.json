Led by the dean, the Rev Dr Stephen Cherry, the concert begins in the time-honoured way as a solo chorister sings the first verse of Once in Royal David's City.  Music includes Philip Ledger’s setting of On Christmas Night, Anton Bruckner’s Ave Maria and The Lamb by John Tavener. The story of the Nativity is read by members of King’s College in the words of the King James Bible and in Christmas poems by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, UA Fanthorpe and Howard Thurman. Congregational carols include Unto Us Is Born a Son, O Come All Ye Faithful and Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.","popularity":0.1786,"poster_path":"/ohPyx52dviWVfCn19evIQKghFuz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144640,"logo_path":"/dU4Bna2kbK5S6npO7N1Q5rpOwRn.png","name":"BBC Two","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carols from King's: A Celebration of Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5727064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Choir of King's College, Cambridge","original_name":"Choir of King's College, Cambridge","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gMjZBCxFjf5A8TaELvknK0QJjIp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"694d4bea1cdb3f496f072942","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5897684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Hyde","original_name":"Daniel Hyde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"694d4c10dc99416ae17ab631","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5897685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Cherry","original_name":"Stephen Cherry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"694d4c393749b13f648cd9c5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5897686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lise Fanchini","original_name":"Lise Fanchini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"694d4ce01cdb3f496f07295e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5897690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahalia Nesbeth Bain","original_name":"Mahalia Nesbeth Bain","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"694d4e7bb6e9ddb98efb0784","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5897703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleanor Mackey","original_name":"Eleanor Mackey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"694d5239a79d0063cd7ad42d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5897709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petra Brewer","original_name":"Petra Brewer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"694d53bd0fb7e2b5e3b1bf38","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5897713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iris Tadie","original_name":"Iris Tadie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"694d54f80b16c9b9f915495e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5897718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Hayes","original_name":"Sean Hayes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"694d558e219c77e555fb0766","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5897719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zahra Marie Cofie","original_name":"Zahra Marie Cofie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"694d55ed5750eb110e8eafda","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":559789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcus Viner","original_name":"Marcus Viner","popularity":1.5294,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694d4b5bcae9f9a826fb06eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4047498,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jessica Bolton","original_name":"Jessica Bolton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694d4b68568ec8a4921548b0","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3707456,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rosheen Archer","original_name":"Rosheen Archer","popularity":0.0356,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694d4b79c47bd929a38cdaa0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ohPyx52dviWVfCn19evIQKghFuz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
