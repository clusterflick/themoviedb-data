Germany in the late 1800's was the epicenter for craftsmen making Christmas décor and ornaments. One such craftsman was Richard Mahr. Born on St. Nicholas day December 6, 1879, it would seem he was destined to build a life around Christmas and its traditions. Born at the dawn of a new century, a time of upheaval and change. This is the story of Richard Mahr and his family and how they overcame personal tragedies while navigating their company through the Great Depression, two world wars, a devastating fire and the annexation of their homeland by the communist state. How did Richard Mahr and his family survive insurmountable odds to save his vision for KEEPING CHRISTMAS?","popularity":0.1643,"poster_path":"/iEpQwHFD4hLtTf5m89v93gqFcx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":284090,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eventures Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keeping Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Forkel","original_name":"Evelyn Forkel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"694ac0482ee03d54d9155b93","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Van Velsor","original_name":"Rick Van Velsor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694abfc3edfc44b8a97aca45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894478,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Elias Danner","original_name":"Elias Danner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694abfeb51d9a2755a812f57","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/el0XBezrdnrpMeGtJUC8NjwNVBg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/go0gmyRClN8yd48nlJxTPoZNGT0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iEpQwHFD4hLtTf5m89v93gqFcx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207317,"name":"christmas"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
