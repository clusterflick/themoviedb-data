His class teacher, Orhan, assigns a one-page daily journal to improve writing skills. While other children simply write about their daily experiences, Bekir creates a world filled with his dreams of becoming a police officer, writing 15 pages of imaginary adventures in his journal, where he fights for justice and catches criminals. One day, Orhan considers Bekir's creativity a \"bad example\" for other children and calls his family to school. Bekir finds himself caught between the physical violence he experiences at home from his father and the psychological pressure from his teacher at school. In this double struggle, he tries to find the strength within himself to protect his dreams; his fantasy world becomes his refuge, while he confronts the hardships of real life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4xKcs0WIsXwXopbOAtzHjpixb6w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hayaller Özgürlük İster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4490207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"İlker Yağız Selçuk","original_name":"İlker Yağız Selçuk","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/iO0DzqdwpYjmTdeyAg5yt6KoYlc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"694b514251d9a2755a8131ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3329370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sinan Arslan","original_name":"Sinan Arslan","popularity":0.2862,"profile_path":"/jW5lWXwZTpL6ShEXV3XEsxZ8QIe.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"694b51710387d39733b1d789","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1994515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burak Demir","original_name":"Burak Demir","popularity":0.5517,"profile_path":"/jODIvdeQOtuchE9X0wgESXWVkhw.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"694b51b0e5069b831d7ac98b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3619804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sibel Akdeniz","original_name":"Sibel Akdeniz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"694b51c6fd335acbc8b1d693","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5895430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uluç Orhan Durmaçalış","original_name":"Uluç Orhan Durmaçalış","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694b5065af47521cee074808","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5895430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uluç Orhan Durmaçalış","original_name":"Uluç Orhan Durmaçalış","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694b50724ac07071242fcd5b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4177769,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Burak Baybars","original_name":"Burak Baybars","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694b5084c1eaf926bafb1f52","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5895430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uluç Orhan Durmaçalış","original_name":"Uluç Orhan Durmaçalış","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694b508f728568dbaa812c48","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4114586,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Metin Sönmezsoy","original_name":"Metin Sönmezsoy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694b50a8debf5529e78ec599","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2522,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ludwig van Beethoven","original_name":"Ludwig van Beethoven","popularity":0.5069,"profile_path":"/bSyMM4Y7qWLKMvDuynPJ3mn3Pup.jpg","credit_id":"694b50d132b230feb18ec32e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2048,"iso_3166_1":"TR","iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/4xKcs0WIsXwXopbOAtzHjpixb6w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1446}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Izmir International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2025-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"6th Esenler Film Festival","release_date":"2025-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
