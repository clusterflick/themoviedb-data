One of the noteworthy takeaways from these clips is the oddly frequent laughter on the set, especially while shooting some particularly wrenching scenes. Next are a few pieces on the prosthetic effects used for some of the stabbings, etc. It wraps up with Park Chan-Wook discussing the casting process for some of the smaller roles and footage of Park's friend Ryu Seung-Wan helping to choreograph a scene on set.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oebPkgJmm7Du2U1ApoSF4NWfugH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Process of Mr. Vengeance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Chan-wook","original_name":"박찬욱","popularity":3.8519,"profile_path":"/jsSFCVB7MhuVbSLwTgESiXEiNjt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"694b3e167561f486e2812ecb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Song Kang-ho","original_name":"송강호","popularity":3.3192,"profile_path":"/7dw9wIpFZ5nJZ3zqrue8t7hUUgQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"694b3e274e760029912fcc4b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shin Ha-kyun","original_name":"신하균","popularity":0.9419,"profile_path":"/pZ8utGGb0R90HU92JQfGdTN5Cyb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"694b3e31b6f83d7552fb1b26","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bae Doona","original_name":"배두나","popularity":3.0208,"profile_path":"/owMv65TuU4thBBJCpv3uWr1bWfc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"694b3e389aecf23af6812f91","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oebPkgJmm7Du2U1ApoSF4NWfugH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Process of Mr. Vengeance - Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002)","key":"F0OuOIK8Xxw","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-06T03:00:13.000Z","id":"694b3e7a7422142406b1d5fd"}]}}}
