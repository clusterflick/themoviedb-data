We follow the story of a loner, Nathan, who has been pushed around by life, and his only happiness is martial arts films. He built so many walls around his life that he can’t get out of a routine of a low-level cleaner job at a gym and lonely night-time binges on TV. Until he can’t have enough of his horrible life, he joins a human trial to become a better self. Not knowing what he signed up for is more than a friendly trial to help people. To make matters worse, Nathan is now accidentally involved with a criminal organisation, and he has no answer or defences. Until his alter ego - HERO, spawns out. But Hero, just like Nathan, is full of flaws and contradictions. And the two form an unlikely friendship where perhaps at the end, only one can survive. An action film for the new generation full of adrenaline, fights, emotions and martial arts.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/whHYKNzC9L1wDhLfy4ltgHvutyg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":278472,"logo_path":"/suAVlq83EBitw2RNgbw33O9FZoR.png","name":"Aki Studio London","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"from Zero to Hero","title":"My Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4589336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnaldo Stafa","original_name":"Arnaldo Stafa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Nathen","credit_id":"694d6981728568dbaa8132ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5897845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rocky Brower","original_name":"Rocky Brower","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jade","credit_id":"694d6f3cc41d81d196072945","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5302123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charmel Koloko","original_name":"Charmel Koloko","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/2d5b036pmRQUltRFcotK1O8vmut.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Terry","credit_id":"694d6f58dc99416ae17ab6c2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5897847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitchell Lwis","original_name":"Mitchell Lwis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mr Sweeny","credit_id":"694d6f734935b2e332fb2391","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3653348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Magaye","original_name":"Jessica Magaye","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694d6f9adc99416ae17ab6c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5897852,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martyn Rowland","original_name":"Martyn Rowland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694d6fabd7f07c5af51549e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837335,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Enrico Tessarin","original_name":"Enrico Tessarin","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694d6fcda46bee867eb1bfe2","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4076453,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Bretherton","original_name":"John Bretherton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694d6fec4d76ebf5f2154926","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/whHYKNzC9L1wDhLfy4ltgHvutyg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":780,"name":"kung fu"},{"id":9181,"name":"alter ego"},{"id":159315,"name":"mental health"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
