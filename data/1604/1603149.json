It profiles the work of Irreverent Warriors, who organize dozens of Silkies Hikes each year across the United States, where men and women gather wearing only their insanely short military-issue ‘silkies’ boxer briefs. They then hike 22 kilometers with 22 kilograms on their backs to remember and mourn the 22 veterans who kill themselves on average each day. More importantly, the film documents how the Hikers are aiming to do more than ‘raise awareness’ about suicide; it shows how the Hikes' atmosphere of camaraderie, humor, and vulnerability actively prevents veteran suicide.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/y48Ylszswo90BLNmy64hrrQPt60.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silkies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaremey McMullin","original_name":"Jaremey McMullin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694aea7389e2aa8f55073cd5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894782,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tanja Schangin","original_name":"Tanja Schangin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694aeac0a79d0063cd7acb64","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894780,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Matthew Hyndman","original_name":"Matthew Hyndman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694aeba3c4780926b20740fd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894782,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tanja Schangin","original_name":"Tanja Schangin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694aebba416d0f0d388ec5ef","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaremey McMullin","original_name":"Jaremey McMullin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694aebcaea99e4dfdb8ec544","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y48Ylszswo90BLNmy64hrrQPt60.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
