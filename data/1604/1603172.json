As the film recounts, Nelson never intended to end up in a legal battle lawsuit, but as it turned out Good Morning To You Productions vs. Warner Chappell (2015) became a central part to the story. While filming a documentary about the 100-year history of the Happy Birthday song, Nelson found that a large corporation was profiting off a dubious copyright claim, to the tune of some $2 million a year in licensing fees. She was faced with a tough decision: take on a giant corporation that has considerable power in her business or simply pay a fee to use the song and do nothing. Nelson chose to file a class action suit.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gORsiP4Qcv6VwGxlwBwIPriQxow.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saving Happy Birthday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5954904","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gORsiP4Qcv6VwGxlwBwIPriQxow.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
