She and Michael — high school steadies - fell madly in love. Or so they thought. Like Betsy, Michael owned an exemplary reputation. He, too, participated actively with the youth at their church.  But then everything changed, suddenly and cruelly, when Betsy missed school one day to see a doctor. The doctor confirmed her fears. She was pregnant. The soft music silent, the glow of romance dim, Michael and Betsy discovered they really weren't in love at all. That didn't change the fact, however, of a new life they had brought into existence. Should they get married? Should Betsy submit to an abortion? Should she have the baby and offer it for adoption? Should she keep the baby as a single mother?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ke8QOtbn5tEMGNC2d38jQPnmq6A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89185,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ken Anderson Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Betsy knew she had broken God's law.
