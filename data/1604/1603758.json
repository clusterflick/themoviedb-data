For most of his 92 years - from the frontlines of the Spanish Civil War to the picket lines of the U.S. labor movement, from the struggles for civil rights in Mississippi to his work for human rights in Nicaragua - Osheroff threw himself into the fray with rare energy and enthusiasm. In this riveting and inspiring new film, Osheroff reflects on the meaning of his activism, exploring the ideas that animated his actions and sharing wisdom built up over a lifetime of commitment to the \"radical humanism\" that defined his politics and philosophy.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/s4uqza3WNpYIuaANhFDOuIFD74t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27072,"logo_path":"/6kSyzXASYqFyD7HVPg32rTsprjd.png","name":"Media Education Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abe Osheroff: One Foot in the Grave, the Other Still Dancing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3310927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abe Osheroff","original_name":"Abe Osheroff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"694cb646d5979bde41b1bd48","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865130,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadeem Uddin","original_name":"Nadeem Uddin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694cb6726e17f249cc2fb2ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865130,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadeem Uddin","original_name":"Nadeem Uddin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694cb698936ff5a8ccb1bdb9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5897202,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert W.
