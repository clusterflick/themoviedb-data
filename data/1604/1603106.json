As he reflects on his long night of gift-giving, he’s joined by a drowsy elf assistant, a magical fairy, a rapping rudolph and a friendly squirrel who wanders in and out of the scene, adding gentle humor. Santa thanks the viewer for the cookies left out, speaks directly about kindness and good behavior, and closes with a warm, intimate moment of VHS-era Christmas cheer meant to feel like a message made just for you.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/7PHrdQfiFVgKXna05hfAd8y2hm9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A message from Santa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7PHrdQfiFVgKXna05hfAd8y2hm9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
