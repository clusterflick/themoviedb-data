It represents an insight into the motivation and behavior of the offender, tactics used by note passers and armed robbers versus bank personnel or law enforcement officers, and what scenarios are needed to activate the silent alarm or not. Also uses actual black and white surveillance photographs, chosen from those taken during real robberies or taken by news photographers.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Alarm Response","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
