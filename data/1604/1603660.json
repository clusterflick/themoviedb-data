Maeve, Roser, and sisters Perla and Aurora each lost their mother, their father, and their safe home in a single day. Director Sara Kolster, in collaboration with expert Perla Joy, tells their stories about that single day, about how it could happen, but especially about what came afterward. Using tape, they reconstruct the contours of their childhood home, as it was before it became a crime scene, even though it served as a blueprint of their childhood.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/z2c1k9Lwoj5yhvK77XymgPL91Bb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84620,"logo_path":null,"name":"HUMAN","origin_country":""},{"id":51184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Basalt
