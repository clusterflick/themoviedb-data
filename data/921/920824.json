They have rotted, or destroyed accidentally or on purpose. Horror classics like LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT might be gone forever. Many other films are presently in danger of decomposition. LOST EMULSION tells that story, and the story of film restoration. Discover the plight of the lost films like the Edison Frankenstein, the work of Theda Bara, Lon Chaney, Wallace Reid, Joan Blondell, Raoul Walsh and more.
