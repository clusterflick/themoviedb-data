She is in love with Sharad and both want to get married. Lusty Thakur Gajraj Singh, who will shortly become an MLA, takes a liking to Roshni and, together with bandit Bhairav Singh, abduct Roshni in her bridal gear, killing Sharad, and having their way with her. Roshni survives, decides to complain to the Police, not only refuse to take any action, but the Police Inspector in Charge also has his way with her. Humiliated, she is left on the streets, rescued by kind-hearted bandit, Shankara, who recruits her and she swears to avenge her humiliation by killing her molesters. She unleashes a wave of terror attacks, prompting the government to assign Inspector Ramesh Kumar to arrest her at any and all costs.
