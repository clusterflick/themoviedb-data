The visionary author of \"Inferno\", the first book of the \"Divine Comedy\", he was both a direct witness and a narrator of his times and his poem is a remarkable geopolitical chronicle of a tumultuous period of the Middle Ages from 1300 to 1320, a time when Kings, Popes, rulers and warlords played a deadly chess game for the control of Europe. In this high end docudrama, some of the world's finest scholars will help provide historical context to the unfolding of events, making them accessible to a wide audience, and giving us a privileged viewpoint over one of the most eventful and funding chapters of European history.","popularity":0.7293,"poster_path":"/dgMHTegPnn22lsvwuxGNOh3hSyt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168008,"logo_path":"/7FcWRLuIiw3iD6mCOmjUIznp4V0.png","name":"Rai
