His cigarettes are dwindling strangely fast. He wonders if he's smoking enough for two people. Or is there someone else smoking? Then he thinks. Is there really no one in the room when I'm not there? Then one day, a man in a pair of briefs appears from the wardrobe. The man, who sometimes tries to fly on the balcony, begins to ask practical questions and give his opinion to Sato, who spends her days in a state of apathy. What is his true identity...?  The world stretches out beyond his sight. When he thinks about the overwhelming size of the world, he realises how small he is. Cutting off all contact with the outside world, Sato tries to hide his fear. By using subtitles for his conversations with the man, the film succeeds in expressing his closed world. The humorous touch of the film, depicting a small rebirth that took place over a few days, was made even more striking by the ending theme music.","popularity":0.1009,"poster_path":"/dZL9IdxyJZcm0DO9bruTkg7EqUp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"COCKROACH MAN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360720,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nagaike Hiroshi","original_name":"Nagaike Hiroshi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"61ca4d61ce9e91008661fd2a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yosuke Ohno","original_name":"Yosuke Ohno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"61ca4d6d33ad8f0099331afb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fukutsu Yasushi","original_name":"Fukutsu Yasushi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"61ca4d7737b3a9008fc859c5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1104912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masanori Tominaga","original_name":"冨永昌敬","popularity":0.0796,"profile_path":"/sr1tKr39s77RuZKPi9BWWcJMtB4.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"61ca4d81a284eb004236f313","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fukutsu Yasushi","original_name":"Fukutsu Yasushi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca4ceb6743fa0042522f77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fukutsu Yasushi","original_name":"Fukutsu Yasushi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca4cf2c7c224006255f43c","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fukutsu Yasushi","original_name":"Fukutsu Yasushi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca4cf78813e4001ce0d307","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360720,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nagaike Hiroshi","original_name":"Nagaike Hiroshi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca4d15b6c2640042d2aa82","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360721,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ito Nobuhiro","original_name":"Ito Nobuhiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca4d20b04228001c824757","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360722,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Furusawa Shuji","original_name":"Furusawa Shuji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca4d2ae72fe80061179fa2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360720,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nagaike Hiroshi","original_name":"Nagaike Hiroshi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca4d3637b3a9004db1529a","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360725,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Suzuki Ryuichiro","original_name":"Suzuki Ryuichiro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca4d42ecaef5008eba1516","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360726,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kumada Yuko","original_name":"Kumada Yuko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca4d4ccdbaff0042736d00","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2067954,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Minami Nozaki","original_name":"Minami Nozaki","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca4d5681a7fc0091715a99","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dZL9IdxyJZcm0DO9bruTkg7EqUp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
