On the night she breaks up with her lover, she gives herself up to Sakurai, who adores her. Sakurai tells her that he will take Mikage's place as her child, but the next day he turns into a real boy. Mikage is surprised, but she begins to love him like a mother and a sister. At the same time, a news report about the unsettling world situation comes on the radio... The film is a realistic portrayal of a fantasy, with a tightly constructed structure and assured direction that adheres to theory. The ending, which seems to foretell of Japan in the near future, is a heartbreaking coincidence with the title of the film.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1wP836Ep63w88dW7DFlA3Vu4RzK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BORN TO BE BABE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sasaki Akiko","original_name":"Sasaki Akiko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61ca59d9a284eb0042371328","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360854,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kurahara Tadanori","original_name":"Kurahara Tadanori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca59ccecaef5008eba3449","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360853,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Uno Ryotaro","original_name":"Uno Ryotaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca59c06818880063bd01b7","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360852,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kiyatake Yasushi","original_name":"Kiyatake Yasushi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca59b537b3a9001d820483","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360851,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Baba Tadashi","original_name":"Baba Tadashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca59a933ad8f0099333e78","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideshima Yasuo","original_name":"Hideshima Yasuo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca59406f53e1001da6f17b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1wP836Ep63w88dW7DFlA3Vu4RzK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
