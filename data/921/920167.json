After moving into the mansion, Aoko Aozaki begins to learn sorcery from a young mage, Alice Kuonji, the rumored witch of the mansion. The Aozaki family oversees the land on which Misaki is built and the heir (Aoko) is tasked with protecting it. Mysterious intruders have been disrupting the bounded field in Misaki, leading Alice and Aoko to investigate. A mannequin or puppet attacks them and is incinerated. As this happens, both of them spot someone running away, a civilian who must not get away having seen magic alive. Unexpectedly, a young boy named Soujuurou Shizuki is drawn to the mansion and comes to reside with them as well.","popularity":0.5161,"poster_path":"/lYkNSIzHTaHP7s8nL54N2sNYqLH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5887,"logo_path":"/m6FEqz8rQECnmfjEwjNhNAlmhCJ.png","name":"ufotable","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":53787,"logo_path":"/wZ0g1QrGz19fXA2fRzGfqGeMvrC.png","name":"TYPE-MOON","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":2883,"logo_path":"/rDYExnBV61jGQnkhVVrPN4Yl7O1.png","name":"Aniplex","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Witch on the Holy Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Mahōtsukai no Yoru","type":"romaji"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Mahoutsukai no Yoru","type":"romaji"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Mahoyo","type":"abbreviation"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224339,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kinoko Nasu","original_name":"奈須きのこ","popularity":0.4088,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676b79d89d07c335fe7ecec3","department":"Crew","job":"Video Game"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224339,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kinoko Nasu","original_name":"奈須きのこ","popularity":0.4088,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677e9779f2c621807dbb1c26","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31970593","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"mahoyo_movie"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eTs5EnaQtnMDfwawMFDoVZLs7Fp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x7OezdC1pLG64xWKNhjIDXY0GcQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/qodJEEQlqIxELUqrSPk3U0Uid7a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/xvj9DP5IGE333hXm3ovWm4nYoCI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.48,"height":200,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/dB3aLebYhosLHTtx648z16SzzCq.png","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":696},{"aspect_ratio":3.48,"height":200,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/tJGS9TQWMZEhVPq5kgt9tQtO6Rg.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":696}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1053,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lYkNSIzHTaHP7s8nL54N2sNYqLH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":702}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":616,"name":"witch"},{"id":2343,"name":"magic"},{"id":210024,"name":"anime"},{"id":222216,"name":"based on visual novel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
