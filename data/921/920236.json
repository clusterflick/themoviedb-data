Today, Gagauzians have nothing other than their bonds to each other.  The Fountain is about the ceasing culture and language of the Gagauz people. It portrays the effects of the rise and fall of the Soviet Union on different generations while displaying the consequences of the vast social assimilation by following the daily lives of local families. The tradition of the Gagauz community is unique and preserved almost intact for centuries. However, it is rapidly fading now, as the elderly pass away. Unfortunately, the fountain flows weaker and weaker through the new generations.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/7YJqunS9iKW8EOEPP6q4KSg4vQe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2021-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What happens to ordinary people when an empire falls down?","title":"The Fountain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrei Daradur","original_name":"Andrei Daradur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61c8df6f511d09008e1d9ae4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Daradur","original_name":"Maria Daradur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61c8df788813e40054bf43e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanya Daradur","original_name":"Tanya Daradur","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61c8df93b6c2640042d00733","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Boev","original_name":"Sergey Boev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61c8df7fa93d2500414357e6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Daradur","original_name":"Marina Daradur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61c8df85511d090043d5e4fb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandr Daradur","original_name":"Alexandr Daradur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61c8dface72fe80061150e41","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Petiş","original_name":"Sofia Petiş","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"61c8e2b9ca83540041467225","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fedora Petiş","original_name":"Fedora Petiş","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"61c8e2bfa055ef004403b1c3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgiy Petiş","original_name":"Georgiy Petiş","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"61c8e2c9ecaef5001c3c2ef7","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fedora Petiş","original_name":"Fedora Petiş","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"61c8e2cfa93d250061b198df","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3027421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"İlayda İşeri","original_name":"İlayda İşeri","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c8dfc28813e400b384547b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1616,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i5nkrmMcybeIyLydly3G2kimUnQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2872},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1645,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2qNDWsUfo553cQWaoz9SSd2Na44.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2925}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7YJqunS9iKW8EOEPP6q4KSg4vQe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"Directed by Women Turkey Youth View 1st Prize","release_date":"2021-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"6th Kısadan Hisse Short Film Competition 2nd Place","release_date":"2021-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"International Usak Short Film Festival Best Student Documentary","release_date":"2021-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
