Now Guy's life is destroyed too, because he is put on trial for this bloody act. There will be a convictionmanslaughter for ten years behind bars. This punishment is connected with a deportation. For seven years, Walser spent the life of a Bagno convict in nowhere, he was an outcast.","popularity":0.2285,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":91432,"logo_path":null,"name":"Continental-Kunstfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1913-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ein Ausgestoßener: 1.
