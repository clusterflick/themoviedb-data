Kyoko Yamada is an ugly woman. She has a man in her life, Momotani, whom she has feelings for. He says to her, \"Bring your friends and come visit me. Yamada, who is ugly and has no friends, goes out on the street and talks to girls. There is only one criterion. The only criteria is that the girl has to look good enough to complement him. Finally, Yamada finds a fat girl and takes her to Momotani's flat. But Momotani is a fat lover.  The protagonist, who relies on fortune-telling in order to become beautiful and is bossy with the same sex whom she identifies as less than her, confronts the audience with \"the ugly part of you\", in the form of a laugh, saying \"ugly people are such creatures\". The film is a radical stomping ground of the looks complex.","popularity":0.0437,"poster_path":"/CoQ9VkMzM56C9zp1mdXi2omLv2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"超愛人","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace","original_name":"Grace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"61c8ae86549dda009c596a1e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sato Ayako","original_name":"Sato Ayako","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"61c8ae92b042280090297360","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toda Shizuyo","original_name":"Toda Shizuyo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"61c8ae9b0102c90041055110","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359288,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Murobushi Atsuko","original_name":"Murobushi Atsuko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c8ae3cf5f1c5008f4d517a","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359310,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Suga Josuke","original_name":"Suga Josuke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c8ae48be2d490061421ff9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359308,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Takano Ma","original_name":"Takano Ma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c8ae1b549dda00416e4a1e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keiko Utagawa","original_name":"Keiko Utagawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c8adee07291c005f212e08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359307,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Shibuya Tokuko","original_name":"Shibuya Tokuko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c8ae02b6c26400610a09a7","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359309,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Suto Ayumi","original_name":"Suto Ayumi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c8ae27a93d25004142f2f8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359314,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kobayashi Junya","original_name":"Kobayashi Junya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c8ae70a93d25001c291bc4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359288,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Murobushi Atsuko","original_name":"Murobushi Atsuko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c8ae35be2d49001cc0e989","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359311,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aoki Hidemi","original_name":"Aoki Hidemi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c8ae53a93d25001c291b38","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/CoQ9VkMzM56C9zp1mdXi2omLv2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2dRRKbTmfcovC3G3aeMhLUiyFNy.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
