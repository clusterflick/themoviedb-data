As in the second part, the action consists of fictional events (the first part was about real events). Błażejewski is caught in a round-up. Leopold Wójcik's papers were found with him. The pointer lets Wójcik know about this event and warns his colleagues from Kielce who manage to escape. During the interrogation, Błażejewski denies the papers that were found with him. Soon he is released. This does not mean the end of problems for people dealing with Wójcik's case.","popularity":0.0792,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urodzony po raz trzeci","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1245088,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tadeusz Lampka","original_name":"Tadeusz Lampka","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a082e4447f9c01315a340a","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0171868","wikidata_id":"Q27997008","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1992-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
