The only \"vertical road movie\" in the world.  Kimama-chan is a liar, selfish and extremely pushy. She is a liar, selfish and extremely pushy, so much so that even one of her few friends plans a trip with another girl. When Kimama finds out about this, instead of feeling sorry for herself, she prepares a long ladder and starts to observe and disturb her rivals in order to outwit them. But it's all for naught and she sets off on a journey up the remaining ladder. After meeting and parting with a mysterious man, the journey turns into a journey to find something. Will Kimama-chan be able to find \"something\"? Will she be able to come back to earth after the climb?  I wanted to make a vertical road movie\", says the director.
