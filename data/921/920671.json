This time his \"victims\" are well-known citizens of Kraków: Stanisław Lem, one of the most brilliant, versatile, and unapologetically cerebral science fiction writers, author of 'Solaris'; Krzysztof Penderecki, one of the most esteemed and widely discussed Polish composers of the 20th century; and Wisława Szymborska, Nobel laureate in Literature in 1996, one of the few women poets who has received the Swedish prize. Gierłatowski assumes the role of a modern Stańczyk, a legendary thinker-jester, prophesying on the historical Polish Republic in his dramatic conviction that History annihilated the intellectual elite of his nation and the future will bring awe and destruction.","popularity":0.1056,"poster_path":"/w3vMmacaLpC7FfqdAn4tKb7gqb7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2003-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A portrait of a portraitist.","title":"Poles Poles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3361114,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Krzysztof Gierałtowski","original_name":"Krzysztof Gierałtowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61cab31eb0422800613f657c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8453,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stanisław Lem","original_name":"Stanisław Lem","popularity":0.2362,"profile_path":"/uPhE30C0GETl8lX2ncRGFad3ab4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61cab33c90cf510042724dc9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55975,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Krzysztof Penderecki","original_name":"Krzysztof Penderecki","popularity":0.1157,"profile_path":"/7cAbfLFn5pYQFLAdHzcb64dPqQa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61cab34c647654008fd7c395","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3361115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wisława Szymborska","original_name":"Wisława Szymborska","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61cab3776743fa0064d86860","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Borys Lankosz","original_name":"Borys Lankosz","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/51kqHIFsF9jkQBdutDQH1t9VnNZ.jpg","credit_id":"61cab2c9549dda0041726877","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcin Koszałka","original_name":"Marcin Koszałka","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cab3d1511d09008e2113b1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3361116,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Biel","original_name":"Barbara Biel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cab3bda284eb00628ba931","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3361114,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Krzysztof Gierałtowski","original_name":"Krzysztof Gierałtowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cab30cecaef50042aacc47","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Borys Lankosz","original_name":"Borys Lankosz","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/51kqHIFsF9jkQBdutDQH1t9VnNZ.jpg","credit_id":"61cab2da81a7fc00190b199d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3361117,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stanisław Bukowski","original_name":"Stanisław Bukowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cab43781a7fc00402e85a3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0420078","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/w3vMmacaLpC7FfqdAn4tKb7gqb7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"43rd Kraków Film Festival","release_date":"2003-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
