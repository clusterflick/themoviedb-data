George, 92, still runs his \"den of anarchists disguised as a bookstore,\" offering free, dirty beds to poor literati, cutting his hair with a candle and gluing the carpet with pancake batter. More than 40,000 poets, travelers and political activists have stayed at Shakespeare and Company, writing or stealing books, throwing parties and making soup or love while living with George's generosity and fits of anger. Illustrious guests include Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, Jacques Prévert, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, James Baldwin and Richard Wright. Welcome to the makeshift utopia of the last member of the Beat Generation.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7UZCYCZiqseJShNV44jsqXpnBSE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait of a Bookstore as an Old Man","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095794,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gonzague Pichelin","original_name":"Gonzague Pichelin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602d9edea6ddcb00405a11b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095794,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gonzague Pichelin","original_name":"Gonzague Pichelin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602d9ee955c1f4003c0458b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2981900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Sutherland","original_name":"Benjamin Sutherland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602d9ebb223e20003f97a34b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2981900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Sutherland","original_name":"Benjamin Sutherland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602d9ef6a6ddcb00415a4d2e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0476588","wikidata_id":"Q7232317","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fOYvoDNX4WGrs75AraaSib4V6bg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1477,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7UZCYCZiqseJShNV44jsqXpnBSE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"(Exact date unknown)","release_date":"2003-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Clip from the Sundance Channel documentary Portrait of a Bookstore as an Old Man: The Temple Priest","key":"fk5xNr32bIA","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2009-09-01T07:35:20.000Z","id":"60f99e70df857c0075c60ee5"}]}}}
