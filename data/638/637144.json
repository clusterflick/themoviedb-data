They live in different parts of Europe: Western Europe -Catalonia (Spain); Eastern Europe -Lithuania; and in the new Europe -Georgia (Akhazia). They have experienced, in different parts of the 20Th century, civil wars and dictatorships. They share the same fate: they stayed where they were born. This film is about people who decide to do nothing in times of war, oppression and occupation. They choose a life amidst the ruins of their past. Even when this choice leads to loneliness: living a dream, not a reality. Alone, between the graves of their loved ones, they spend their last days. They have frozen their lives by protecting themselves from the outside world.","popularity":0.0669,"poster_path":"/hPJkmY8MnbnC6JChEz6siks8xHr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49794,"logo_path":"/bFqE3eQjWlVjValkuzoBHIY3uV2.png","name":"Zeppers","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2012-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweet Smoke of the Fatherland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Slodka bieda w ojczyznie","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Zoete rook van het vaderland","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masha Novikova","original_name":"Masha Novikova","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d99988255c1f4002bc5d0fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223317,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vladas Naudžius","original_name":"Vladas Naudžius","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d99989e55c1f40011c5b51f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362076,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Minks","original_name":"Patrick Minks","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9998cd8c40f700117ab5af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank van den Engel","original_name":"Frank van den Engel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d99989755c1f4002bc5d104","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928152,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Willemijn Cerutti","original_name":"Willemijn Cerutti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d99988f30f79c00114b306d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masha Novikova","original_name":"Masha Novikova","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d99988755c1f40023c5df07","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":54258,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rik Meier","original_name":"Rik Meier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9998e730f79c00114b30d2","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073893,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Bijnen","original_name":"Tom Bijnen","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9998df8c40f700217aa626","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2342702","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/hPJkmY8MnbnC6JChEz6siks8xHr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Planete+ Doc Film Festival","release_date":"2012-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
