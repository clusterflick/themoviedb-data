The lives of the actors and their characters intertwine as Prince Hamlet confronts the ghost of his father and seeks revenge on the treacherous Claudius, his uncle and newly appointed king. Hamlet's pursuit of vengeance scorches the lives of everyone inside the castle walls and lays bare the many contradictions and ambiguities of human existence. At the play's end, seven days have passed and the actors emerge, leaving the castle and characters behind.","popularity":0.2165,"poster_path":"/pUyaG2hbufGv9DxHzMxA4gmX6UV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hamlet in the Golden Vale","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Dwyer","original_name":"Pat Dwyer","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Claudius / The Ghost / Player King","credit_id":"5f7f9253d861af0038830caa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beth Ann Hopkins","original_name":"Beth Ann Hopkins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Gertrude / Player Queen","credit_id":"5f7f925b2f3b170034f3d9c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Hopkins","original_name":"Jonathan Hopkins","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Polonius / Francisco / Gravedigger / Player","credit_id":"5f7f9264c8113d0037a83673","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2699214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elise Kibler","original_name":"Elise Kibler","popularity":0.2667,"profile_path":"/jCw7ypHsKjmaGhpWR6kZqf501n4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ophelia / Osric","credit_id":"5f7f926c021cee00364b9ea0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1754194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Constantine Malahias","original_name":"Constantine Malahias","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rosencrantz / Guildenstern / Marcellus / Gravedigger / Player","credit_id":"5f7f9274d11e0e0036bf1816","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1597303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Vaughn Merchant","original_name":"Anthony Vaughn Merchant","popularity":0.1032,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Horatio","credit_id":"5f7f927d2667780039b40932","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Myers","original_name":"Taylor Myers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Hamlet","credit_id":"5f7f9285b7abb500366c79b3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuriy Pavlish","original_name":"Yuriy Pavlish","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Laertes / Bernardo","credit_id":"5f7f928dd861af00377df8e2","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Shakespeare","original_name":"William Shakespeare","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/60ZqefTZIgfGtklgihIjXmi4ClH.jpg","credit_id":"64c38a851d1bf400e56972f8","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Hasse","original_name":"Dan Hasse","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7f92effdfc9f0038bfaccf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Hasse","original_name":"Dan Hasse","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7f9335c8113d0037a837a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808569,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Taylor Myers","original_name":"Taylor Myers","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7f934c62e86f0037dd6034","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7251048","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pUyaG2hbufGv9DxHzMxA4gmX6UV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
