The village lives and breathes in unison. The Chechen gravediggers are always busy. Death is an everyday visitor. It does not even matter that yet another war has ended. The people live stuck in a circle of vengeance. They also gather into circles to chant prayers to God. Only the cows are grazing calmly next to the cemetery and the children are happily going about their business. The Chechens' parting words to one another are, \"May you come back free!\"","popularity":0.0673,"poster_path":"/iYHcZdTYn7MlvaTWiSy85PT5fXh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103826,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vesilind","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2016-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Chechen","iso_639_1":"ce","name":""},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Come Back Free","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Prikhodi svobodnym","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2390633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ksenia Okhapkina","original_name":"Ksenia Okhapkina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/egPI9f1C278syw3ALCx7A1tk3sX.jpg","credit_id":"5d9a53df81a7fc0018c57d5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125494,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maksim Drozdov","original_name":"Maksim Drozdov","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9a544890cf51001d5a1bb1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2146704,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Riho Västrik","original_name":"Riho Västrik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/pp7Kqe4r9DIOkSBnupkFHdwI06O.jpg","credit_id":"5d9a53ff81a7fc0020c57c8f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2390633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ksenia Okhapkina","original_name":"Ksenia Okhapkina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/egPI9f1C278syw3ALCx7A1tk3sX.jpg","credit_id":"5d9a547081a7fc0018c57dde","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426795,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mirjam Jegorov","original_name":"Mirjam Jegorov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/eyQN61JDaSICksrhjy8jsT2Q9Vi.jpg","credit_id":"5d9a547b81a7fc0020c57d3d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426794,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vitaly Afanasiev","original_name":"Vitaly Afanasiev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9a5414bb2602001312071a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2390633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ksenia Okhapkina","original_name":"Ksenia Okhapkina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/egPI9f1C278syw3ALCx7A1tk3sX.jpg","credit_id":"5d9a53e304b59600213e7b7c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6471638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iYHcZdTYn7MlvaTWiSy85PT5fXh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CinéDOC-Tbilisi","release_date":"2017-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dhaka International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Iran International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2017-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Religion Today FF","release_date":"2017-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Documentary Filmfestival Amsterdam (IDFA)","release_date":"2016-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Camerimage","release_date":"2017-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2016-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
