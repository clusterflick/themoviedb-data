Two Irish drug dealers, Jacko and his much-maligned sidekick Niallser, drag a captured cockney rival into an abandoned shed in the depths of rural Ireland. A stash of cocaine has gone missing, supplies are running low, and Jacko has his mind set on who is responsible. Things don't look good for Andy, the prisoner from London. Especially since the vengeful Jacko has a mighty bone to pick with the English. One that goes all the way back to the Famine. The interrogation spirals into a fiercely nationalistic debate about Anglo-Irish history, increasing the threat that something truly terrible is going to happen. Set in an isolated shed, our three characters play out this absurd scene in real time. The result is a short film full of playful humour and hard-hitting historical facts.","popularity":0.1947,"poster_path":"/idewfh0kyC0N04AhuRD3qSuVGVN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2018-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cocaine Famine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1694735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Martin","original_name":"Brian Martin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ej5IRTqihxazeQI00h1OPK7ssV7.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Jacko","credit_id":"67f81b3ad81748ccff996f33","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1890735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manus Halligan","original_name":"Manus Halligan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Niallser","credit_id":"5d9c3a08439be10033792ff7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Speers","original_name":"Glenn Speers","popularity":0.1591,"profile_path":"/h8xEZGIBN9OJaDlNXNyt45HKkAR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Andy","credit_id":"5d9c3a156b5fc2001ed84ced","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1710688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam McMullen","original_name":"Sam McMullen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9c3a25d388ae0011141b8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545315,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Jenkins","original_name":"Tom Jenkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4f14779a3c4900163838e4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646746,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hamish Anderson","original_name":"Hamish Anderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4f1441283ed900195f5f19","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545313,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joseph Comar","original_name":"Joseph Comar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4f1455283ed900195f5f38","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545314,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lili Lea Abraham","original_name":"Lili Lea Abraham","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4f1461a93d25001744fb9c","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1710688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam McMullen","original_name":"Sam McMullen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4f14c8a76ac500139ee57c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1694735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Martin","original_name":"Brian Martin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ej5IRTqihxazeQI00h1OPK7ssV7.jpg","credit_id":"67f81b5d31775276d6d9b3d4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1694735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Martin","original_name":"Brian Martin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ej5IRTqihxazeQI00h1OPK7ssV7.jpg","credit_id":"67f81b7131775276d6d9b3d8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9288924","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"cocaine_famine"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f5EkeucgZ0b0FQVAquAd8M6IEdR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/idewfh0kyC0N04AhuRD3qSuVGVN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cork International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
