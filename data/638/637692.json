The occasion is perfect to describe the atmosphere of the '70s, the fever in which militants and publicists lived, the clash between art and politics. Includes fragments of the films The Players vs. Ángeles Caídos (Fischerman, 1969), Shadows (John Cassavetes, 1959), Made in U.S.A. (Jean-Luc Godard, 1966), L'eclisse (Michelangelo Antonioni, 1962), The Hour of the Furnaces (Pino Solanas & Octavio Getino, 1968), Tire dié (Fernando Birri, 1960), Alianza para el progreso (Ludueña, 1971), La civilización está haciendo masa y no deja oír (Ludueña, 1974) and La pieza de Franz (Fischerman, 1974).","popularity":0.1778,"poster_path":"/scsffOZRsbgzS4CsrV3mpVi9qCA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2003-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La
