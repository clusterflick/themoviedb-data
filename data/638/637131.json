A group of retreating Soviet soldiers, crossing a lunar terrain in a desperate attempt to escape death, is attacked by a German fighter plane that appears like a bolt from the blue. One by one they are killed. Then suddenly, in an unlikely denouement bordering on the mystical, the attacker is shot down with a simple rifle. For ideological reasons that defy understanding this film, one of Viktor Hres’ earliest works, was shelved in 1967 by Soviet censors. In 2010, it was restored by the Debut Studio of the Oleksander Dovzhenko Film Studio with the support of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Ukraine.","popularity":0.2938,"poster_path":"/uUK85eXY47zNkRXSPFN42V8Cp9O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4581,"logo_path":"/p858ADU9O67a7ageVEjsk18jqak.png","name":"Dovzhenko Film
