Once in the lab, scientists scoop out the alien brains and chuck them into a harvester which extracts and records the final memory so it can be viewed at a later date. The end result: a Cerebral Print. A group of government agents try their damnedest to keep the program a secret while the little grey bastards attempt to probe their way to freedom. This is a compilation of Cerebral Print Files.","popularity":0.9745,"poster_path":"/2pWdTESiqdQk1cty4BBeM2UI4Rk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cerebral Print: The Secret Files","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jed Rowen","original_name":"Jed Rowen","popularity":0.1432,"profile_path":"/gQbls0bZuOqT9DskZhleqHlkx9s.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pvt.
