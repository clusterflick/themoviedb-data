The program takes a fanciful journey as to whether the treasure existed and what might have been its source. It also seeks to connect Sauniere with the mythological \"secret society\" known as the Priory of Sion. The 1982 book Holy Blood, Holy Grail and Dan Brown's 2003 novel The Da Vinci code are both inspired by the Rennes-le-Chateau myth.","popularity":0.0456,"poster_path":"/sQxWbzoSVx3aXIFSvkikMsWUjew.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Priest, the Painter and the Devil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99579,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henry Lincoln","original_name":"Henry Lincoln","popularity":0.1322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679d42d7a74d8ee23b261057","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99579,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henry Lincoln","original_name":"Henry Lincoln","popularity":0.1322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679d42e4ac5a7951b9cb2c90","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sQxWbzoSVx3aXIFSvkikMsWUjew.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1179}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1974-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
