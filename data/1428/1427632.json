Sadiel is unhappy with communist Cuba and these frustrations lead him to embrace right-wing ideas, while Matthias stays true to his beliefs. Their relationship mirrors bigger political issues, challenging their political views and ideas of a “successful” queer relationship. Matthias Lintner films this intimate portrayal, through which both embark on a transformative journey, realizing the true nature of change.","popularity":0.0487,"poster_path":"/dKKSkLjXBA1JOPpnTnyyp8OHDi0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Boyfriend the Fascist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5219070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sadiel Gonzalez","original_name":"Sadiel Gonzalez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"679eb84502a74dc73f953a9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2405762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias Lintner","original_name":"Matthias Lintner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"679eb84cebb9962403264350","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2405762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias Lintner","original_name":"Matthias Lintner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679eb85d04cb6f41b9cb5880","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5219070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sadiel Gonzalez","original_name":"Sadiel Gonzalez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679eb86980082986c8cb5880","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2405762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias Lintner","original_name":"Matthias Lintner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679eb87380082986c8cb5886","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1896010,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Rattini","original_name":"Martin Rattini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679eb8aaebb996240326436b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2405762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias Lintner","original_name":"Matthias Lintner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679eb8b602a74dc73f953af4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5219074,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daria Akimenko","original_name":"Daria Akimenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679eb8c104cb6f41b9cb58de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":971,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gN6AxjjxiJxdJH6slhGsDK1XyxE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1726},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tEvLm7nupeSeHyWdU8KIBfL9Trd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r3GrZ9ZZCpGp5tyMA5Fvl013BaM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dKKSkLjXBA1JOPpnTnyyp8OHDi0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1819},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s5bvxhseQd6mk8d7gHTb095BcIe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pordenone Docs Fest ","release_date":"2025-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
