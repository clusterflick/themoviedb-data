As their exchange unfolds, he smiles, he reminisces, and he listens intentlyâ€”until a single wide shot reveals the haunting truth: he is alone.  Whispers of Wind is a psychological drama that explores love, loss, and the power of memory. Shot in monochrome to enhance its emotional depth, the film captures the delicate balance between reality and illusion, leaving the audience with a lingering sense of melancholy and reflection.","popularity":0.187,"poster_path":"/gRsYSXpba5F6nfz97YVpeS7UyHn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2025-01-28","revenue":100,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Sometimes, love lingers in the whispers of the wind.\"","title":"Whispers of Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5220022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E Mahizhnan","original_name":"E Mahizhnan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Arjun","credit_id":"679f77707ebb0614ff264e7e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5220026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chaitanya juttiga","original_name":"Chaitanya juttiga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Priya","credit_id":"679f779204cb6f41b9cb650a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5220031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A Abdulkani","original_name":"A Abdulkani","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/g7OjCNhodojNDqzVZgiRZRHV1GI.jpg","credit_id":"679f77e5ebb9962403265ed6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5220031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A Abdulkani","original_name":"A Abdulkani","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/g7OjCNhodojNDqzVZgiRZRHV1GI.jpg","credit_id":"679f7cf01742b44a14cb6699","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5220031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A Abdulkani","original_name":"A Abdulkani","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/g7OjCNhodojNDqzVZgiRZRHV1GI.jpg","credit_id":"679f7d0750f5d47625260feb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5220031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A Abdulkani","original_name":"A Abdulkani","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/g7OjCNhodojNDqzVZgiRZRHV1GI.jpg","credit_id":"679f7d1f50f5d47625260ffb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gS91cgMMee3GgfxghX78kT1xLj7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gRsYSXpba5F6nfz97YVpeS7UyHn.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":281237,"name":"independent film"},{"id":309029,"name":"psychological drama"},{"id":346201,"name":"artistic cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
