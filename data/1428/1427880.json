I was 29 years old and had never been in a hospital before. The fear, the chemotherapy, the waiting.  After six months, everything seemed to be getting better, and a year and a half later, my first daughter, Nora, was born. So, three years later, I decided to return to the ward where everything had begun, to try to make sense of what had happened to me. Inside those rooms, I met Sabrina, who was going through what I had experienced.  \"Leucemia\" is the story of our meeting, our journey together, and our shared experiences. It is the story of our friendship and our leukemia.
