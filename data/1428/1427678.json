The voices in your head are right, and everything you know about Wonderland is wrong!  AliSin is a music-driven experience that takes you on an immersive adventure to all the music, madness and mayhem of Wonderland… only this isn’t the Wonderland you know. At least not yet.  AliSin is a twisted new take on Alice in Wonderland – it’s like a Backstage Pass to a bizarro version of the Taylor Swift Eras Tour, inspired by Edward Scissorhands… that had a baby with Rocky Horror, Princess Bride, and Spinal Tap.  AliSin sends you tumbling down the rabbit hole with an exhilarating mix of music, film and animation, served up with a pinch of mischief, a healthy dose of anarchy and a whole lot of attitude.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xdWw54k0NnTUnuFNEmCbbFWcrK5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alisin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xdWw54k0NnTUnuFNEmCbbFWcrK5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1334}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
