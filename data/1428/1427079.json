He will be helped by Alejandra, a young documentary filmmaker who urges him to contextualise the past with the current rise of the far right. By investigating the Atocha attack, David will recover a part of that recent past and at the same time will witness a reality that encourages reflection on some burning issues such as the advance of the far right, problems of access to housing and job insecurity.","popularity":0.3975,"poster_path":"/dT2GYlEG7ywMcYyP4snKlZc3ANY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142833,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dexiderius Producciones Audiovisuales S.L.","origin_country":""},{"id":981,"logo_path":"/pkrdO9ykplO4Zc8edikoSX5APUN.png","name":"TVE","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2025-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seven days in May","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Riondino","original_name":"David Riondino","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/4o7eOOsh102PyM7ESSsIT1XKwnI.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679d59a9b06437a4ee261617","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Díaz","original_name":"Carmen Díaz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679d59b5a74d8ee23b2613a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5216998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José M.
