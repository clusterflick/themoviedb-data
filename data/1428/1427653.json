Inspired by real heartbreak, this Manchester-made feature follows Benji, who meets the elusive and dominant Jake at an airport check-out gate. What begins as thrilling monthly getaways to Amsterdam soon unravels into a doomed power dynamic. Struggling to move on after being dumped, Benji spirals into addiction and fleeting hook-ups, haunted by the love he lost. Created by a collective of working-class LGBT+ filmmakers, Departures is a darkly comic, emotionally charged journeyâ€”think Shirley Valentine meets LGBTQ Trainspotting.","popularity":0.8845,"poster_path":"/f7tWiwedxyIMg69D41deC8SxmxG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They say the best way to move forward is to go back...","title":"Departures","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lloyd Eyre-Morgan","original_name":"Lloyd Eyre-Morgan","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/1AqrwWESHz44u1869O6SrKjawje.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"679ec6dd7b4153a3b99564cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4136886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Tag","original_name":"David Tag","popularity":0.3763,"profile_path":"/jJXH888BxthovMpxMj0FogQvSW9.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"679ec6e8e99df23a9f26391f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liam Boyle","original_name":"Liam Boyle","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"679ec6f3e99df23a9f263926","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3865639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyler Conti","original_name":"Tyler Conti","popularity":0.3151,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"679ec6fcf0f9dbdba6955a86","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1546864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kerry Howard","original_name":"Kerry Howard","popularity":0.2175,"profile_path":"/xF2Pru9y0q3UVlTW9QezySG7vRR.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"679ec70a176fdb2244cb6072","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorraine Stanley","original_name":"Lorraine Stanley","popularity":0.1801,"profile_path":"/j7k3jTWIrRUvTfObm7iSCab1vNo.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"679ec7127b4153a3b99564eb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3777422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob Partali","original_name":"Jacob Partali","popularity":0.0421,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"679ec719f0f9dbdba6955a8e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lloyd Eyre-Morgan","original_name":"Lloyd Eyre-Morgan","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/1AqrwWESHz44u1869O6SrKjawje.jpg","credit_id":"679ec67aa57909701acb522f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Ely","original_name":"Neil Ely","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679ec69ca57909701acb524f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2735767,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Mortlock","original_name":"Paul Mortlock","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679ec6aaa74d8ee23b263b29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Ely","original_name":"Neil Ely","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679ec6b9e99df23a9f2638f2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lloyd Eyre-Morgan","original_name":"Lloyd Eyre-Morgan","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/1AqrwWESHz44u1869O6SrKjawje.jpg","credit_id":"679ec6c4f0f9dbdba6955a4d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lloyd Eyre-Morgan","original_name":"Lloyd Eyre-Morgan","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/1AqrwWESHz44u1869O6SrKjawje.jpg","credit_id":"679ec6d0a74d8ee23b263b37","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35820335","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8UKS1fmoReGfVPY2yQ2V5lO29VT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/f7tWiwedxyIMg69D41deC8SxmxG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fidu1SlLHN7Wh6TJ4xGO02q4aBc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Manchester Film Festival ","release_date":"2025-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
