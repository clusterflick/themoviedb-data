A student, about to leave his classroom, suddenly finds himself trapped in a mysterious time loop, reliving the same moment repeatedly. As frustration builds, he begins to question reality, searching for a way out. The answer, however, lies in the simplest of acts—switching off the fan. Through its surreal and mind-bending narrative, Vane delivers a thought-provoking message on energy conservation, proving that even the smallest choices can break the cycle and make a difference.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/bVRh4fb7kEmYfJHi0iWluOTpsSY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2025-01-01","revenue":50,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Some loops are meant to be broken—one switch at a time.\"","title":"Vane","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5220145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"r abdul razzak","original_name":"r abdul razzak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Anonymous","credit_id":"679f87d350f5d47625261286","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5220031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A Abdulkani","original_name":"A Abdulkani","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/g7OjCNhodojNDqzVZgiRZRHV1GI.jpg","credit_id":"679f846e02a74dc73f955043","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5220118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"suhail","original_name":"suhail","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679f8482601ebc9870cb26fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5220026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chaitanya juttiga","original_name":"Chaitanya juttiga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679f84997ebb0614ff264f71","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5220121,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"dhavanithi sv","original_name":"dhavanithi sv","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679f84be50f5d476252611e7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5220022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E Mahizhnan","original_name":"E Mahizhnan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679f84fea74d8ee23b264e66","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5220141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"neethimaaran","original_name":"neethimaaran","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679f8798e99df23a9f265350","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5220031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A Abdulkani","original_name":"A Abdulkani","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/g7OjCNhodojNDqzVZgiRZRHV1GI.jpg","credit_id":"679f87f104cb6f41b9cb68df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5220118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"suhail","original_name":"suhail","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679f880104cb6f41b9cb68e5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242172,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Santhan Anebajagane","original_name":"Santhan Anebajagane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679f8e0b50f5d47625261540","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5220031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A Abdulkani","original_name":"A Abdulkani","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/g7OjCNhodojNDqzVZgiRZRHV1GI.jpg","credit_id":"679f8e1aa89359141595606d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/engyZwfOlCw2Ul3mJkT9VjS3SXq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1919}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1518,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bVRh4fb7kEmYfJHi0iWluOTpsSY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":346203,"name":"vane"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
