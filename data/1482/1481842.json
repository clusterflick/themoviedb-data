Like thousands of other young women of the time, Lemlich worked in a clothing factory, 7 days a week, from 60 to 80 hours, for less than a living wage. In addition to its biographical portrait of Lemlich, the film also chronicles the historic International Ladies Garment Workers' Union strike. One of the companies that refused to sign the strike's resulting agreement was the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, where, the following year, a fire resulted in the death of 146 young women, a tragedy that galvanized public support for the union and better working and safety conditions.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clara Lemlich: A Strike Leader's Diary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5441139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Szalat","original_name":"Alex Szalat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68265fc920415f9e284b55d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
