The film weaves together exclusive interviews and footage from event planning and the dance itself, and news coverage of public controversy surrounding the event-- all while exploring the burnout E experiences along the way.  In the end, Pride Prom is about the emotional toll of fighting for inclusion at an institution torn between progressive optics and traditional values... and the moments of joy and community that make it all worthwhile.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pride Prom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5440851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robyn Di Giacinto","original_name":"Robyn Di Giacinto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682632c09b20cff7d67686ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5440853,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Cat Bell","original_name":"Cat Bell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682632e46479b8d42a767f7b","department":"Crew","job":"Second Unit"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5440855,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nick Volkers","original_name":"Nick Volkers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6826330220331e815dada364","department":"Crew","job":"Second Unit"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":169213,"name":"milwaukee wisconsin"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Milwaukee Film Festival","release_date":"2019-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Grand Rapids Feminist Film Festival","release_date":"2019-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
