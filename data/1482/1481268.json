This undisputed tearjerker, written by the brilliant Italian composer (\"Madame Butterfly\", \"Tosca\") in the last years of the 19th century, still touches the hearts of viewers. In the summer of 2024, it will be shown in a new staging at the famous Verona Arena di Verona amphitheater, where every evening - during the Opera Festival held since 1913 - over 20,000 spectators watch great performances. The huge stage under the summer open sky was transformed into a snow-covered 19th-century Paris, and the performance featured international stars. We will now see all this on the big screen.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Bohème - Arena di Verona","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5439178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliana Grigoryan","original_name":"Juliana Grigoryan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6825113c98c1c15d746ef156","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vittorio Grigolo","original_name":"Vittorio Grigolo","popularity":0.4084,"profile_path":"/wv5ZDtbGF8I0Rnt9ibQWKtO3edG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68251144d29db99e9b7e8961","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1507503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Micheletti","original_name":"Luca Micheletti","popularity":0.2905,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68251150752abbbbf85a3987","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4529656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleonora Bellocci","original_name":"Eleonora Bellocci","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6825115c58de2675047e8b2a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabio Previati","original_name":"Fabio Previati","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6825116a9dc9d442965a3801","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5439181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfonso Signorini","original_name":"Alfonso Signorini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682511800ad43281543154d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Oren","original_name":"Daniel Oren","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/iy7Q72UxuaZ2MCSSHzojVFtuzdq.jpg","credit_id":"682511a02d3940eba55a381d","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
