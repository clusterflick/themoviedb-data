Determined to protect his son from the same fate, Avtar trains a young Arjan Singh Bhullar in Kushti. Fast forward to 2021—Arjan, now a Commonwealth Games Gold Medalist, prepares to challenge Brandon Vera for the ONE FC World Heavyweight Title. But this is more than a fight—it’s a battle for identity, pride, and the hopes of two nations: Canada and India.\r Featuring exclusive commentary from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ariel Helwani, Daniel Cormier, and Russell Peters, Title Fight is a deeply human story about heritage, resilience, and triumph.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/nsQJsH5ax5kfhSp7Hr90oYtLOOF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83202,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ambassador","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Father’s Fight, A Son’s Destiny","title":"Title Fight","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Title Fight: Between Two Worlds","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5438763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arjan Singh Bhullar","original_name":"Arjan Singh Bhullar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6824e6895558e7c675a17110","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1186633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Trudeau","original_name":"Justin Trudeau","popularity":1.1579,"profile_path":"/gFyQlypOoi1A9cBHhg3n9rvXcEx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6824e69481fecc63912d2a0b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Peters","original_name":"Russell Peters","popularity":0.6831,"profile_path":"/x0o1NclxcwvvliVR95NKjgMDwD7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6824e69eb757367b502d23a3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Cormier","original_name":"Daniel Cormier","popularity":0.602,"profile_path":"/u9h790OvxeIuzF6u95qFcTDgNdT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6824e6b7af666020377e88f9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1918965,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Surina Jindal","original_name":"Surina Jindal","popularity":0.4764,"profile_path":"/2T7UjJ5XJ96JulSjeiHFfkrtFA.jpg","credit_id":"6824e6c95834ae58f45a39e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5438767,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Luke Versalko","original_name":"Luke Versalko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6824e6d55ecb61e45d5a38dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3121096,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"J.
