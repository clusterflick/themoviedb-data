The film aggregates fragmentary encounters from varying points of view, encountering cuttlefish and quasars, and much else in between, happened upon during a transcontinental journey to film the shadow of the moon.  Challenging, in the tradition of Brechtian distanciation, the film is also poetic, ethereal, roving, contemplative, richly cinematic and empathetically engaged. Signatures of Earth presents a fractured vision of the cognitive and sensory muddle that is an antipodean road trip through the Anthropocene. It all makes sense as long as long as you donâ€™t want it too.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2FvOHXJ2wgM28zQkbF2gdeELlOz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Signatures of Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Nugent","original_name":"Robert Nugent","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68266da15e0477a6415a3f40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1027506,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sam Petty","original_name":"Sam Petty","popularity":0.4641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68266de2bcb6c186156ef974","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Nugent","original_name":"Robert Nugent","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68266def0e00cf26f46efae0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Nugent","original_name":"Robert Nugent","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68266df9e4cbb41e170a82d3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Nugent","original_name":"Robert Nugent","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68266e036fc01eec6ea1770a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hL4dxEZPq6u86ZJxNjWmMRnTZQ2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2FvOHXJ2wgM28zQkbF2gdeELlOz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
