Some are wild, some harnessed by man. Some inspire and renew, others stand as boundaries and battlegrounds.  Five Rivers Five Voices tells the story of five great American rivers and the remarkable people who love and protect them. This visually stunning portrait takes you through the white water rapids of the Middle Fork of Idaho's Salmon River; throught the heart of the Yellowstone River with its vast wildlife; along the Rio Grande River that is a fluid boarder between the United States and Mexico; down one of Utah's most beautiful rivers, the San Juan, as it snakes through a red rock paradise; and down the Colorado River, featuring some of the most dramatic white water in North America.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":94564,"logo_path":null,"name":"KUED","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five Rivers Five Voices","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
