The game is on. Younger son Lino has lived in the bullying shadow of older brother Rocco all his life. Rocco's a chancer who'll stop at nothing to win and doesn't care who gets hurt. Lulu, the quirky quality control girl at the factory makes a 'special recipe' ice cream reserved for parties held by her brother Joe, an unscrupulous and brutal man with a shady past - It tastes amazing and people want more and more and more of it - but what is the secret ingredient? Will the competition tear the brothers apart and destroy the family business forever...? All the Ordinary Angels is a story of sibling rivalry, the descent into the underbelly of illicit substance use and the consequences of winning at any cost.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/bdMSSA7vUW0cwhb6X0jUx9t3P7W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":262390,"logo_path":null,"name":"The British Youth Film Academy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All the Ordinary Angels","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2792060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Eastham","original_name":"Rebecca Eastham","popularity":0.1598,"profile_path":"/i1GmrlGQNIip3KrSRRAxziDZ0eI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bernie","credit_id":"6825e6100d8c06ce884b55c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1231402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Bonnar","original_name":"Mark Bonnar","popularity":2.3939,"profile_path":"/qEOp1lj0HGAVy1wpqIxMNkxIzn7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Taylor","credit_id":"6825e637f603e29841767e04","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Gaskell","original_name":"Lucy Gaskell","popularity":0.8658,"profile_path":"/yLWdCQAfCTpUS6VxSTkX30ZBfD9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mimi","credit_id":"6825e646046f5706450a8107","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2662431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alix Austin","original_name":"Alix Austin","popularity":0.3536,"profile_path":"/6JT7DtC2uDbS9yLZEBbV5QW2jd4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Donna","credit_id":"6825e65a22ecc43daeada49a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5440286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amie Butler","original_name":"Amie Butler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lulu","credit_id":"6825e678fbfbd20acb2d2c4b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5062223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Hird","original_name":"Christopher Hird","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Lino","credit_id":"6825e68dcc948059285a3ab5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5440287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliot Pritchard","original_name":"Elliot Pritchard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Steven","credit_id":"6825e6a220331e815dada217","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brennan Delaney","original_name":"Brennan Delaney","popularity":0.2194,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Giuseppe","credit_id":"6825e6d1752abbbbf85a3c73","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5440289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Alyn Stephens","original_name":"Hugo Alyn Stephens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Club DJ","credit_id":"6825e6fc4d6c1005af767e70","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4301719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Lovell","original_name":"Simon Lovell","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6825e5fe32ecbbefea5a3a79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4046896","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":838,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bdMSSA7vUW0cwhb6X0jUx9t3P7W.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":559}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
