Usually it is seen as an immutable part of Italian society. Yet in the 1990s a small group of shopkeepers in a village in northern Sicily formed an association to publicly denounce this deeply entrenched racketâ€”and a revolt against the culture of the Pizzo began. ANTIRACKET is the story of their revolt, now joined by over 70 other \"Antiracket\" associations across Italy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antiracket","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ludovica Tortora De Falco","original_name":"Ludovica Tortora De Falco","popularity":0.3868,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68265ddea39639cda24b54d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
