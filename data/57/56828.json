They declare that they are here to destroy the one who saved the future, and make ready to attack Dexter. Dexter easily destroys them with the use of various tools and gadgets from his lab. However, news that he is \"The One Who Saved the Future\" intrigues him, and he decides to travel through time to discover how cool he is. In the first time period he visits, Dexter finds a tall, skinny, weak version of himself working in office-designing cubicles, with Mandark as his rich, successful boss. The child Dexter unwittingly reveals the existence of blueprints regarding the \"Neurotomic Protocore\", and Mandark steals it after the two Dexters move forward in time.","popularity":3.0975,"poster_path":"/dv12cw5V1RbglIOiwMto4r3STdf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1353,"logo_path":"/yXhCcOFK5Fy3ZBQwhBYx8Zu9ZIw.png","name":"Hanna-Barbera Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dexter's Laboratory: Ego Trip","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":108,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El Laboratorio de Dexter: Viaje al Ego","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"덱스터의 실험실 : 시간여행","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Il laboratorio di Dexter - Viaggio nel futuro","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Laboratorium Dextera: Wyprawa w przyszłość","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"デクスターズ ラボ エゴ・トリップ","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Le laboratoire de Dexter: Voyage dans le temps","type":"Video Box Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"O Laboratório de Dexter: A Viagem de Dexter","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Декстерова лабораторија: Путовање у будућност","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Лаборатория Декстера: Путешествие в своё будущее","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Cavanaugh","original_name":"Christine Cavanaugh","popularity":0.2727,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dexter / D22 / Old Man Dexter (voice)","credit_id":"5a3db2ec0e0a2620e9006314","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Deezen","original_name":"Eddie Deezen","popularity":0.4752,"profile_path":"/AqjxoV14Jd3p5uvPsSPoAHmzQHI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mandark / Executive Mandark / Overlord Mandark / Braindark (voice)","credit_id":"5a3db2fc9251411fd200196b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Bennett","original_name":"Jeff Bennett","popularity":1.7149,"profile_path":"/6Fq3Q1e0Oz0j2J2fnFSl7fKCHd9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mandark Robot / Dad / Robot #1 / Officer 9412 (voice)","credit_id":"5a3db30fc3a3680bc7005e77","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":60739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kath Soucie","original_name":"Kath Soucie","popularity":0.8614,"profile_path":"/62hvT4USvGa9OAsMP9guIBtJqkf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mom / Head Secretary (voice)","credit_id":"5a3db3229251411fd2001995","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kat Cressida","original_name":"Kat Cressida","popularity":0.2999,"profile_path":"/np4jO1Qdv5Ch6DuFeWy8ZYolQQl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dee Dee (voice)","credit_id":"5a3db330c3a3680bbc005f11","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Kenny","original_name":"Tom Kenny","popularity":1.711,"profile_path":"/dKOxpGnRkIMaPkZSHKIns99WxQa.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Curator / Village Man / Robot #2 / Computer / Man (voice)","credit_id":"5a3db3410e0a2620ef0061d1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Genndy Tartakovsky","original_name":"Genndy Tartakovsky","popularity":0.469,"profile_path":"/neLR8ws82ezlbhOyUvhtLXwQZWL.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4915c3a36847f81883af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1218981,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Savino","original_name":"Chris Savino","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":"/1bhVQMyLtEbifKvDj8k3DRstCqO.jpg","credit_id":"65a6d3dd27db61012ce0a6e7","department":"Art","job":"Storyboard Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1077844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David P.
