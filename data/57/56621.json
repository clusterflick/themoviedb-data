As the only elder who knows \"Woohoo\" can no longer perform, his filial granddaughter put up a misleading advertisement which in turn attracts five youngsters from different backgrounds - bad-tempered bank security man Ah Beng, indecisive Char Kuey Teow hawker Ah Huat, effeminate designer Rain, university student Bobby and smart alec Alan - to be trained as 'woohoo' players. After some tough training, they finally look like a formidable team. However, few days before the anticipated festival day, the only 'tiger head\"'is accidentally destroyed by the mischievous kids in the village.","popularity":0.0985,"poster_path":"/2aImepZpTtSSC6WPgPbtFFYU68s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2010-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tiger Woohoo","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","title":"大日子","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Royce Tan","original_name":"Royce Tan","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe490ac3a36847f8186559","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Lim","original_name":"Jack Lim","popularity":0.3946,"profile_path":"/lkXiQB4M9turPSI1zgnqyGWRUAE.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe490ac3a36847f818655d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Hiew","original_name":"Bernard Hiew","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"","credit_id":"63dd174fcd204600c30a0f41","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3904035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yeoh Eng Kooi","original_name":"Yeoh Eng Kooi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"","credit_id":"63dd1772373ac20093cb5200","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiu Keng Guan","original_name":"Chiu Keng Guan","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":"/7fF3usNIb6Rc8bbW3TEvhmQooHh.jpg","credit_id":"63dd1707373ac200cafca1ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3793368","wikidata_id":"Q10935588","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2aImepZpTtSSC6WPgPbtFFYU68s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
