In the world of professional bull riding, newcomer Ely Braxton (Marcus Thomas) is the craziest guy around; his brother Hank (Kiefer Sutherland) is a rodeo clown, and the two use each other to play up their acts. But love may be one thing that tears the brothers apart. When Ely falls for the rodeo's sweetheart (Daryl Hannah), Hank is filled with jealousy and hatred. The brothers try to come to grips with their differences, but the competition gets as fierce as the bulls in the ring.","popularity":2.2155,"poster_path":"/aw2yvnfqwTumWzvFO78hWUhDcwE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14589,"logo_path":"/5WrEKsyGdTfT3T075EukSoIuxSU.png","name":"Code
