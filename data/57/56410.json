Due to a weak economy, her brother Jim (Harry Hamlin) has converted the family business from a cattle farm into a sheep farm, despite their father's (Lawrence Dane) objections. To help out, Lisa decides she will stay to help on the farm. She adopts a border collie from the local animal shelter and trains it as a sheepdog, naming the dog Lucky. Jim and Lisa decide to enter Lucky into a sheep herding contest, but when a severe thunderstorm sparks a forest fire, Lucky helps rescue trapped children and bring them to safety. While doing so, Lucky gets her leg burned, and it looks as if she will not be able to compete.","popularity":1.2596,"poster_path":"/zxKIp8GCJgxo44JxVfo685NYa9A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4598,"logo_path":"/y76nXOApEqxNI3EJFOikI1nhxx4.png","name":"Chesler/Perlmutter
