It is no longer the ninth and last planet in the solar system, which greatly annoys Pierre-Olivier. Jérôme wants to reveal his feelings to the one he loves, Nicolas and Steve are looking for a name for their punk band, Émilie is organizing a party despite herself? An almost normal day on this little piece of the planet. Played by young people aged 15 and 16, West of Pluto follows the existence of a dozen teenagers from the suburbs over 24 hours. This crossover which mixes humor and drama reflects their concerns and their way of seeing the world. A disturbingly realistic portrait, the film plunges into the heart of adolescence, this intense and fascinating period when everyone tries to exist among others and tries to make sense of the absurdity of everyday life.","popularity":0.3384,"poster_path":"/9ULnnRFxSa1DUQ8Pen4fKJpZ4P5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":211714,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vostok Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West of Pluto","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexis Drolet","original_name":"Alexis Drolet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jérôme","credit_id":"5301349bc3a3680a370dc8ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bouchard","original_name":"David Bouchard","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/dHVIpuLk6pj6wYUBXC7sZCwowif.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pierre-Olivier","credit_id":"53013471c3a36809fd0e316c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2297116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Sophie Lamontagne","original_name":"Anne-Sophie Lamontagne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/3ALHUXBSSdLalOldl6ybHU8mIQp.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Kim","credit_id":"6535941fc14fee00ad9e7e77","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoann Linteau","original_name":"Yoann Linteau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Benoît \"Paluche\"","credit_id":"530134ccc3a3680a110ec066","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1293451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Jacques","original_name":"Sandra Jacques","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Émilie Bégin","credit_id":"530134b2c3a3680a090e652c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4334221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micaël Minguy-Bédard","original_name":"Micaël Minguy-Bédard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Nicolas","credit_id":"65359436abdafc00acf81eb2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4813537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yann Bédard","original_name":"Yann Bédard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":29,"character":"Kevin","credit_id":"6688f17c3a2689744ea391e9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4334224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc-Alexandre Paradis","original_name":"Marc-Alexandre Paradis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Steve Labbé","credit_id":"65359457c14fee00c6ee5098","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1418033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Marchand","original_name":"Denis Marchand","popularity":0.2744,"profile_path":"/tQQ6PDzcbRVPTv4TKTxJOO6Fwxx.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Gaetan","credit_id":"61d67708e194b000649d2703","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Gionet-Lavigne","original_name":"Thomas Gionet-Lavigne","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/20anIk04huWm6eiXQpktHaXZEpj.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Le frère d'Émilie Bégin","credit_id":"530134aac3a3680a030d54d1","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1293447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédérique Boivin-Lafrance","original_name":"Frédérique Boivin-Lafrance","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nath","credit_id":"53013469c3a3680a030d4b2d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1293446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Beauséjour","original_name":"Caroline Beauséjour","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Isa","credit_id":"53013454c3a3680a190e72cd","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4334222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia Paquet","original_name":"Cynthia Paquet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Véro","credit_id":"6535944991f0ea00fe1a5e6b","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4813544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Pier B.
