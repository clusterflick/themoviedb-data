He plans to go to Oregon by taking advantage of the prairie winds. First, he wins over the town mayor, falls in love with the mayor's beautiful daughter, Molly Crum, and then secures financial backing from the townspeople. He sets sail across the plains, with Molly Crum as a covered-wagon stowaway, and a Kansas twister looming on the horizon. And, then, the wind hits the sails. And the fan, too, if he had had one.","popularity":0.8377,"poster_path":"/5PL57svoiXOU36x8g0nfSX3aW4u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1961-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Saga of Windwagon Smith","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rex Allen","original_name":"Rex Allen","popularity":0.2008,"profile_path":"/84GIqHLj6ksxJYeOdbysv198fxZ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe48e9c3a36847f81803af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rex Allen","original_name":"Rex Allen","popularity":0.2008,"profile_path":"/84GIqHLj6ksxJYeOdbysv198fxZ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Windwagon Smith (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48e9c3a36847f81803b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":195917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Brady","original_name":"Pat Brady","popularity":0.1298,"profile_path":"/whOf4zW9leuVbnbfpe1kiyS5x5p.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Band Member","credit_id":"52fe48e9c3a36847f81803bb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Doss","original_name":"Tommy Doss","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Band Member","credit_id":"52fe48e9c3a36847f81803bf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Farr","original_name":"Hugh Farr","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/ddgahCIWZRN2v56gs8wOGSXFT9V.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Band Member","credit_id":"52fe48e9c3a36847f81803c3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Farr","original_name":"Karl Farr","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Band Member","credit_id":"52fe48e9c3a36847f81803c7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
