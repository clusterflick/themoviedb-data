He is forty years old and lives together with his mother in a desolate block of flats. Ever since his early youth women with big breasts have fascinated him, because they symbolise a kind of earth mother to him. He has never had an especially close relationship with his own mother; she was too 'bony' for him. Object of Rene's fantasy is the actress Senta Berger, to him everything a woman should be. Standing by the blackboard and explaining the mathematical laws of sine and cosine ('sinus' is bosom in Latin), Rene sings the praises of the female curves and those of Santa Berger in particular. Filmmaker Ulrich Seidl let the former teacher speak freely about his obsessions and desires, intercutting his monologues with scenes from the protagonist's day-to-day life.","popularity":0.1384,"poster_path":"/gFIGpujg02SineAs4KTzYjFwhJE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37058,"logo_path":"/pWUIywEOdy0650kBbuRw5aI90zA.png","name":"Lotus-Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1997-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bosom Friend","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Rupnik","original_name":"René Rupnik","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58377c8b925141319201a3fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2956692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Rupnik","original_name":"Anna Rupnik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6013f8e35ad76b004170d83b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrich Seidl","original_name":"Ulrich Seidl","popularity":0.3538,"profile_path":"/jvZeADVhGC5PytZlRmWqfEtls8f.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4902c3a36847f8184ead","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1468159,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Enzo Brandner","original_name":"Enzo Brandner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kOpVNbltNoWIzRd1KSE9m1WBxtg.jpg","credit_id":"62c7962612c60400679e3d5b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48079,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hans Selikovsky","original_name":"Hans Selikovsky","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c7963612c604004ca7d5d0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6826,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Zeitlinger","original_name":"Peter Zeitlinger","popularity":0.1328,"profile_path":"/f3ynhWcaT5WOyNEVNWToEleA34K.jpg","credit_id":"62c7962012c604004ca7d5b9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240445,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jerzy Palacz","original_name":"Jerzy Palacz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c79617907f26147ed6c2bc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1596938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Andreas Christen","original_name":"Walter Andreas Christen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6d6b98c3a368188f14861a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrich Seidl","original_name":"Ulrich Seidl","popularity":0.3538,"profile_path":"/jvZeADVhGC5PytZlRmWqfEtls8f.jpg","credit_id":"5b6d6a87c3a36853750b34e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erich Lackner","original_name":"Erich Lackner","popularity":0.1054,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6d6abb9251414068142ba9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1596938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Andreas Christen","original_name":"Walter Andreas Christen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6d6aaec3a368189912f4a9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0409785","wikidata_id":"Q13469573","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mtlMvGK37e2KVArTaqzyHQBnBdT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/gFIGpujg02SineAs4KTzYjFwhJE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":861,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/jqgj2BTRN9O6Of52zWh5lYF0MHN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
