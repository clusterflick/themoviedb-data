The world of trainwriters, those spray paint artists who specialize in painting trams and underground trains. Extremely undercover. Extremely criminal. Extremely forbidden. UNLIKE U portrais four generations of sprayers in Berlin, of which the oldest of the hardcore artists is already over 40 years old, while the youngest are around 17. All protagonists have one thing in common. Each one has sprayed countless trains in their lives, some of them even over a 1000.","popularity":0.2718,"poster_path":"/xRAXXpk74EkEB9SJxgdYhUyQsR7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6753,"logo_path":null,"name":"HISKICK productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"trainwriting in berlin","title":"Unlike U","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henrik Regel","original_name":"Henrik Regel","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4913c3a36847f8187eaf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Björn Birg","original_name":"Björn Birg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4913c3a36847f8187ea9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1836994","wikidata_id":"Q28599983","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jGr6Ks6SeleIfLmYjtlcBj81uVJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/xRAXXpk74EkEB9SJxgdYhUyQsR7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/npT0WlrLVbWiNpBDa6szQrKFkRB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220,"name":"berlin, germany"},{"id":2815,"name":"graffiti"},{"id":332382,"name":"trainwriting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
