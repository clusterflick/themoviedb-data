When a sign is posted advertising a matchmaking party with city women, all the men gussy themselves up and videotape themselves for the dating service. Manzo borrows a camcorder and tries his luck, but his rehearsed speech doesn't go as planned. When showing the videotape to the prospective dates, he discovers something unusual: There is a woman and her son living in one of his closets. Instead of kicking them out, he encourages them to stay and develops a relationship with them that makes the other fishermen jealous.","popularity":0.2069,"poster_path":"/w5Lj0pkgfhl9FMh0Z0oQwXuux0I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark Harbour","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinya Kote","original_name":"小手伸也","popularity":0.5301,"profile_path":"/ju6WP0tDuJJmsPlxCuZ1NQwc8Yl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe48f4c3a36847f8182219","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1044576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuko Miyamoto","original_name":"宮本裕子","popularity":0.309,"profile_path":"/fRRCm3s3t47Zo4GHqGewzMg7GVb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe48f4c3a36847f8182221","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1064142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuki Hiro'oka","original_name":"Kazuki Hiro'oka","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe48f4c3a36847f8182215","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akaji Maro","original_name":"麿赤兒","popularity":0.7652,"profile_path":"/lvgPJd8MeHEyqeR18oo5Gq7u7ED.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe48f4c3a36847f818221d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1064144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terumi Norizuki","original_name":"Terumi Norizuki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Wife","credit_id":"52fe48f4c3a36847f8182225","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1064145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yûjirô Taki","original_name":"Yûjirô Taki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe48f4c3a36847f8182229","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1064141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takatsugu Naitô","original_name":"Takatsugu Naitô","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48f4c3a36847f8182211","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1680450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Matsuo","original_name":"松尾崇","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6645ce2af3511a7a502dbafa","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1368460","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w5Lj0pkgfhl9FMh0Z0oQwXuux0I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
