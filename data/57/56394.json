Their journey to the Olympus of Glory is full of surprises, falls, and curiosities, especially after the strange hair manager LEO takes over to lead the group. Their lives are full of passion, loss, and frustration, because everyone falls in love with the same muse -- a traveling girl named Inda. Their music spreads the romance of \"flowers and children\" and the nostalgia of lost times, because they are the Last Musicians in Bremen.","popularity":0.2635,"poster_path":"/sg6XbWaZWne75y0hSN8MnQCM6v6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2005-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Musicians in Bremen","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrius Kaniava","original_name":"Andrius Kaniava","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/cjZfQxpIeNN1qcHc0sjKw6ELz4i.jpg","cast_id":1000,"character":"Dovydas Petuchauskas","credit_id":"52fe48fec3a36847f8183ff9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dalius Skamarakas","original_name":"Dalius Skamarakas","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Olegas Rainis","credit_id":"52fe48fec3a36847f8183ffd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224119,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aidas Giniotis","original_name":"Aidas Giniotis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Rexas","credit_id":"52fe48fec3a36847f8184001","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurimas Meliešius","original_name":"Aurimas Meliešius","popularity":0.103,"profile_path":"/eonrxu3tsH9e8Bbjc9cWLzg07nW.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Vidas Kanopa","credit_id":"52fe48fec3a36847f8184005","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darius Auželis","original_name":"Darius Auželis","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Leo","credit_id":"52fe48fec3a36847f8184009","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilona Balsytė","original_name":"Ilona Balsytė","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/laMyrVxFtuZ7cZZm1ldEYc76yrz.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Inga","credit_id":"52fe48fec3a36847f818400d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vaidas Lekavičius","original_name":"Vaidas Lekavičius","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48fec3a36847f8184013","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2342249","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sg6XbWaZWne75y0hSN8MnQCM6v6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1084},{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hYY3o6F3TkrfMe32fCNF5rEov5Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":888,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6E0z84FCjblLe9p6ErPosjpjzaZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lt","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
