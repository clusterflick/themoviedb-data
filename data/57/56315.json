Its main characters are a husband and wife who are leading a seemingly ideal suburban life. But is everything really as perfect as it seems? The animators used mechanized tin figurines set in brightly colored, saturated tin surroundings emulating quaint suburbia. The characters are attached to the ground and move in predetermined courses (grooves and tracks set in the ground), expressing the repetition of their lives.","popularity":0.8627,"poster_path":"/edSU1WskHFWiSEeT9sSuywjjIZx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Abrams","original_name":"Aaron Abrams","popularity":0.64,"profile_path":"/JBmN6Byyo1QSKIagjbCrTFX96I.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mitch (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48f9c3a36847f8182cad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Foley","original_name":"Dave Foley","popularity":1.3038,"profile_path":"/muHRRGDTE7ZWk3guqDAk9L4DqVX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"John (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48f9c3a36847f8182cb1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurie Murdoch","original_name":"Laurie Murdoch","popularity":0.3965,"profile_path":"/mUvUrp5h9wBcTFjlK2FDHLYgAr4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Chuck (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48f9c3a36847f8182cb5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1222890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Ballantyne","original_name":"Linda Ballantyne","popularity":0.1237,"profile_path":"/sCyTies9tcMuL0SNBrPc2l22BvV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jane (voice)","credit_id":"6601a2e162f335017d53c032","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jesse Rosensweet","original_name":"Jesse Rosensweet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48f9c3a36847f8182cbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jesse Rosensweet","original_name":"Jesse Rosensweet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48f9c3a36847f8182cc1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59935,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steven Hoban","original_name":"Steven Hoban","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/zChL93hWGyNgkAeOxD5G2u5CWYf.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48f9c3a36847f8182cc7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937718,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeremy Benning","original_name":"Jeremy Benning","popularity":0.1086,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48f9c3a36847f8182ccd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0981064","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c4oavKM2vBZTHIrctPeuaqDj9o3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/edSU1WskHFWiSEeT9sSuywjjIZx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
