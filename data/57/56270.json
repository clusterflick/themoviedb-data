It follows the story of two best friends, Fabio and Naama, as they navigate their way between the pitfalls of life in the slums and the joys of surfing on their favorite beach. Their goal: to win the contest and become professional surfers. Thirteen-year-old Fabio and 12-year-old Naama live at Favela do Pavao, an enormous slum near Arpoador Beach, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Pavao is home to Commando Vermelho (CV), or Red Command, one of Rio's most heavily armed drug gangs. It's the Red Command who sets the rules and regulates life in the community. Their presence is ubiquitous, with armed soldiers constantly patrolling the hills and regulating the various points of sale. Fabio lives in an area of the favela called Vietnam, the poorest and most violent part of the slum.","popularity":0.1156,"poster_path":"/zgzwN6Lybk59zlurSTYBM5H9A2i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rio Breaks","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":898780,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vince Medeiros","original_name":"Vince Medeiros","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48f6c3a36847f81825e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":200670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Mitchell","original_name":"Justin Mitchell","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48f6c3a36847f81825f3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":200670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Mitchell","original_name":"Justin Mitchell","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48f6c3a36847f81825ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929873,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Maier","original_name":"John Maier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48f6c3a36847f81825e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1269704","wikidata_id":"Q24807533","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zgzwN6Lybk59zlurSTYBM5H9A2i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"RIO BREAKS Official Film Trailer","key":"va9tpEg8fqw","published_at":"2009-08-26T16:38:36.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6b2c3a3685448005e9d"}]}}}
