Despite numerous attempts we were left ungratified. Consequently, we sent a different iteration of the shot to 20 film experts, asking each one for their expert analysis. This is one of the shots accompanied by an analysis written by Phil Coldiron. The analysis will be read aloud prior to the screening.”","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Print Analysis (2 B)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan David González Monroy","original_name":"Juan David González Monroy","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f87ea05907de0163e72f4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anja Dornieden","original_name":"Anja Dornieden","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f87eb928723c017cba81d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
