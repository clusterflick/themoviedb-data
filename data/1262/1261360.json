For some, itâ€™s the tale of an ant that delved too deep, for others, a puppet seeking freedom. The narrative evolves with the viewer, offering no single path but rather a multitude of meanings.

Only through personal reflection will the answers reveal themselves, making the experience uniquely yours.","popularity":0.5303,"poster_path":"/1Y9JWCObllhitcMgIt1Sg8u63Nh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223892,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gate 23
