These short films are all under three minutes long and allow the filmmaker to explore a single formal or conceptual idea. The process of realisation can either be loose and improvisatory or time intensive and heavily edited. Each of the films uses either archival material, or footage Quaintance has shot using a DV of High 8 video camera. Using these mediums, instead of 16mm, allows for quicker production and a more intuitive approach.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/n0gFVPWsktE4woORAXqh7GJBPQX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strawberries","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2141542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morgan Quaintance","original_name":"Morgan Quaintance","popularity":0.0799,"profile_path":"/5CGXXVVVaZ12vnk4J48u4Mrh5ol.jpg","credit_id":"65f97c574b9bae01837ef829","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hxWipAOVAvNwAIXFueLATwfKzyQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n0gFVPWsktE4woORAXqh7GJBPQX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
