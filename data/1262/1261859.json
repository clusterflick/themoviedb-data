Here lies the town of Birdsville, 23 houses and a bar with a liquor license. The long-awaited telephone connection arrived in 1979, 90 years after it had been applied for. For one weekend, this place at the end of the world turns into a cauldron when 5,000 Australians, tired of civilization, invade for the annual horse race, the \"Birdsville Cup\". They come in buses, off-road vehicles, motorcycles and sports planes and have become a veritable plague. Because here, everyone can do what they've always wanted to do: for example, get drunk until they drop and never get up again. The collective mass drinking reaches its peak on Saturday night. By Monday morning, the fun is over. What remains is a village with 23 houses, a bar and a street littered with 80,000 empty beer cans.","popularity":0.1982,"poster_path":"/uCeMsGDihsKI8iWhMiJuGLmiEBx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219200,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oliver Herbrich Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":665,"logo_path":"/bUomMJoEX2W7XpgvNeWswCFKzrW.png","name":"Hochschule f端r Fernsehen und Film M端nchen","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":223970,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ludolph Weyer Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1986-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4576276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz A.
