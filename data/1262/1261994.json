She and her grandmother bond over their memories and affection towards him. As they spend slow afternoons together, talking about him, his patriarchal tendencies begin to surface. Alvina speaks to her father, and a childhood of fear and tyranny surfaces in her father’s recollections. Her grandmother’s experiences as a woman and a wife are colored by the same tyranny. These well kept secrets only had the tree outside the balcony and the walls of the house as witness, and their burden brings the house to life, and makes the tree restless.","popularity":0.2737,"poster_path":"/acoS8PXjbv8VZjx1VPi2GBY0fC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Grandfather's House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alvina Joshi","original_name":"Alvina Joshi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b3337a393e46d46a597021","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871695,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rajiv Mehrotra","original_name":"Rajiv Mehrotra","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b333878e387408ae771c26","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aparna Sanyal","original_name":"Aparna Sanyal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b33393e8469c9892a876b4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3465562,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"omkar khandagale","original_name":"omkar khandagale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b333ada97ae81fad2b127e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4155165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mehdi Jahan","original_name":"Mehdi Jahan","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/iOrRPcb5CBGSoEw5Pal6XghseLO.jpg","credit_id":"66b333c28c29853199fc7d14","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3618261,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rahul Rabha","original_name":"Rahul Rabha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b333d89d124823bc5e5b52","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3618261,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rahul Rabha","original_name":"Rahul Rabha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b333eba1d9c7a4fa2b1318","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871675,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tapanjyoti Phukan","original_name":"Tapanjyoti Phukan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b33412491f6a7554886912","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29468101","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/acoS8PXjbv8VZjx1VPi2GBY0fC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":310502,"name":"non-fiction"},{"id":335753,"name":"psbt india"},{"id":335754,"name":"psbt"},{"id":335807,"name":"doc_commune"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
