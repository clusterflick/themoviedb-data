However, over three centuries ago, we exterminated them. This film reveals the rise and fall of the Scottish wolf and explores the question of whether they should be re-introduced.  Wolves arrived as the last ice age ended, following the herds of deer and reindeer that crossed a now-lost land bridge from Europe. For thousands of years, wolves and humans shared the landscape as apex predators, with the wolf entering human art, myth and belief. However, farming put wolves and humans on a collision course, and, after centuries of persecution, wolves became extinct in Scotland. Since then, deer numbers have exploded, and many of Scotland’s woodlands have been stripped bare. Some argue for the wolf’s return. Could we, and should we, hear the howl of the wolf once more in the Highlands?","popularity":0.2969,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Gaelic","iso_639_1":"gd","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Am Madadh-Allaidh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4601546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhoda Meek","original_name":"Rhoda Meek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65f8cbda4d679101636965b3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Les Wilson","original_name":"Les Wilson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f8cb9215a4a101840c8359","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":388,"name":"scotland"},{"id":9902,"name":"wildlife"},{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":232116,"name":"wolves"},{"id":317123,"name":"rewilding"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"gd","note":"BBC ALBA","release_date":"2023-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
