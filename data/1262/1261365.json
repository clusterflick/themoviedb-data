According to the titles, it was shot by Michael D. Moore and Hunter Jackson at GWAR's second show with their own instruments. I'm not sure whether this means that it was their second show ever, and they were playing their own insturments, or if they played numerous other shows before with someone else's instruments. Either way, this rare piece of GWAR's prehistory has been shat forth like a petrified turd to shed some light on the dawn of the Scumdogs.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pubes In Phallusland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
