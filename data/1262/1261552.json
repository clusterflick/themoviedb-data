The captain, who lives alone, visits the Mariner's Home and relates the story of how he came into possession of the schooner. Manning was the first mate on the yacht of a wealthy man when it encountered the Swallow at sea. He went on board, accompanied by the drug-addicted son of his employer, and discovered a mutinous crew and a disabled captain fighting for control of the ship. Manning took charge and brought the ship safely to port, after successfully putting down the mutineers by humiliating their leader, who had kept them in fear by practicing voodoo in the ship's hold. Manning later married the captain's daughter. Now he controls the ship.","popularity":0.7506,"poster_path":"/w09A4ry343LJawDOSpUh1i6siRU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223922,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creative Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Who Dare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Superstition","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Trapped","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bowers","original_name":"John Bowers","popularity":0.0933,"profile_path":"/j6KhoMBcaddOHhyuHjXIUxAyjzP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Captain Manning","credit_id":"65f9739033a376018436ef0e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":128325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite De La Motte","original_name":"Marguerite De La Motte","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":"/lVTbD5zc5luU1vS64SPF2d7k8Ov.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marjorie","credit_id":"65f973a215a4a101840e195a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph J.
