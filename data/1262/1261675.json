Following Marie-Josée Béliveau, an ecologist and ethnogeographer, they journey together along the 4000 km from the mouth of the Amazon River in Brazil to one of its sources in Ecuador where they meet with the guardians of the forest. As a result, we witness powerful and spontaneous testimonies from local communities who are doing everything to preserve what remains of their lands, which are disappearing due to the inexorable advance of Western modernity.","popularity":0.9118,"poster_path":"/9QGNvybIyx8tkYtDbi0uv5f2XRg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223946,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Studio Via le monde","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amazonia, an Encounter with the Guardians of the Rainforest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santiago Bertolino","original_name":"Santiago Bertolino","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f9acaa07e2810186c23ffb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santiago Bertolino","original_name":"Santiago Bertolino","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f9ac97223e2001607a2bf7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891010,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anton Fischlin","original_name":"Anton Fischlin","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6626b320e54d5d017eee34d9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santiago Bertolino","original_name":"Santiago Bertolino","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6626b310e295b401879c13be","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785430,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stefan Christoff","original_name":"Stefan Christoff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6626b34de894a6014a3a3b86","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32187439","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3bi22F5CPzIIignIHGEa5iWQMJS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2592,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9QGNvybIyx8tkYtDbi0uv5f2XRg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":33577,"name":"environment"},{"id":167043,"name":"road movie"},{"id":217120,"name":"amazon river"},{"id":329338,"name":"amazônia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
