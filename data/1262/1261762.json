Two girls from a tiny Kyrgyz village lived together from birth: they had a common bladder, fused intestines and three legs for two. Doctors helped the Siamese twins to find a new life, but the girl's happiness was never achieved. The separated sisters had to go through severe depressive episodes and accept that they would never be able to start a family and have children. Neither of them was ready to lose each other, but in 2015, Zita died at the age of 24.","popularity":0.1996,"poster_path":"/8y8czepfoDAjDStKuDjo2jsax4U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119813,"logo_path":"/iyGJzcnWXZoNxYLzZu4jKzxIoFw.png","name":"Premier Studios","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zita and Gita","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2862968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Valeev","original_name":"Alexander Valeev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f9ca221c09fb014a5b500f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8y8czepfoDAjDStKuDjo2jsax4U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
