But the country is facing a the rise of a fierce nationalist sentiment targeting the Muslim community of the Rohingya people, and spread by a group of extremist Buddhist monks.  What role do the 500,000 monks really play in this country where feelings run high? Is Burmese Buddhism a racist and nationalistic movement? What lies behind the monastic orders?  Three monks – each engaged on their own path in a Burma in search of identity – express their views, their concerns, and their hopes. One speaks in defense of the Lady of Rangoon; another preaches Buddhism in the most remote regions of the land; while the third, a nationalist, strives for the defense of a national identity which he sees as under threat.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bruma, the power of the Monks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"BIRMANIE, LE POUVOIR DES MOINES","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2146807,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Benoît Grimont","original_name":"Benoît Grimont","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f9c3ecb84cdd01636c329b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
