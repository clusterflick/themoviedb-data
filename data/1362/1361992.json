Filmed in Berlin, the film explores the city through the prism if the film-maker, who experiences photophobia - a sensitivity to light, which is often painful and disorientating. Through the film-maker's lens, glimpses of Berlin play out in light and shade, and in positive and negative. In keeping with the film-makers embodied and phenomenological approach to film-making, the viewer encounters a sequence of visual experiences, which are interrupted by flashes of the inner workings of the eye. The use of silence further internalises and compounds the subjective experience.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2023-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Retina: A journey Through Photophobia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4963575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elaine Crowe","original_name":"Elaine Crowe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f4c4a75e354c501273d7be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
