Through this wordplay, we glimpse a recurring theme in Segal’s works: a subtler, less persuasive form of magic—the trick. Falso Sport is filled with visual games, presented as yet another instance of assembly and editing. In its persistent exposure of the artificiality of images—mostly cardboard models of intentionally precarious realism—the work reveals a power dynamic that dictates what is shown and what remains hidden.","popularity":0.0755,"poster_path":"/v4ULVpXr4xpUODpOVUmesEPRuRg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falso Sport","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2873037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Martín Segal","original_name":"Alan Martín Segal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f4169a21c481b1d4230780","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873038,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ailín Grad","original_name":"Ailín Grad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f416a63a95a5bcda2303d9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v4ULVpXr4xpUODpOVUmesEPRuRg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AdKdKtNGuMzngHw09ZTbfyfNvCD.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":166676,"name":"contemporary art"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
