He also created numerous programs that he administered within those prisons. In each program, students came face to face with thousands of incarcerated men and women in ways that opened students' eyes and minds in dramatic and unpredictable ways. In a word, students found humanity in people and places where they had previously imagined none to exist. Those lessons inspired that professor to craft a poem, called \"Sinners,\" to capture what those experiences meant to thousands of students. \"Sinners\" is read against the backdrop of illustrative scenes from Sutton's many award-winning prison documentaries.","popularity":0.1527,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":240015,"logo_path":null,"name":"Justus Educational Partners","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They found humanity in the most unlikely place...","title":"Sinners","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4963330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Val Cole","original_name":"Val Cole","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66f487840eca17da1b0e15b2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4963329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Sutton","original_name":"Paul Sutton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f48753824701db2f2323a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4963329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Sutton","original_name":"Paul Sutton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f4875f740138641e6a30d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4963329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Sutton","original_name":"Paul Sutton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f48767740138641e6a30dc","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4963329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Sutton","original_name":"Paul Sutton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f487740eca17da1b0e159e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4963331,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lori Sutton","original_name":"Lori Sutton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f487a75820d28cfb6a1890","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4963331,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lori Sutton","original_name":"Lori Sutton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f487aff5b4978643232853","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lori Sutton","original_name":"Lori Sutton","popularity":0.2842,"profile_path":"/zRODRjv0odXqWHTDOpak1kyGITj.jpg","credit_id":"66f487bc5820d28cfb6a189a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
