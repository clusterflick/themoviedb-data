The case of Ambrogio Crespi is much more than a judicial case; it is the answer to these unthinkable questions. It is the paradox that becomes reality. Accused of external complicity in mafia association, he is arrested and tried for having provided votes from mafia circles to a councilor Lombardo… never seen, never known. Although it seemed clear even to the insiders that Ambrogio Crespi was not involved in the charges, the first degree ends with an incredible sentence of 12 years, double the request of the same PM. A sentence that, like a guillotine, weighs on the life of Ambrogio and his entire family.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stato di Grazia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2683882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Telese","original_name":"Luca Telese","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Film director","credit_id":"66f43a090eca17da1b0dfca7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ambrogio Crespi","original_name":"Ambrogio Crespi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f43a3c5820d28cfb6a02ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2683882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Telese","original_name":"Luca Telese","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f43a620eca17da1b0dfcfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
