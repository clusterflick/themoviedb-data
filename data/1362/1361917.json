The film’s grain and texture reveal a genuine, unidealized beauty, celebrating the preciousness of the real and the imperfect. As Edgar Allan Poe wrote, \"There is no exquisite beauty… without some strangeness in the proportion,\" and Makamae captures that essence by finding beauty in what is raw, unique, and authentically human.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Makamae","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529274,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Simon Wakelin","original_name":"Simon Wakelin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f486a3f5b49786432327f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
