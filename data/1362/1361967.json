The work features two pieces of real-time footage that the artist filmed in Cape Cod, Massachusetts – one a sunset over the Atlantic Ocean and the other a sunrise on Cape Cod Bay – that are merged together and presented on a continual loop. As the sun slowly disappears into the ocean on one side, it rises out of the water on the other. In this new arrangement, the usual figure-ground relationship is upended: the sun becomes a fixed point at the centre of the image while the horizon line becomes unfixed, slowly wandering across the frame from top to bottom.","popularity":0.0984,"poster_path":"/yTYVLBvgFh9SA43cUpVn1EQtGoS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morning After the Deluge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2298158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Pfeiffer","original_name":"Paul Pfeiffer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f4a28a5e85b3b68ebe7611","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1518,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yTYVLBvgFh9SA43cUpVn1EQtGoS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1012}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":155450,"name":"cape cod"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
