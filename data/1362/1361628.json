To make things worse, he signs for arch-rivals Manchester City just before the Cup Final. Unknown to his adoring public, he has been kidnapped by crooked City boss Reggie Backhander, who has been creating experimental clones of great British footballers, but adding ape DNA to increase their strength and aggression.
