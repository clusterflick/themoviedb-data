In New Guinea, director Pierre-Dominique Gaisseau's crew spends time with jungle villagers who honor the deceased by preserving their corpses, and in Africa they film the resourceful people of the Kalahari. Other subjects include a Brazilian community whose male members wear lip-stretching jewelry.","popularity":0.1922,"poster_path":"/dFzOEyXsUatltWQqinIlNV0UKgs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The incredible but true story of the last savages!","title":"Flame and the Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"A Chama e o Fogo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Kuro no makyo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3457232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre-Dominique Gaisseau","original_name":"Pierre-Dominique Gaisseau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f4a868b217ea9990db3cd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115246,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Romine","original_name":"Charles Romine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f4a8875e85b3b68ebe77ba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7806900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1395,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/luzRFsm49BdKg5bzbyKt46p8j6G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2480}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":1210,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dFzOEyXsUatltWQqinIlNV0UKgs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":794}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":328270,"name":"mondo film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1966-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
