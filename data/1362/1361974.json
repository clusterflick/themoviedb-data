Conducted on the afternoon and evening of 21st February, 1984, it was held almost 500 years after the death of the last of the Plantagenet Kings, King Richard III, on Bosworth Field, the last of the English monarchs to die in battle.  The charges are that King Richard III did, in or about the month of August, 1483, in the Tower of London, murder Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, and Prince Richard, Duke of York.  Presiding over the case is Lord Elwyn-Jones, the former Lord Chancellor, and he is ably supported by two of Britain’s leading criminal Queen’s Counsels.  A fascinating trial which presents evidence which offers the viewer the opportunity to join the jury in weighing the evidence and reaching his or her own verdict before discovering that of the television jury.","popularity":0.1929,"poster_path":"/6UjGy4oOWzT3Z2TDPxoHMyj2jJa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6197,"logo_path":"/6LFn6YTFLtqNFkWw85csFErB2dv.png","name":"LWT","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":205,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trial of Richard III","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2507929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester","original_name":"Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/OfymWfHzshxpts2HaSxLP1Z9oA.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self - Introduction","credit_id":"66f4cfd84a01d2ba8a73d713","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4963600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Elwyn Jones","original_name":"Frederick Elwyn Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self - The Judge","credit_id":"66f4cc703335aba7a173d630","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Waller","original_name":"Kenneth Waller","popularity":0.1773,"profile_path":"/ql3x0A9h8gHjUW2uhaaVltmsuMV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Clerk of the Court","credit_id":"66f4ccab4f949c7a5c47bdc8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4963605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Richards","original_name":"Jeffrey Richards","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Witness for the Prosecution #1","credit_id":"66f4cd371d10a1709f47be38","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4963615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Ross","original_name":"Jean Ross","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Witness for the Prosecution #2","credit_id":"66f4cdce3335aba7a173d671","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4963617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.J.
