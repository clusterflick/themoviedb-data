Not because she likes the work so much, but because it allows her to be close to her father. A man who has withdrawn since the death of his wife. This can be seen in her care waiting at night until her father comes home, buying his daily ration of beer with the tattered power of attorney or in her childish naivety as she admires the golden stumbling blocks while sweeping them and doesn't know what they mean. We experience two days in the life of a child that oscillates between being an adult and a child. A life between small, intimate and special moments of happiness, but also the confrontation with everyday racism and pain.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/3nzXfDkwY2AL7pCe8ljhGVhw6HS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239980,"logo_path":null,"name":"Westlight Film","origin_country":""},{"id":239981,"logo_path":null,"name":"behind the screens UG","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Mongolian","iso_639_1":"mn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AAV","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4962595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iveel Namkhainyambuu","original_name":"Iveel Namkhainyambuu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mika","credit_id":"66f41cf05820d28cfb69fde8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4962597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mischel Bärmann","original_name":"Mischel Bärmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Batar","credit_id":"66f41d03824701db2f2307b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3563486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myriam Tancredi","original_name":"Myriam Tancredi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66f41d0f824701db2f2307bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4962598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Stein","original_name":"Christoph Stein","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jeff","credit_id":"66f41d2321c481b1d4230a77","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4962599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mia Schmidt","original_name":"Mia Schmidt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66f41d2f338357c70a6a06ea","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2098328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariunbolor Gansukh","original_name":"Ariunbolor Gansukh","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":"/eR7Zk0JzXY8mUOQI3jS1FgAh893.jpg","credit_id":"66f41d3f68628a2ec00def7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2098328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariunbolor Gansukh","original_name":"Ariunbolor Gansukh","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":"/eR7Zk0JzXY8mUOQI3jS1FgAh893.jpg","credit_id":"66f41d46338357c70a6a06ff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4962601,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kevin Jerome Stemberger","original_name":"Kevin Jerome Stemberger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f41d55338357c70a6a0711","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4291000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Noel Schardt","original_name":"Leon Noel Schardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f41d6621c481b1d4230a87","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4962602,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Naranzun Badruugan","original_name":"Naranzun Badruugan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f41d72f5b49786432308a9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4962603,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dulguun Bayasgala","original_name":"Dulguun Bayasgala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f41d8c4fd4ebe2240defb0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4962605,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Torsten Asmus","original_name":"Torsten Asmus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f41d9c0eca17da1b0df329","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1972709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enkelejd Lluca","original_name":"Enkelejd Lluca","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f41daa740138641e6a0062","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3nzXfDkwY2AL7pCe8ljhGVhw6HS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
