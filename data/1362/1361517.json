It is a perfect adjunct to courses in animal behavior, animal communication, and behavioral ecology. While it builds on the theme of the classic Lesser Black-backed Gull film by Nobel Laureate Niko Tinbergen, the logic and presentation are framed within current concepts and principles. Beautifully filmed at the Shoals Marine Laboratory in Maine and accessibly narrated, the core 38-minute presentation is divided into self-contained chapters entitled \"Territoriality and Aggression,\" \"Courtship and Mating,\" and \"Parental Care.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qaNs0G3SVVse6EoKn5wJFscyVA3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Signals for Survival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4961883,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David O.
