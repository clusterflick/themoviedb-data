Shot in emblematic locations such as the Legislative Yuan, Liberty Square, the National Human Rights Museum, 228 Memorial Park, and TSMC headquarters, the film juxtaposes these symbols of democracy and autonomy with monuments from the authoritarian past like the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and Cih-hu Memorial Statue Park.  Through these evocative images, the film reflects on the historical, diplomatic, and geopolitical tensions that have defined Taiwan for many centuries and specially since 1949, when the Kuomintang established its government on the island following the Japanese surrender in 1945. This work explores the Taiwanese paradox: a nation functioning as a sovereign democracy while navigating a diplomatic limbo, pursuing a political utopia where its self-determination might be fully recognized.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Dreams of Formosa / Formosa's Paradox","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4498227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Esperanza Collado","original_name":"Esperanza Collado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f907e49766181a1bd3bba6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"https://www.lightmatterfilmfestival.com/program-4-2025","release_date":"2025-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
