Each bulb replaced sends him back into the cold, where static, sermons, and silence haunt his drives. At the hardware store, a ghostly cashier hints at something beyond. When the last light fades, Stewart faces a celestial visitor and a choice: cling to the glow, or step into the dark. A slow-burning, surreal holiday tale of grief, ritual, and revelation.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tJqD4nEZqGtOu5WL8GD8jx6IF2L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A young man goes forth into the night to replace a light bulbâ€¦","title":"Lights Gone Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5766582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Hogue","original_name":"Christopher Hogue","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Stewart","credit_id":"68f95898e3e9f82cfcdd90e9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5766583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William R.
