He always went to play there to try to spot some creature, until one of the times he returned, he found it destroyed. He salvaged a few remaining pieces, and his mother stored them in a trunk in the basement.  That morning, after so many years, he decided to go down to the basement in search of the trunk. With it under his arm, he set off on a hike back into the forest to see the ruins of the village, hoping to find at least some sign of a creature living there. When he gave up on everything, he found a door in the trunk of an old tree. Behind it, the rebuilt village appeared, and the lights began to turn on.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/nwjf1Ubkqz5ApdNGIZRk70bMGkc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Gökotta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3588147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kay Oceans","original_name":"Kay Oceans","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f8cccdf734820aee9d2475","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nwjf1Ubkqz5ApdNGIZRk70bMGkc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Northern Lights Fantastic Film Festival","release_date":"2025-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
