A close friend, filmmaker Adrian Goycoolea reflects on Sogo’s life and legacy, framing the film as a reply to the final email he received from him.  Drawing from personal archives, interviews, and memory, the film assembles a collage of Sogo’s art and presence: radiant, restless, and unresolved. Contributors include Jonas Mekas, Bruce McClure, Raha Raissnia, Julius Ziz, Ed Halter, Andy Lampert, and members of Sogo’s family, offering perspectives on his talent, struggles, and influence.  Scored by Joe Watson of Stereolab, \"A Mixtape for Stom\" is at once an elegy and an act of remembrance; a meditation on friendship and grief, and a testament to an underground legacy that continues to reverberate.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Mixtape for Stom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stom Sogo","original_name":"Stom Sogo","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/onlZje1ofVe66Osp2UhwvlRU0h7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68f90d40c1db2cbebf6093f7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302744,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrian Goycoolea","original_name":"Adrian Goycoolea","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68f90a61f61813aec04832d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5765764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Halter","original_name":"Ed Halter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68f90a2bb519adfb608059b2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Lampert","original_name":"Andrew Lampert","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/82CSy39rkc6U3dclAdvrrMBeFIe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68f90a22aa7e548187ea1e24","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce McClure","original_name":"Bruce McClure","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68f90ce44a936746669d2647","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.2896,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68f90cc0669d63402fb908f1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4895683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raha Raissnia","original_name":"Raha Raissnia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"68f90d0cfce6abeacd609499","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2308142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julius Ziz","original_name":"Julius Ziz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"68f90d18b754813245805931","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302744,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrian Goycoolea","original_name":"Adrian Goycoolea","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f90a4f86ac442986cac789","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"https://cuff32.eventive.org/schedule/6892a86b23087298014bb562","release_date":"2025-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
