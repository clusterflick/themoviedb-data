Drawn from archival films once shown in American classrooms—many focused on Native American history and U.S. civics—the works are edited blind: the video image is physically obscured, and the structure assembled entirely through sound. Guided solely by listening, each film is built through cuts of the audio tracks only, without post-production manipulation or audio treatment—resulting in a sonic collage where meaning emerges from rhythm, tone, and interruption. Only after the edit is complete is the image revealed—becoming a kind of accidental score.  The series is an inquiry into the intersections of music, noise, and pedagogy—exploring what it means to listen to history rather than watch it, and how sonic reassembly might unsettle the visual authority of mid century educational media.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Focus and Sound","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4037511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcella Kwe","original_name":"Marcella Kwe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f9025efff8ae9b674830f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"https://www.lightmatterfilmfestival.com/program-2-2025","release_date":"2025-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
