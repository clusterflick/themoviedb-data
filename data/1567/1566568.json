Between them, they’ve survived a stroke, cancer, a life-changing house fire, and finishing dead last in the 2023 race. They’re not professional runners. They’re people who’ve been knocked down and decided to keep moving. This isn’t a story about running fast. It’s a story about getting there at all.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/n6ki2fvGv95cejmuTjkYsUKrNp4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"26.2","title":"26.2","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5764354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"LaDawn Jefferson","original_name":"LaDawn Jefferson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68f82ba8c78a975205cac356","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5764355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel Kaufman","original_name":"Joel Kaufman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68f82bb0af588915afd3b879","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5764356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Pye","original_name":"Johnny Pye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68f82bbb07a2c1b1819d2275","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5764357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaquille Roberts","original_name":"Shaquille Roberts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68f82bc5c6c6e0092d8053e0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2367842,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Heller","original_name":"Nicolas Heller","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f82bdf27085d5e4c80545d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3516996,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joshua Charow","original_name":"Joshua Charow","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/aYHOKWg4l0KbYRHa8An0988T5Qe.jpg","credit_id":"68f82bedfce6abeacd609011","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1954781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clark Slater","original_name":"Clark Slater","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f82bfb3cdadbbb70482dac","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5764360,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Berman","original_name":"Robert Berman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f82c0fa92f61793dd3b800","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5764361,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrew Bloch","original_name":"Andrew Bloch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f82c27b5c6aabb37cac313","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1570,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n6ki2fvGv95cejmuTjkYsUKrNp4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1042}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
