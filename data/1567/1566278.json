Through rehearsals, spontaneous conversations, and shared pauses in dressing rooms and city spaces, it captures the emotional and physical intensity of artistic work, the essence of youth, and the strength of human connection, alongside the desires and uncertainties they face. It is an intimate portrait, immersed in the everyday rhythm of creation and life, torn between passion and weariness, staying and leaving.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1JRWNKlFmIWGPSXe0jECYXVvJxX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Post
