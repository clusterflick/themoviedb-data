Determined to unravel the anomaly, he attempts to communicate with his younger self, but there's a catch: the connection is one-way. While Albert's voice reaches the past, his younger self remains unheard-his only responses appearing in the pages of an old journal. As Albert deciphers the cryptic messages, he realizes the stakes are far greater than he imagined. Has he been guiding his own fate all along, or is something else manipulating time itself?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":277965,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ofis Creative","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2025-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echoes of Time","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3775815,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Serhat Doğantekin","original_name":"Serhat Doğantekin","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f873f17000e1c1f4b905cc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3775815,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Serhat Doğantekin","original_name":"Serhat Doğantekin","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f873f903024794c2dbc346","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36151407","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
