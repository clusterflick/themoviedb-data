Through experimentation, the participants were able to paint directly onto the 16mm film, creating possibilities, freedom of thought and construction, thus generating a collective film full of feelings. The film also features the Rio Negro and its tributaries, which magically bathe the city of Manaus, which in the Manaós language means “Mother of the Gods”. All hail the magic of cinema.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Intercessões","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5765795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Direcao Coletiva","original_name":"Direcao Coletiva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f90e4c9555367e644831e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"https://www.lightmatterfilmfestival.com/copy-of-program-7-2025","release_date":"2025-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
