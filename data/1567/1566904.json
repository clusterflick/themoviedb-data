Together, we collected our urine and shared it in one pot. We boiled it down and watched the water evaporate until the dark brown minerals started to accumulate at the bottom. Boiling the piss is a process film considering the values embedded in bodies through a shared metabolic conversion of waste. It follows my artistic investigation into researching urine as a photographic developer and/or possibly a fixer too.  The negative film was developed with the traditional developer D96, while positive was printed with the urine-based developer. The film also contains a chemigram which combines the leftover materials transformed with the urine liquid inviting a viewer into the metabolizing processes. The sound was added in 2024 during the residency at SOLU/Bioart Society, Helsinki, as a site specific reverse recording of their toilet.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Boiling the Piss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5765728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michaela Davidova","original_name":"Michaela Davidova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f904d6c1d1cf55884831b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
