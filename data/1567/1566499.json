The tip itself is the longest (about 40 km) freshwater sand spit in the world and is the last remaining wilderness in southern Ontario. Long Point is also designated as a Globally Important Bird Area (395 species). Because of its remote location in the middle of Lake Erie, weather and waves are constantly shaping and reshaping this landscape.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bird House: Life at Canada’s Most Remote Ornithology Station","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
