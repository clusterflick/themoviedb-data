It's the materials we make them with that turn \"stuff\" into art. In the Material World we discover the cutting edge of materials science as we follow artist and engineer Zoe Laughlin and composer Tod Machover as they create and dramatically perform with a new instrument, a glass cymbal. Celebrated artist Nick Cave shows how found objects can be combined to create astonishing sculptures. World renowned designer Iris van Herpen transforms banana leaves into fabric for the haute couture runway. And artist Danny Rozin creates dazzling interactive displays which mimic human gesture and form.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Confluence: Material World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32852005","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
