For the first time ever, Gobo journeys to the human world — or, as the Fraggles refer to it: Outer Space — to find some unexpected musical inspiration. And in another first, back at the Gorgs’ castle, Junior is overwhelmed by the arrival of a new baby Gorg joining the family. This holiday season, the Fraggles and Gorgs learn that beautiful moments aren’t always perfect — but they can be as unique and memorable as snowflakes.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6254,"logo_path":"/dHfP8fUyykmTsMXbtXO0kSsYz5E.png","name":"The Jim Henson
