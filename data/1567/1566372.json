Wright Mills, the impact of the 1960s, resurgent conformity since Reagan, and the 'planned obsolescence of thinking' in anti-intellectual American culture. Along the way we learn of the experiences and influences that formed Jacoby's heretical stances. This documentary enables viewers to visit one of the most interesting intellectual figures of our time, much like earlier films on Noam Chomsky, Slavoj Zizek, and Jacques Derrida.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Velvet Prisons: Russell Jacoby on American Academia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5763589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Jacobsen","original_name":"Kurt Jacobsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68f7bc58f5d8482980817949","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487761,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Warren Leming","original_name":"Warren Leming","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68f7bc77218d1631b7861fc2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487761,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Warren Leming","original_name":"Warren Leming","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f7bceec143305581008784","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4660287,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kurt Jacobsen","original_name":"Kurt Jacobsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f7bd0bf4302438bd3bd5ad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2070707","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
