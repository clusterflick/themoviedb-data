This history has created a richness in the club and dance scene that continues today. Three local (and national / international) DJs, Blesstonio, Miss Twink USA and Nanoos, speak about their experiences being queer DJs of color in the city, what it means to hold space for the community and the difficulties they face doing this.  To Make Our People Dance explores the beauty in the queer club scene that has always been there, but has often been overlooked by prejudices of party culture. Safe spaces to dance are crucial for people, particularly marginalized, to feel a sense of liberation in a world that continues to be violent towards them.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In this documentary, three DJs explore their practice, queerness, identity, and relation to Chicago's underground and club scenes.","title":"To Make Our People Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5763290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Robles-Levine","original_name":"Antonio Robles-Levine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68f79d37e6da83976ff5c83a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5763291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Bartekian","original_name":"Nancy Bartekian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68f79d590853aaa020f5c859","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5763293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Del Hale","original_name":"Del Hale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68f79d6a8d3b3c05053a3ba4","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32359034","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
