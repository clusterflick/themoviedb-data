The video takes a playful twist on this idea, by splitting the phallic object with a reciprocating saw, and opening it up, only to reveal its multiple layers: at first it starts to resemble a vagina, but in the end hides another phallic shape inside. It thus serves as a reminder of the anatomy invested with fantasies, of the anatomy as a radical contingency and of our discomforting and ambiguous corporeality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Split","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5765708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zorica Čolić","original_name":"Zorica Čolić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f90364aa6c42804780578b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"https://www.lightmatterfilmfestival.com/program-3-2025","release_date":"2025-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
