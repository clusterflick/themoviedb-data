Cruising amongst gravestones engraved with references to queer culture and sexuality, queers defy death by devouring candy-coated blossoms.  The queer epitaphs in \"Leather Graves\" were created with an in-camera double exposure technique using a Bolex camera and a matte-box.  The cast and crew are all trans, nonbinary, gender nonconforming, and/or femme queer people.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Leather Graves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malic Amalya","original_name":"Malic Amalya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f905c128bd644df1cac633","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"https://www.lightmatterfilmfestival.com/program-3-2025","release_date":"2025-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
