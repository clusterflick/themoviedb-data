All effects and audio in this work were generated by means analog synthesis tools, whose input/output methodology I have argued is impertinently queer because of the reactivity of the medium. The work is concerned with queer/kink theory, leather culture, and is part of an ongoing series of conversations and works made between d'Andriole, Monir, and other trans people in Michigan on the role of sex and violence in trans becoming as minoritized victims of transphobia, transmisogyny, and other violence's within the American empire.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Carta Monir BDSM Film Club","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5358343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorelei d’Andriole","original_name":"Lorelei d’Andriole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f90451669d63402fb908e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
