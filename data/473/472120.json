The film follows 4 of them as they travel incredible distances to witness the last total eclipse of the millennium as it sweeps eastward across Europe to India. At various points along the way enthusiasts Alain Cirou in France, Paul Houde in Austria, Olivier Staiger in Germany and Debasis Sarkar in India offer their impressions of the historic event.","popularity":0.2958,"poster_path":"/tMbmbHONvPa1g32Sq73zwNMsNkC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2000-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadow Chasers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1875410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Cirou","original_name":"Alain Cirou","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/dDo92ulGRv7oOjoDmUxm14oFaps.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"599de87892514148d1000b5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1875411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivier Staiger","original_name":"Olivier Staiger","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"599de886c3a3687d99000a69","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1875413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debasis Sarkar","original_name":"Debasis Sarkar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"599de8d192514148d1000bcc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1593325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Arsenault","original_name":"Madeleine Arsenault","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":"/7ByQZIeuLqdxGu2WGYbIv93vjCz.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"599de8df92514148d1000bde","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":574834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hyndman","original_name":"James Hyndman","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/j82zTlwKxylV3qHCtycJ09epeU9.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"599de8ef92514148f5000bc8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Houde","original_name":"Paul Houde","popularity":0.2828,"profile_path":"/hej7SmJJL8YuGOM4yyYtCeiSZ46.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65e48e6dfe077a01620f362c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1332913,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cathy Gulkin","original_name":"Cathy Gulkin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599de844c3a3687de4000c3b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1875406,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean Marc Larivière","original_name":"Jean Marc Larivière","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599de79892514148f5000a37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1875406,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean Marc Larivière","original_name":"Jean Marc Larivière","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599de82ac3a3687d990009ff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69366,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirk Tougas","original_name":"Kirk Tougas","popularity":0.154,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599de85b9251414926000b11","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wJCzWbY7tgcZx9uNHl9mRtJg5Wx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pqfilPoyjktvH4S76S4RBNYWhyZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tMbmbHONvPa1g32Sq73zwNMsNkC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uumK4qRlpGnbSztBzTckqFfjxjn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qkIK4xfGJZL9ZC1LJkkQQgx61t8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2642,"name":"solar eclipse"},{"id":9882,"name":"space"},{"id":160330,"name":"astronomy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
