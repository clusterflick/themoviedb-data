The original novel is a twisted romance set in 1950s post-war Japan. Etsuko, a widowed society woman falls in love with her servant Saburo, a rural farm boy, but her desire drives them both to tragedy. In collaboration with Alex Segade, Tsang’s stripped down adaptation is set in a single room of an iconic hotel in Mexico City. A writer and director struggle to relate through the creative process, while on-screen as Etsuko and Saburo, they shift in and out of mutable characters. In this experimental narrative, the liminal space between reality and fantasy for the performer becomes fluid and the separation between observer and observed starts to collapse.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/hJvm0ZUVeyLhrGbXuZOkq7YNu4p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mishima in Mexico","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1876279,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alex Segade","original_name":"Alex Segade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599f286992514144df000c4b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1144951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wu Tsang","original_name":"Wu Tsang","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/7Pfn74TakjhNe87VOK0I91vpVbe.jpg","credit_id":"599f2877c3a3680596000d65","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1144951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wu Tsang","original_name":"Wu Tsang","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/7Pfn74TakjhNe87VOK0I91vpVbe.jpg","credit_id":"599f2886c3a3680607000c07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hJvm0ZUVeyLhrGbXuZOkq7YNu4p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":725}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
