Robert Vas escaped from his homeland after the brutal crushing of the 1956 Hungarian Uprising by the Russians and he was never able to return. He portrays his country through the writings of Hungary's national poets and illustrates the film with images of the Revolution and of the society it would become in the years immediately following 1956. The film was transmitted on the 20th anniversary of the crushing of the uprising.","popularity":0.4851,"poster_path":"/dyTVUZ88n6DkNB5S7irdSrMrCh2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1976-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Homeland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Bryant","original_name":"Michael Bryant","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/ytSwr1kt43fIFPIXzW7q3UuFeAu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Reader","credit_id":"59a08dda925141779a019bd3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judi Dench","original_name":"Judi Dench","popularity":1.3025,"profile_path":"/cpna5VGvAxuKuC31xJPBKy9zbnv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Reader","credit_id":"59a08de1c3a368483001903e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Vas","original_name":"Robert Vas","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/7CS7BOn3wod5ETVYDTjMVVAWkty.jpg","credit_id":"59a08dec925141774f0192cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Vas","original_name":"Robert Vas","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/7CS7BOn3wod5ETVYDTjMVVAWkty.jpg","credit_id":"59a08df6c3a368481e0199e5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barrie Gavin","original_name":"Barrie Gavin","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/vd9FnvkRUcz5HXY13kX6eLCuajv.jpg","credit_id":"59a08e00c3a368480e01855e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596223,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Béla Bartók","original_name":"Béla Bartók","popularity":0.1165,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a08e08c3a368481e0199f8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877094,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zoltán Kodály","original_name":"Zoltán Kodály","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a08e18c3a3684830019085","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877096,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"David Prosser","original_name":"David Prosser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a08e499251417793019ec0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1401826,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dave King","original_name":"Dave King","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a08e6dc3a36847e5018ad2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877097,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ron Crabb","original_name":"Ron Crabb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a08e78c3a368480e0185dd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877098,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dave Simpson","original_name":"Dave Simpson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a08e83c3a36847c501afae","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877100,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elizabeth Sussex","original_name":"Elizabeth Sussex","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a08e8f9251417793019f0a","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3381920","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1622,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dyTVUZ88n6DkNB5S7irdSrMrCh2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1081}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1976-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
