Centred on Bangladesh’s navigation of these two historic meetings, as well as its fight for United Nations recognition (vetoed by China, acting as a proxy for Pakistan), the film considers the erosion of the idea of the Third World as a potential space for decolonialism, liberation theology and socialism. In particular, it looks at how a transnational Islamic ‘ummah’ concept was used against socialist forces.","popularity":0.3162,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Meetings and a Funeral","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vijay Prashad","original_name":"Vijay Prashad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"59a1c5e7c3a368483002debc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samia Zennadi","original_name":"Samia Zennadi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"59a1c60e925141779f02ece7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zonayed Saki","original_name":"Zonayed Saki","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"59a1c626925141779302fa5c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fidel Castro","original_name":"Fidel Castro","popularity":0.5216,"profile_path":"/dX5ZWCkwCzA9YfNALghFNPlRefp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59a1c634925141779a02f5dc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasser Arafat","original_name":"Yasser Arafat","popularity":0.1266,"profile_path":"/x80kKN9Z5AsEk4NjNHxZWAJSBV5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"59a1c641925141774b030912","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1852458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Indira Gandhi","original_name":"Indira Gandhi","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/uJqH9WjBZQHJLHstUhKCQ0S1jHw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"59a1c64dc3a36847c5031b8f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1877562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anwar Sadat","original_name":"Anwar Sadat","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"59a1c65bc3a36847c5031b9d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amirul Islam","original_name":"Amirul Islam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"59a1d56592514177930306be","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atef Berredjem","original_name":"Atef Berredjem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"59a1d579c3a368481e02fc5a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1070331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muammar Gaddafi","original_name":"Muammar Gaddafi","popularity":0.2993,"profile_path":"/qrAKZnLYteDvg8BP5fn2CgjcLR6.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5de24779c51acd0011f7cca4","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naeem Mohaiemen","original_name":"Naeem Mohaiemen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a1c71492514177a702ecea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877587,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Qasim Ali Naqvi","original_name":"Qasim Ali Naqvi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a1d80dc3a368483002ec8a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
