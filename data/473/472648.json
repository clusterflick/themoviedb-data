Common in Jim Crow South, few women spoke up in fear for their lives. Not Recy Taylor, who bravely identified her rapists. The NAACP sent its chief rape investigator Rosa Parks, who rallied support and triggered an unprecedented outcry for justice. The film exposes a legacy of physical abuse of black women and reveals Rosa Parks’ intimate role in Recy Taylor’s story.","popularity":1.2069,"poster_path":"/uu143OjYA28w6sq2RVVemVwnTcF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152942,"logo_path":null,"name":"Augusta Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":88576,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transform Films","origin_country":""},{"id":66478,"logo_path":"/u7WmMkfo9MqsqfD5cuDAbd0u1qY.png","name":"Artemis Rising","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8473,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matador Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She spoke up","title":"The Rape of Recy Taylor","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2091874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Bernardi","original_name":"Tommy Bernardi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/E3AmuXQfoqN1EaF2tQ7xCe9q9z.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Billy Howerton","credit_id":"5b58613c9251416dc204b9f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1765068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia Erivo","original_name":"Cynthia Erivo","popularity":1.7579,"profile_path":"/oQcFwHu50upW6Soz4Ycc9iHge1k.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rosa Parks","credit_id":"5b58614dc3a3685c82051f14","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amy Tiemann","original_name":"Amy Tiemann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607e0d899f37b000406e4a1b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3059841,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claire L.
