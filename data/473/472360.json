Her interviews go beyond the “little deaths” of the title, seamlessly moving between issues of sexual violence, political protest, love, family, and mortality. In a culture where sexual taboos run deep, what the women of Little Deaths have in common is a belief in liberation and self-discovery through sexuality, and a remarkable courage in the face of tragedy and oppression.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/40kPzrqa8MKoflMV3YCGWgmJylU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2013-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":286,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las muertes chiquitas","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Little Deaths","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1876007,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mireia Sallarés","original_name":"Mireia Sallarés","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599ed246c3a3685a2200fe83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1876007,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mireia Sallarés","original_name":"Mireia Sallarés","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599ed2599251411008011018","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1876007,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mireia Sallarés","original_name":"Mireia Sallarés","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599ed24e9251411017010f08","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1876007,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mireia Sallarés","original_name":"Mireia Sallarés","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599ed25f9251411037011c79","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3557346","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/40kPzrqa8MKoflMV3YCGWgmJylU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
