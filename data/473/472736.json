It tells the story of Rachel Paige, an aspiring young actress, and Ed Norman, publisher of a small newspaper.  They were going to church every week and living their lives like most normal Christians.  But on one particular Sunday, something happened.  As a result of that event, both of their lives were drastically changed and a life of truly following Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior took on a whole new reality.","popularity":0.1405,"poster_path":"/pslmfRuJZPg6CQGBIG1fXwgzNa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89185,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ken Anderson Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The classic dramatic film based on the famous book","title":"In His Steps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheryl Lee Morrison","original_name":"Cheryl Lee Morrison","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rachel Paige","credit_id":"59a28764c3a368483003b7e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russ Reed","original_name":"Russ Reed","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Pastor Maxwell","credit_id":"59a28792c3a368480e03a753","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Elders","original_name":"Harry Elders","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ed Norman","credit_id":"59a287c2925141778103c74b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4433573,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"S.
