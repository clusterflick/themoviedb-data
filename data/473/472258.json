But once the past is a masked man with a meat cleaver it's easier said than done. Meanwhile, the metal band Malum arrives at the rock club Perrong 23, with mixed feelings, for their first play on a tour. The mystery seals when their roads are crossed, in an orgy of blood and violent chaos. Who is the masked man? What is he looking for? And why does he kill anyone who comes in his way?","popularity":0.0555,"poster_path":"/sJUnlhfiSfZTYc3V5dQZ9ZNQDQc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dustbin
