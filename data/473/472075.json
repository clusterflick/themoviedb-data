Don Jose, the hero of the famous book by Prosper Merimee, and Bizet's celebrated opera, was born in the Basque Provinces of Spain. He was a young, good-looking peasant, devoted to his old mother, and greatly in love with his pretty sweetheart, Mercedes. The plans of Jose and Mercedes for an early marriage were rudely dissipated by the news that the young man had been drafted for service in the Spanish army. Jose comforted his mother and Mercedes, telling them that he would soon return and they would never be separated again.","popularity":0.2111,"poster_path":"/sTnScikIk3tRcVr6KyT2J3I75Kw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carmen","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1157005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Snow","original_name":"Marguerite Snow","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/tm1mSAwwNnFh7pjPUaz1Hfg2lEc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Carmen","credit_id":"599c88ab9251411f510048af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Garwood","original_name":"William Garwood","popularity":0.1989,"profile_path":"/sFq3FeCnxyEbbNkfnueRbZLDyD8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Don José","credit_id":"599c88b29251411efd004766","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Russell","original_name":"William Russell","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/aX8jIPumedzNkhgtrCo02XmQtiu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Escamillo, the Toreador","credit_id":"599c88d3c3a368282c00414d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":559680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francelia Billington","original_name":"Francelia Billington","popularity":0.235,"profile_path":"/273n4j88dNdgCLNWebxF67TfDWz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Don José's Sweetheart, Micaëla","credit_id":"599c88dac3a3682892004465","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1650087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burton Law","original_name":"Burton Law","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"599c88e0c3a368282c004170","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1472412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Darnell","original_name":"Jean Darnell","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"599c88e59251411ef8004844","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1874751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggie Reid","original_name":"Peggie Reid","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mercedes","credit_id":"599c88f6c3a368285e004776","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148059,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Prosper Mérimée","original_name":"Prosper Mérimée","popularity":0.0987,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f2f82a3009aa001b9e7580","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucius Henderson","original_name":"Lucius Henderson","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/jqX1Bxdkhm4gFWKPeEj9pyETHGk.jpg","credit_id":"599c88929251411f0c004635","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148059,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Prosper Mérimée","original_name":"Prosper Mérimée","popularity":0.0987,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599c889b9251411f2e00465d","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0495967","wikidata_id":"Q3660281","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9pfwidnoGoWhlK84aGamNCvMqAk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sTnScikIk3tRcVr6KyT2J3I75Kw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
