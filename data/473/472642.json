Society is sustained by a class of top achievers; meanwhile, so-called minimum recipients live under sedation in Fortresses of Sleep. The great majority of top achievers view themselves as happy. An outsourced agency has been established for the rest: Life Guidance is charged with turning these individuals into optimal people as well. Alexander has internalized the system but one wrong word to his child triggers Life Guidance. He starts to rebel and encounters the horror of the system in all its brightness and affability.","popularity":0.2254,"poster_path":"/A2s8T36WnjH5bN0WOGkiok6qbCe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20693,"logo_path":null,"name":"KGP Kranzelbinder Gabriele
