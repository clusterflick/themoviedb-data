After his release from a mental institution, Sagawa returned to Japan, and later appeared in innumerable documentaries and sexploitation films. In contrast to earlier journalistic documentaries on Sagawa, the film suspends moral judgment and explores a realm that eludes classification as either “documentary” or “pure fiction,” to instead chart the ambiguous territory between crime, fantasy, and social realities, between an individual and the economy of his public persona.","popularity":0.1105,"poster_path":"/h5QOKdOnvCz6nI31EX81SGiW5nH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Commensal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Issei Sagawa","original_name":"佐川一政","popularity":0.3603,"profile_path":"/2GSVWy8O3mbWhO34izyXNByG23i.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"59a1cdcb925141774f02ecbf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1081448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Véréna Paravel","original_name":"Véréna Paravel","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/tqLPqwoZswXjvdBjX2L1XOK9pxR.jpg","credit_id":"59a1cd5cc3a36847f602efb7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucien Castaing-Taylor","original_name":"Lucien Castaing-Taylor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bzT1XTej07ZVXtW8PGfZXQFrA9f.jpg","credit_id":"59a1cd6c9251417793030205","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h5QOKdOnvCz6nI31EX81SGiW5nH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Documenta 14","release_date":"2017-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
