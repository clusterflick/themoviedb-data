In a world without humans, machines start to think uniformally, as one single big mind. What if one machine tries to implement and create a better way of thinking in their mind's algorithm ?\r Through this little short movie, using a lot of visual symbolism, we are witnessing the creation of a singular mind, through different steps of cousciousness.\r Finally, when the creation was done, the ultimate intelligence the machines have built is the most marvelous one, the human mind.  Through this artificial intelligence interpretation, questionning his danger and his limits, I wanted to show the importance of thinking by yourself. I think, in the quest of \"life's meaning\", diversity, curiosity and singularity are the keys to find it. Those are our marvelous gifts among other machines.","popularity":0.0995,"poster_path":"/i38s31TvWtctEBWgMaRIi2RFhGk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marvelous Machines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1875090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niels Prayer","original_name":"Niels Prayer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599d71fc9251411efd01cce2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":797,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i38s31TvWtctEBWgMaRIi2RFhGk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
