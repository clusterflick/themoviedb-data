In this program, Barney, Guggenheim curator Nancy Spector, and others deconstruct the Cycle’s filming and subsequent translation into sculptural installations. The locations, characters, and symbols that organize the Cycle films; the Cycle installations as spatial content carriers and extensions of the performances; and objectification of the body and undifferentiated sexuality are addressed, as are the intricacies of costuming, makeup, and sculpting with Barney’s signature materials: plastic, metal, and Vaseline.","popularity":0.0913,"poster_path":"/fA6tvlNtOJ4c8ds6ouGEgLs5pdl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Body as Matrix: Matthew Barney's Cremaster Cycle","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Barney","original_name":"Matthew Barney","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/d7huIJFX311Q5RiSTgjDvo6FNqy.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59a36de5c3a368478f049f68","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1878145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Maria Tapeiner","original_name":"Anna Maria Tapeiner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a36dfbc3a368227b006bad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fA6tvlNtOJ4c8ds6ouGEgLs5pdl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://www.ufer.co.jp/works/matrix/english.html","release_date":"2002-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
