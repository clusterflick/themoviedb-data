Based on Annelie’s diary entries, her story was to be the starting point for a kind of all-German ‘Heimatfilm’ that praises the utopian power of the GDR and sharply condemns Federal German wrongs, but finds transcendent beauty on both sides of the wall. Over the course of production, however, the visionary dimension of the project was progressively trimmed down, though it’s still tangible everywhere in the compromised final version. The intensity of its pathos is both oppressive and enchanting; some historical simplifications and ideological twists and bends may be hair-raising, but they still achieve the desired effect.","popularity":0.14,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1969-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diary of a German Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1420555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annelie Thorndike","original_name":"Annelie Thorndike","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/77WWC0G6ZPsuZ2BA9iuaKzkrxNf.jpg","credit_id":"63a3313ebcf8c9009147145c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3840153,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ernst Oeltze","original_name":"Ernst Oeltze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a33155ad87f7007c00ba0c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22765,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hans-Joachim Funk","original_name":"Hans-Joachim Funk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a33165be6d880084ed9b99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1621513,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christian Lehmann","original_name":"Christian Lehmann","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a3314fbe6d8800d9ce74e8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1511770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Englberger","original_name":"Michael Englberger","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a3315e8ddc3414e9c120d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3840181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Joachim Manfred","original_name":"Hans Joachim Manfred","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a33175ad87f7008c3dc516","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3840179,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hermann Ihde","original_name":"Hermann Ihde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a33147bcf8c900805c1ea2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3385617,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Manfred Krause","original_name":"Manfred Krause","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a3316dbcf8c9009147146e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420554,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Thorndike","original_name":"Andrew Thorndike","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/vLvq5Ua1Jozz35Zi784w2JB8v4B.jpg","credit_id":"59a4ac9892514156f10003dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1420555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annelie Thorndike","original_name":"Annelie Thorndike","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/77WWC0G6ZPsuZ2BA9iuaKzkrxNf.jpg","credit_id":"59a4ac82c3a368517d000441","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0381151","wikidata_id":"Q5310106","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1969-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
