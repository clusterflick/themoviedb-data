Despite efforts by those around them to keep the two apart, including Billy's past love Lisa (Christina Storm), they appear to be destined for one another. Their happiness is suddenly cut short when a scientist researching a treatment for HIV/AIDS accidentally discovers a serum that will allow vampires to walk in the daylight with humans. This leads to an all-out war between vampires; those who are against the serum and those who would use it to leave the shadows of night, including vicious upstart vampire Borlak (David James) who will stop at nothing to obtain it. Billy and police detective Joe Kau must now work together to protect Jenny and her family, and to keep this discovery from those who would use it against all of humanity","popularity":0.6083,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2010-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eternity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1152370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andre Frauenstein","original_name":"Andre Frauenstein","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"52fe4de99251416c751452dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rikki Brest","original_name":"Rikki Brest","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jenny","credit_id":"52fe4de99251416c751452e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":204210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hlomla Dandala","original_name":"Hlomla Dandala","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Detective Joe Kau","credit_id":"52fe4de99251416c751452e5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2203120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David James","original_name":"David James","popularity":0.2562,"profile_path":"/rqZopaTxXJCXiFcZ6TETE8b94wI.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Borlak","credit_id":"5c25758d0e0a263e1e0af574","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Storm","original_name":"Christina Storm","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"52fe4de99251416c751452ed","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Roberts","original_name":"Ian Roberts","popularity":0.3648,"profile_path":"/cQdZr5Qom4M0cQgoChtXaJ460Hn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Professor Tevis Shapiro","credit_id":"52fe4de99251416c751452f1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1165981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brümilda van Rensburg","original_name":"Brümilda van Rensburg","popularity":0.1511,"profile_path":"/9urqsB9HXi9uZNMfM0SXhHyzLab.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lilian Shapiro","credit_id":"52fe4de99251416c751452f5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gys de Villiers","original_name":"Gys de Villiers","popularity":0.2249,"profile_path":"/saIe2KMwwssTLnoghRdYlsLv6m0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Constantine","credit_id":"52fe4de99251416c751452f9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacky Kwan Tai Ho","original_name":"Jacky Kwan Tai Ho","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jackie","credit_id":"52fe4de99251416c751452fd","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher-Lee dos Santos","original_name":"Christopher-Lee dos Santos","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de99251416c75145309","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1153572,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anton Ernst","original_name":"Anton Ernst","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de99251416c75145303","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3133,"name":"vampire"},{"id":3644,"name":"south africa"},{"id":9823,"name":"rivalry"},{"id":10053,"name":"sexploitation"},{"id":3628,"name":"daywalker"},{"id":15167,"name":"police detective"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"13V","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Eternity - Vampire Movie - Official Trailer.mp4","key":"u3wWXlZQeFo","published_at":"2012-03-07T15:55:00.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec71cc3a368544800b311"}]}}}
