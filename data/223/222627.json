Cleggert is informed that in order to inherit a large inheritance, he must marry by his twenty-fifth birthday-- otherwise he would relinquish all claims to his impending fortune. Jerry soon meets his ideal would-be bride Agatha Fairhaven and the two immediately fall in love. Complications arise when Jerry's cousin, the dastardly lawyer Reginald Maltravers claims Agatha as his own. The courting couple suffer a series of mishaps on the way to altar; they are waylaid en route by a trio of bandits, escape from a runaway taxi cab, and outrun a mob of unscrupulous state authorities.","popularity":0.7287,"poster_path":"/mfoJIu3v9REpmmoVUanx4GDRvc0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28230,"logo_path":null,"name":"DeMille Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cruise of the Jasper B","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rod La Rocque","original_name":"Rod La Rocque","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/7cmambpDRIRDQmIXPbLszOypbYr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jerry Cleggett","credit_id":"52fe4df69251416c75146d11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mildred Harris","original_name":"Mildred Harris","popularity":0.1541,"profile_path":"/2yID8kVxUmaldDBGzSV83gzsqKp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Agatha Fairhaven","credit_id":"52fe4df69251416c75146d15","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Snitz Edwards","original_name":"Snitz Edwards","popularity":0.1314,"profile_path":"/hZzvzPNMoo9FhvBTURdsuMKY1fR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Reginald Maltravers","credit_id":"52fe4df69251416c75146d19","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":189673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Ackroyd","original_name":"Jack Ackroyd","popularity":0.0758,"profile_path":"/hqwVMD3xhtasPRrFsXTBnQ8QLAg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Wiggins","credit_id":"52fe4df69251416c75146d1d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Lederer","original_name":"Otto Lederer","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":"/gGgM7wZZbc2wiuUz9uisrnaf3Iy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Auctioneer","credit_id":"52fe4df69251416c75146d21","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James T.
