In order to prove to her dad that she can handle the job, she disguises herself as an ordinary \"working girl\" and gets a job in her dad's plant. There she meets and falls in love with a clerk. She brings the young man home to meet her folks, but during the evening the family safe is robbed, and all signs point to her new boyfriend.","popularity":0.4266,"poster_path":"/lvoYbOSy4yHy9VgRzyRdpra3ima.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chesterfield Motion Pictures Corporation (I)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adorable Cheat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lila Lee","original_name":"Lila Lee","popularity":0.2627,"profile_path":"/2AiD7dau2Fhu8bE7x7vthdu9Ism.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marion Dorsey","credit_id":"52fe4dfa9251416c75147619","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cornelius Keefe","original_name":"Cornelius Keefe","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/cYxipt96EOgaH7qAWje3ydshI94.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"George Mason","credit_id":"52fe4dfa9251416c7514761d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burr McIntosh","original_name":"Burr McIntosh","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/aAiQ4cm9FRd4NTPTs2xNLdJZWLe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cyrus Dorsey","credit_id":"52fe4dfa9251416c75147621","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reginald Sheffield","original_name":"Reginald Sheffield","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/2vdJFsjZJxXs0QBdH21HG3wShWf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Will Dorsey","credit_id":"52fe4dfa9251416c75147625","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladden James","original_name":"Gladden James","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":"/uW1fpWXpEo2mLneq95yO004xQNs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Howard Carter","credit_id":"52fe4dfa9251416c75147629","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Allen","original_name":"Harry Allen","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"'Dad' Mason","credit_id":"52fe4dfa9251416c7514762d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1208231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Knowland","original_name":"Alice Knowland","popularity":0.1911,"profile_path":"/c9cttIozUASDkLddBoVyOCm55xT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Mason","credit_id":"52fe4dfa9251416c75147631","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolfe Sedan","original_name":"Rolfe Sedan","popularity":0.2614,"profile_path":"/zB7AdnKPBpadzUuQUYQ877JyyXm.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Card Playing Guest","credit_id":"52fe4dfa9251416c75147639","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1360620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Lee","original_name":"Virginia Lee","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/uVcRbrap2yNu5dUZqOlJsexkUnZ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Roberta Arnold","credit_id":"547b6d7c9251412d7f0005eb","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Burton L.
