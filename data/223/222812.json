After thirty years of chasing wars and conflicts, Bernard-Henri Lévy takes us along for a journey reminiscent of Malraux and Hemingway, though retaining a style all his own. Six-months of exceptional dramaturgy. Six months of a war for freedom, resulting in the fall of one of the longest, most relentless dictatorships of modern times. A war with a beginning but perhaps no end. The making of a war.","popularity":0.2165,"poster_path":"/sAVDuowHKzU6lS4Dw9lbOjnOOtr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2670,"logo_path":null,"name":"Margo Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Oath of Tobruk","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Oath of Tobruk","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le serment de Tobrouk","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208266,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gilles Hertzog","original_name":"Gilles Hertzog","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dfc9251416c75147a89","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":411038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard-Henri Lévy","original_name":"Bernard-Henri Lévy","popularity":0.1686,"profile_path":"/qtif2EebTLcqeOvbRARhcvRVXkw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4dfc9251416c75147a83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":411038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard-Henri Lévy","original_name":"Bernard-Henri Lévy","popularity":0.1686,"profile_path":"/qtif2EebTLcqeOvbRARhcvRVXkw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4dfc9251416c75147a8f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2399531","wikidata_id":"Q3227119","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sLkuyHq7Dj8fqw6KIUKhxofUHwn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fXugZecKFlN3p44KKYRNyXDSiPn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sAVDuowHKzU6lS4Dw9lbOjnOOtr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":596}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival de Cannes","release_date":"2012-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
