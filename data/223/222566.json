Immersed for months in their community, speaking their language, she placed her camera as close as possible to their voices and gestures, offering viewers encounters of a rare intimacy. As much as the splendor of the landscapes, the extreme harshness of the living conditions or the emotion shared with these nomads, it is this closeness that creates the magic of the film.","popularity":0.3136,"poster_path":"/8e34RK3NRGXr6zTDgVqM5d0l1df.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16888,"logo_path":"/di3Bw89NYi83N769K6wYnqqSFHS.png","name":"ZED","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Nuit Nomade","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1838493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tundup","original_name":"Tundup","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Father","credit_id":"594ecae6c3a36832ad03c44a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1838494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenrap","original_name":"Kenrap","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Son","credit_id":"594ecaee925141312703c852","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1838495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toldan","original_name":"Toldan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Husband","credit_id":"594ecaf6c3a36832ca03c5b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1838496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dholma","original_name":"Dholma","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Wife","credit_id":"594ecafec3a36832ca03c5c2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1838491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Chaud","original_name":"Marianne Chaud","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lMOOEVNccGSJw200mSeVowyKixS.jpg","credit_id":"594ecaa8c3a368329b042d16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1838491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Chaud","original_name":"Marianne Chaud","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lMOOEVNccGSJw200mSeVowyKixS.jpg","credit_id":"594ecaaec3a3683265042c1b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1838491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Chaud","original_name":"Marianne Chaud","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lMOOEVNccGSJw200mSeVowyKixS.jpg","credit_id":"594ecab8c3a36832bd03c531","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":20713,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Bernet","original_name":"Olivier Bernet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594ecabf925141311103d6fa","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1838491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Chaud","original_name":"Marianne Chaud","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lMOOEVNccGSJw200mSeVowyKixS.jpg","credit_id":"594ecac7925141315503edac","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":70952,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Muriel Breton","original_name":"Muriel Breton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594ecad0c3a368323203a64c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1838492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximilian Essayie","original_name":"Maximilian Essayie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594ecadac3a368327903c6c8","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2338047","wikidata_id":"Q3211261","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/96qhFmJsP7cKewvIKWnFUrhwxpb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fqCcUjlXJZGoROr25b1rLheEfef.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8e34RK3NRGXr6zTDgVqM5d0l1df.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":486,"name":"himalaya mountain range"},{"id":208975,"name":"nomad"},{"id":236859,"name":"traditional culture"},{"id":262228,"name":"observational documentary"},{"id":301131,"name":"ethology"},{"id":309261,"name":"kharnak"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Autrans Mountain Film Festival","release_date":"2011-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
