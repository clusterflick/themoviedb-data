The presence of the child endangers the mission, leaving Indy in a moral quandary; fighting his conscience, his sense of duty, his own men and the enemy as he battles his way across the country. Depressed by the turmoil around him, Indy reaches his lowest point. Hope appears in the presence of Albert Schweitzer, a profoundly inspiring and committed doctor, philosopher and musician. Helping out at Schweitzer's jungle hospital, Indy finds his faith in humanity restored and his outlook on life forever changed in this beautiful and moving film.","popularity":1.3099,"poster_path":"/n6EL1vWY2koiDSJ71kfJxM9kIki.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7671,"logo_path":"/r7KeUsNVv0iggZRh6XmNNq2OEw1.png","name":"Amblin Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1,"logo_path":"/tlVSws0RvvtPBwViUyOFAO0vcQS.png","name":"Lucasfilm Ltd.","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones: Oganga, The Giver and Taker of Life","video":true,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Young Indiana Jones 11: Oganga på liv och död","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Indiana Jones äventyr 11: Oganga på liv och död","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Patrick Flanery","original_name":"Sean Patrick Flanery","popularity":0.9018,"profile_path":"/aHQtxIjMEDWdXqvFJplx0Kcwdn6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Indiana Jones","credit_id":"5aef9772c3a368141b00d768","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronny Coutteure","original_name":"Ronny Coutteure","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/mTcL5vzuQayOhwuLEeiJ5Ym2yl6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Remy Baudouin","credit_id":"5aef977d0e0a261d9500b041","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Pringle","original_name":"Bryan Pringle","popularity":0.3639,"profile_path":"/oOrBXDEC5NZEmCm2A9NT785Lemq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Zachariah Sloat","credit_id":"5aef978a925141768300ba4c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Duchaussoy","original_name":"Michel Duchaussoy","popularity":0.4662,"profile_path":"/5HuD9Y3hYUKgfomk93DMRS4G4pT.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Maj.
