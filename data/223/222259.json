Despite ending up homeless Cool \"Disco\" Dan used graffiti to escape the social problems D.C. had in the 1980s when things turned violent and became known as the Murder Capital of the United States. Cool \"Disco\" Dan ends up as a cult character of DC and his name becomes a symbol of survival during DC's most trying years.","popularity":0.7087,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Legend of Cool Disco Dan","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cool 'Disco' Dan","original_name":"Cool 'Disco' Dan","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d6bc4f17c44300d3890062","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Rollins","original_name":"Henry Rollins","popularity":0.8415,"profile_path":"/2E0cZdoJsdt1Lv4waG3s6fsfJeU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63d6bb2817c443009a00f2a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Barry","original_name":"Marion Barry","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d6bb4520e6a500d543feac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Brown","original_name":"Chuck Brown","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d6bb5a955c65007baa5c0d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2666315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory 'Sugar Bear' Elliott","original_name":"Gregory 'Sugar Bear' Elliott","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d6bb7b3dc313009df00afc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2730639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Big Tony Fisher","original_name":"Big Tony Fisher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d6bb9217c44300aa3fff13","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hendrickson","original_name":"Paul Hendrickson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d6bbaa22df2e00df3d8536","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andre 'Whiteboy' Johnson","original_name":"Andre 'Whiteboy' Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d6bbbe20e6a5007ffd684a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2949703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Hurwitz","original_name":"Seth Hurwitz","popularity":0.0926,"profile_path":"/yhM80wPIUpmxD0AAgbSiT6lQiuQ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d6bbd617c443008488ec42","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2679655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DC Scorpio","original_name":"DC Scorpio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d6bbf922df2e008cc8abc0","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Ski","original_name":"Frank Ski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63d6bc1312b10e0093e8388f","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alona Wartofsky","original_name":"Alona Wartofsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"63d6bc2b20e6a500890cf91e","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Pattisall","original_name":"Joseph Pattisall","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de69251416c75144d55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3118302","wikidata_id":"Q28869531","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":521,"name":"washington dc, usa"},{"id":2815,"name":"graffiti"},{"id":10764,"name":"crack cocaine"},{"id":161201,"name":"alternative medicine"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
