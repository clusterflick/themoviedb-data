We follow Piling, a young soccer fanatic, through a slum district of Manila. No ball or cleats, but a Coke can and flip-flops are the ingredients for a virtuoso demonstration of the football art. Only at the end does it become apparent why the little ball juggler will never be a Ronaldinho.","popularity":0.1454,"poster_path":"/vqMXQCCMQWShdsE7klCh8mMcEUR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmless
