Through an experimental collective creation method, the migrants can choose how to tell their stories. The film delves into each step of the process, as well as how the queer migrants carve out their space in the urban landscape they find themselves in. By narrating and shedding light on their origins, they make their identities, stories, and themselves visible to establish a sense of belonging in their new home.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/2TC1ctMj9ATsxKB2GOvnCctj7X1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5038043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Levis Owor","original_name":"Levis Owor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"672728de9e0877d1d8af88ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5038044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Davit Mariamidze","original_name":"Davit Mariamidze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"672728e7398c9043f80d134d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5038042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camila Flores-Fernández","original_name":"Camila Flores-Fernández","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672728bb398c9043f80d1332","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iqran Rasheed","original_name":"Iqran Rasheed","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672728ce398c9043f80d133e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2TC1ctMj9ATsxKB2GOvnCctj7X1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
