What are their voices, which experiences have they had, and above all: What do they wish for the future?  In an interview format, the documentary focuses on the protagonists and their individual experiences. The ensemble includes nearly 30 actors, writers, directors, and producers. By means of personal conversations, the audience gains an intense and authentic insight into the lives of those working in film. During the filming in the following year, male-diverse participants were also invited to create a multifaceted discourse.  The topics include structural and individual issues such as gender equality, power structures, female diversity, and much more. In dialogue with the participants, the documentary looks toward the future: Where are there promising approaches already, where are the opportunities for (self-)empowerment, and how can we initiate change, both individually and collectively?","popularity":0.196,"poster_path":"/RIlR7Cy3iIJFa9UJZDnsgc3hf8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nackt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1893534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Britta Steffenhagen","original_name":"Britta Steffenhagen","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/sHOYPbfh4KiKI9N3wHhiax5i9eh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"672608bb1f61a4a8e82590bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495808,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Cadenza Zhao","original_name":"Cadenza Zhao","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"672608cbac8b4819e5f055dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1830600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monika Oschek","original_name":"Monika Oschek","popularity":0.1273,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"672608d6ac8b4819e5f055e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5036526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolin Ott","original_name":"Carolin Ott","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"672609161f61a4a8e82590d9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1401924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Louisa Garde","original_name":"Laura Louisa Garde","popularity":0.1022,"profile_path":"/wijPpM5f2oLNKiQ1tYS30QH7hNR.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"672609216154748a536e48e3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1249807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uta Kargel","original_name":"Uta Kargel","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/caPCLNoQUooUn0UX3bMI3TGqdQl.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67260935ac8b4819e5f055fe","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2926576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imme Beccard","original_name":"Imme Beccard","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"672609446154748a536e48ed","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2075515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edelgard Hansen","original_name":"Edelgard Hansen","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67260957ac8b4819e5f05620","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa Loy","original_name":"Elsa Loy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726089b9d6bc295eb31e576","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3383923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Roemeth","original_name":"Anne Roemeth","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672608ad9d6bc295eb31e57a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/RIlR7Cy3iIJFa9UJZDnsgc3hf8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"58.
