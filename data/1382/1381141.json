They begin their journey with a trip to the Rocky Mountains to hunt elk and mountain lions and to fish in the freshwater lakes. They travel to Lac la Ronge in Saskatchewan and to Anchorage and the Katmai Peninsula in Alaska to fish for trout, salmon, and grayling and hunt moose and bear. In the Arctic, the hunters go with a group of Eskimos for their biggest catch, the polar bear. The hunters travel south by plane, to the Fishing Club of Panama to fish for marlin, tuna, shark, and dolphin in the Gulf of Panama. In South Africa and the Zambesi River basin, they often hunt with only a camera. Accompanied by native beaters, they hunt elephants, antelope, buffalo, crocodiles, and hippopotami. As conservationists they capture some almost extinct white rhinoceros and take them to a game preserve for protection.","popularity":0.4974,"poster_path":"/wyjCqQZkW5GO1jMG2jiOeunFX71.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":243534,"logo_path":null,"name":"WAB Motion Picture Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In Wide Screen - Full Color - 5 Years In The Making","title":"The Outdoorsman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5035231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Steinbach","original_name":"Bill Steinbach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67250a71886d5e8a5b3de791","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5035218,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Charles Beery","original_name":"Charles Beery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67250959771f5cb14955851e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5035219,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William A.
