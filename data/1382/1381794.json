Alma is telling Rina who to date (a number of eligible boys) and how to live (criticizing everything about her life) while being unaware of the secret her granddaughter carries. However, after Rina has had too much and finally reveals that she's gay, Alma understands the reason her spirit is there might go further than what she'd thought. She has a secret of her own, and maybe spending this time with Rina is a way for her to find some closure with her own past.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5037462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulina Restrepo-Ocampo","original_name":"Paulina Restrepo-Ocampo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rina","credit_id":"6726b1c8e64e360884a8b943","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1846214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Lou Simo","original_name":"Mary Lou Simo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Alma","credit_id":"6726b1e2c0bc0749d0d88004","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5037465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryanna Dunn","original_name":"Ryanna Dunn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"6726b1f7c0bc0749d0d88017","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5037468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernando Pelaez","original_name":"Fernando Pelaez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726b22757722b55717a8c88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5037474,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandra Albuquerque","original_name":"Alexandra Albuquerque","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726b25c398c9043f80d02ee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5037474,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandra Albuquerque","original_name":"Alexandra Albuquerque","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726b27ae64e360884a8b96e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5037477,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Linda Lin","original_name":"Linda Lin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726b299c0bc0749d0d8809a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3650685,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Isabel Descamps Rivera","original_name":"Isabel Descamps Rivera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726b2d929735d6a04da5ab1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5037481,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Felicia Varlotto","original_name":"Felicia Varlotto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726b30429735d6a04da5aca","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
