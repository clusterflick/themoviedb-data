It uses stock footage, dating back to the First World War, in its theme of showing how dependent modern war vehicles are on having a fuel supply source. In the First World War, Britain's sea power was preserved through the maintenance of a series of coaling stations dotting the Seven Seas. With the change to oil, rather than coal, the necessities for European nations, without home supply, are dependent on the Near-and-Far East where the pipe-lines and oil production have to be defended against attacks by the Axis powers. Canada's role in oil production is also highlighted.","popularity":0.1093,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1942-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle for Oil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorne Greene","original_name":"Lorne Greene","popularity":0.768,"profile_path":"/8thOy0TS7tNDBcwPqjmOPw9Jgdx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6724c7180df4e66d4d924fc9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2203016,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Beveridge","original_name":"James Beveridge","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724c7030df4e66d4d924fb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1298539","wikidata_id":"Q23002866","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1942-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
