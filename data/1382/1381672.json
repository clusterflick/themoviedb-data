But by definition, a \"Jolly Roger\" is the classic black pirate flag with skull and crossbones. This documentary tells the unvarnished story of the Swiss radio pirates who emerged in the 1970s. The focus is on Radio 24 in its wild years, when Schawinski's team broadcast from Italy, with the strongest FM station in the world at the time, straight down from Pizzo Groppera, 130 kilometers all the way to the Zurich area. Supported by numerous original documents from private filmmakers and from the SRG archives, the viewer relives the absurd radio war between David and Goliath that lasted almost four years, 24 years after this war between the radio pirates and the state power began on November 13, 1979. The many known and unknown fighters, who rallied behind their Radio Winkelried Schawinski in 1979 to help usher Switzerland into a new media age, remember the good and bad times, the demonstrations and the numerous threatened and actual closures.","popularity":0.4598,"poster_path":"/bJL1HOPcEZ4VYgYUz5d7BtJzn4n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147748,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mesch & Ugge AG","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2003-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jolly Roger - A chapter in Swiss media history","title":"Jolly Roger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2764716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Schawinski","original_name":"Roger Schawinski","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/7hFKdbyJcjaK3LQa621qY1DKvgZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"672660c29e0877d1d8af742d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3855683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Baumann","original_name":"Frank Baumann","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"672660cf720f0476f60d650a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5036950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ursi Spaltenstein","original_name":"Ursi Spaltenstein","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"herself","credit_id":"672660e717d78221edd886d8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2940912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Röbi Koller","original_name":"Röbi Koller","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"himself","credit_id":"672660f49e0877d1d8af7444","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3701220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dani Wyler","original_name":"Dani Wyler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"himself","credit_id":"67266102c090109580f9b70b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5036953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Gilli","original_name":"Markus Gilli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"himself","credit_id":"6726611a17d78221edd886ec","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4711102,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christian Heeb","original_name":"Christian Heeb","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"himself","credit_id":"67266125e86453169bc35eec","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150611,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Beat Hirt","original_name":"Beat Hirt","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67266137554083a56a0d48db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2540399,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Björn Lindroos","original_name":"Björn Lindroos","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726615917d78221edd88715","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5036956,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christian Müller","original_name":"Christian Müller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726618fe86453169bc35f16","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0388153","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pALFoirwKFaYycBKXZBZFBPLQQW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/bJL1HOPcEZ4VYgYUz5d7BtJzn4n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1224,"name":"radio station"},{"id":1228,"name":"1970s"},{"id":1222,"name":"zurich"},{"id":1223,"name":"switzerland"},{"id":4108,"name":"protest"},{"id":8030,"name":"pirate radio"},{"id":176794,"name":"public media"},{"id":178107,"name":"david vs. goliath"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2003-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jolly Roger Trailer - Ein Kapitel Schweizer Mediengeschichte","key":"gUPKrGATSa8","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-11-25T18:32:08.000Z","id":"6726628caff7e01c6185cad2"}]}}}
