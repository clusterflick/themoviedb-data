A salute to the women of the armed services. Women from the Los Angeles Athletic Club perform water ballet at the Beverly Wilshire pool in California. We visit the women in the armed forces, in uniform and in bathing suits. The Woman's Army Corp in Fort Devens, Massachusetts. Wave Navy girls from Hunter College, New York at the Westchester Country Club. Women of the Marine Reserve Corp, on the beaches of New River, North Carolina. WW2 landing craft bring an invasion of girls to the beach. What an invasion! I'm sure the soldiers enjoyed this WW2 film of the Homefront, a morale booster in times of war.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mermaids on Parade","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1149815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Husing","original_name":"Ted Husing","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6726f7d2c090109580f9ccbc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157557,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Eaton","original_name":"Jack Eaton","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726f7bec090109580f9ccb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2859576","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1943-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
