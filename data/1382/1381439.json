Beginning in the late 1970s and spanning her 40-year career, Comfort fused text, rhythm, and movement to craft experimental works of bold political satire and irreverent social commentary. Archival footage and contemporary interviews with Comfort, her collaborators, and dance historians shed light on an artist who defied expectations and engaged audiences through socially relevant, issue-oriented movement theater.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ue7Q4et2FHpN9LUgAtIe0V0WD5C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"breaking form","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":2748,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ue7Q4et2FHpN9LUgAtIe0V0WD5C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1965}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
