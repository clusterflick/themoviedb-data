Today its survival is threatened by extensive human activity and the construction of a dam that has disrupted the river's natural flow. The few remaining specimens are kept alive in long artificial basins submerged in the forest, far from any danger, in tranquil water. They await adulthood and being released into the murky waters of the river, at the mercy of their destiny.  VIVI shows how short-sighted policies leading to the extinction of an ancient species. It tells the collective story of young researchers and volunteers dedicated to safeguarding life, habitat, and culture, part of their territory. It contrasts the physicality of a wall that obstructs and divides with the apparently fragile but resilient nature. It does so through the eyes of the sturgeon, showing the challenges it must overcome in a corrupted habitat. It's a symphony of water, nature, and small actions that change the world.","popularity":0.1088,"poster_path":"/h2sLmq6GDi8GOLH6silX5ykcBlD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":243731,"logo_path":"/jbojtro4Q20mLq4A8Si2IaIgxiJ.png","name":"Aquarela Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"VIVI","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacopo Marzi","original_name":"Jacopo Marzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/9KDG4frAwV6Pls2PX448AJwjf3f.jpg","credit_id":"67266045554083a56a0d48a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacopo Marzi","original_name":"Jacopo Marzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/9KDG4frAwV6Pls2PX448AJwjf3f.jpg","credit_id":"67266059554083a56a0d48a9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacopo Marzi","original_name":"Jacopo Marzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/9KDG4frAwV6Pls2PX448AJwjf3f.jpg","credit_id":"67266064720f0476f60d64e3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacopo Marzi","original_name":"Jacopo Marzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/9KDG4frAwV6Pls2PX448AJwjf3f.jpg","credit_id":"6726606f720f0476f60d64eb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1543933,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emiliano Battista","original_name":"Emiliano Battista","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726609017d78221edd885d4","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3297999,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lorenzo Sattin","original_name":"Lorenzo Sattin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726609f9e0877d1d8af7416","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3297999,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lorenzo Sattin","original_name":"Lorenzo Sattin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672660aa9e0877d1d8af741e","department":"Crew","job":"Mix Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5036948,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tommaso Bullo","original_name":"Tommaso Bullo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672660c6e86453169bc35ecd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3302635,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lapo Pecchioli","original_name":"Lapo Pecchioli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672660eb720f0476f60d6522","department":"Camera","job":"Drone Cinematographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3302635,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lapo Pecchioli","original_name":"Lapo Pecchioli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726612d17d78221edd88704","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298000,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Gino Liegi","original_name":"Gino Liegi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726613817d78221edd88709","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3302635,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lapo Pecchioli","original_name":"Lapo Pecchioli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672661e0aff7e01c6185ca83","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232775,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Davide Bertuccio","original_name":"Davide Bertuccio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672661eeaff7e01c6185ca8a","department":"Camera","job":"Second Unit Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h2sLmq6GDi8GOLH6silX5ykcBlD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"VIVI - Trailer","key":"1010220453","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-09-17T13:02:51.000Z","id":"6726641d2f9816dc67f00922"}]}}}
