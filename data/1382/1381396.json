Their journey begins at kilometer marker 720, an obelisk-shaped monument located on the border with the United States, and ends at Cape Anaulirvik, north of Ivujivik, the northernmost point of the Ungava Peninsula. Over the course of a 91-day expedition, they set out to meet the country in all its immensity, splendor and impetuosity, a country that suddenly reveals itself to be less abstract, less distant, more real.","popularity":0.1653,"poster_path":"/nGeZAdZBmlK19MKPgrY4HnbGudm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101863,"logo_path":"/34ZNpURyDWc5tlUg0IouLVfr4oh.png","name":"Vital Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"North Of Ourselves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5036160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Lalande-Markon","original_name":"Samuel Lalande-Markon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"672599086dd59a9823708e56","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5036161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon-Pierre Goneau","original_name":"Simon-Pierre Goneau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6725990c5f842a0d35c5b8e4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sébastien Ricard","original_name":"Sébastien Ricard","popularity":0.2722,"profile_path":"/lBEmpTzvwbNSpSPlZaH3ypFpEQX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67259a1b82442fc3a9793ecb","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-France L’Ecuyer","original_name":"Marie-France L’Ecuyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/njcdPhb86d36EJIsAodbKpZJkY0.jpg","credit_id":"672598e36dd59a9823708e48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-France L’Ecuyer","original_name":"Marie-France L’Ecuyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/njcdPhb86d36EJIsAodbKpZJkY0.jpg","credit_id":"672598eb6dd59a9823708e4b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5036160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Lalande-Markon","original_name":"Samuel Lalande-Markon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672598fc1ba193caec2ab59a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31969570","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hMaiJnBEesBiVs5MoTus6ktPXEV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1630,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nGeZAdZBmlK19MKPgrY4HnbGudm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1100}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":175428,"name":"adventurer"},{"id":313151,"name":"premières nations"},{"id":313152,"name":"autochtones"},{"id":329255,"name":"paysage"},{"id":341289,"name":"ungava"},{"id":347307,"name":"hiver"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Cinemania 2024","release_date":"2024-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
