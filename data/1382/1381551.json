Techno and heroin, heroes and saints, comics and film, philosophy and performance. He turned himself into a subject of radical living, too close, too intense.  This documentary approaches QRT’s life and crafts an anecdotal biography through interviews with friends who look back on their shared time up to QRT’s tragic drug-related death in ‘96. Excerpts from his texts, published posthumously by Merve Verlag, are also presented.","popularity":0.156,"poster_path":"/pqXdw8a6S1kcWfm83WotOH9nm2M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"QRT: Sign, Zombie, Teqno - A Necrologue","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Leiner","original_name":"Kurt Leiner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"(archive footage)","credit_id":"673d1b4b867524e92837116e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":672,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Roehler","original_name":"Oskar Roehler","popularity":0.4715,"profile_path":"/jqAQDH19vOQU5crqqTn3OY6mWa6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"673d1b504d6db00d93d4e178","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5069899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Lamberty","original_name":"Tom Lamberty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"673d1b5f4d6db00d93d4e189","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5069902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Wulf","original_name":"Frank Wulf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"673d1b6a4d6db00d93d4e19f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28930,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Horst Markgraf","original_name":"Horst Markgraf","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"673d1b7160b7b3bc94a0dc09","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5069903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Gütinger","original_name":"Barbara Gütinger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"673d1b789034f0fd300a7f5b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5069904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krystian Krypton Kolbe","original_name":"Krystian Krypton Kolbe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"673d1b7e60b7b3bc94a0dc1a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205232,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Manuel Stettner","original_name":"Manuel Stettner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67260be3f311b7403a411028","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205232,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Manuel Stettner","original_name":"Manuel Stettner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673d1ba29034f0fd300a7f64","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2606375,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Söhngen","original_name":"Jonathan Söhngen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673d1bcf4d6db00d93d4e1ad","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/pqXdw8a6S1kcWfm83WotOH9nm2M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":905}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"58.
