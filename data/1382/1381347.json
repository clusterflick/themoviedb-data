Her mother is dead, her father has been missing since he left for war, and the orphan Midori is given to Kinnosuke and his wife, who soon have a baby together, so she is treated as an obstacle. When a female sword-play troupe comes to town, she cannot forget the kindness shown to her by female magician Katsutamusai Harue (Awashima), so she follows the troupe on their tours. Midori became a popular singer and was loved by the troupe, but only Yoshizawa (Abe), the leader of the troupe, had eyes for Midori and bullied her.","popularity":0.2843,"poster_path":"/curTHDY7m8ps4ZGdMU3Z2Wg95W0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192,"logo_path":"/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png","name":"Shochiku","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1952-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merry Migratory Birds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"陽気な渡り鳥","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Yōkina wataridori","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":945638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hibari Misora","original_name":"美空ひばり","popularity":0.4506,"profile_path":"/9dCnULSXePN46VGNiD3XMEJj7LI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67257e296ffcc3450be6de86","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatsuo Saitō","original_name":"斎藤達雄","popularity":0.4131,"profile_path":"/hcppwZ64shWhAZDyflJeo7GfXac.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67910095a7f27130bb28b48e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chikage Awashima","original_name":"淡島千景","popularity":0.698,"profile_path":"/p6CAnnLLVxk89Lsxz0oIaLpUuPR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"679100a1a7f27130bb28b496","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reikichi Kawamura","original_name":"河村黎吉","popularity":0.3212,"profile_path":"/mnGvc3fa1DuNQtiSaZQ6Dp1dFwN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"679100ac6c38059979775890","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":945630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yasushi Sasaki","original_name":"佐々木康","popularity":0.5262,"profile_path":"/cJ6WElm67w3d9AoY4rQg48qTx7v.jpg","credit_id":"67276484398c9043f80d1b06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Akira Fushimi","original_name":"伏見晁","popularity":0.1486,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6791005a550e6fc3cde007bf","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1609355,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tadashi Manjome","original_name":"万城目正","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67910080de44a2098677506a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5506360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/curTHDY7m8ps4ZGdMU3Z2Wg95W0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3PL4W1EaBSneTc55Z9tffRo5GCv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
