The textual narrative is combined with images, sounds and storylines bearing witness to more recent narratives from Vieques as well as from the northwest coast of Scotland on and near Cape Wrath, where military occupations, and local resistance implicate these distinct geographies.  This film is part of a larger body of work that addresses entangled histories of bodies, land and resistance, and seeks to engage griefwork attuned to climate and place.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Crossing (1698/2003)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3429197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilia Beatriz","original_name":"Emilia Beatriz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67251d4eba4f82cb22b05ea7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
