Three girlfriends and two men meet with different intentions and have to realize just how little they really know about each other. On the beautiful island of Mallorca, the ugly truth reveals itself. No one actually wants that, it just happens. The house of cards collapses. How much do we deceive each other? Why doesn’t anyone want to fail or admit mistakes? What, if a mother doesn’t want to be one? And what if, in the end, everything doesn’t turn out fine?","popularity":0.2077,"poster_path":"/aqaJm5Tud2gKm7zSZioHJP4UyDh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House of Cards","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1779562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Walther-Gabory","original_name":"Jessica Walther-Gabory","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/5EXejusDSatvYdqcmLSzud7hSdE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Eva","credit_id":"67252753886d5e8a5b3dedbd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1249807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uta Kargel","original_name":"Uta Kargel","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/caPCLNoQUooUn0UX3bMI3TGqdQl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Karlotta","credit_id":"672527673985f3f41ad1d8c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1840595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Krakor","original_name":"Madeleine Krakor","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mara","credit_id":"6725277945b3ede8298c784a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Knud Riepen","original_name":"Knud Riepen","popularity":0.1696,"profile_path":"/lklan6KqM5nRQI9wq9B2vR2Ol6U.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hanno","credit_id":"6725278e886d5e8a5b3dedf2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raphaël Vogt","original_name":"Raphaël Vogt","popularity":0.2247,"profile_path":"/my2yAeNICOtCABpCCWVIWwC3Rfm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Boris","credit_id":"6725279e45b3ede8298c7873","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1794839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jurij Neumann","original_name":"Jurij Neumann","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672526dc3985f3f41ad1d885","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aI3zCSDG2MpnDSCUlqnK6vXvlBP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2782,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/aqaJm5Tud2gKm7zSZioHJP4UyDh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1964}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"58.
