As he watches, the images on the screen blur and distort, merging with shadows that creep across the walls.

Detached and transfixed, he becomes lost in a hypnotic loop, questioning whether he’s watching the screen or if the screen is watching him.","popularity":0.2619,"poster_path":"/khwjmJXBgyxDZTujsELobxOgzeQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170210,"logo_path":null,"name":"N/A","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Reality blurs in the glow of the screen.","title":"DORIAN'S CONTEMPLATION ON THE CRISIS OF EXISTENCE","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5037456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fuad","original_name":"Fuad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dorian","credit_id":"6726b0662f9816dc67f014fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5037459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Farsin","original_name":"Farsin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"6726c41057722b55717a92f6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5037459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Farsin","original_name":"Farsin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726b084e64e360884a8b89d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5037459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Farsin","original_name":"Farsin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726b0992f9816dc67f01505","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5037459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Farsin","original_name":"Farsin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726b0ad29735d6a04da598c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5037459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Farsin","original_name":"Farsin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726b0c32f9816dc67f01524","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5037459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Farsin","original_name":"Farsin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726b0f6e64e360884a8b8d1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5037459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Farsin","original_name":"Farsin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6726b10cc0bc0749d0d87fcf","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"Farsinnn"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y2pE9iwbAWtBw91pMzcda1LNehL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ywPBMasVJbPYK9wucmADdSzDBhP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/khwjmJXBgyxDZTujsELobxOgzeQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2115,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dHOZ0BIlNG2N0pP64v1gGPXKIvQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1410}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3762,"name":"darkness"},{"id":194170,"name":"televison"},{"id":232440,"name":"isolationism"},{"id":256059,"name":"neo-surrealism"},{"id":333333,"name":"shadows"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"EXPÉRIMENTAL: DORIAN'S CONTEMPLATION ON THE CRISIS OF EXISTENCE","key":"E1_zgIlzZ08","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-04-13T16:05:11.000Z","id":"6726c2be9dcc2dd534743c39"}]}}}
