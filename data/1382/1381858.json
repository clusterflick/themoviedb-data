However, Edgar soon rallies and organizes a side show, displaying the greatest freaks on earth. This soon draws attention from the Bates boys, and Edgar is himself again, until that night when he camps out in the sideshow tent. Then the spooks hover about and Edgar is carried shrieking into the house by his father. This film is presumably lost.","popularity":0.3054,"poster_path":"/yWHTkuWOdr8I6g0YqN46LBwqVrk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldwyn Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edgar Camps Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1718303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Peil Jr.","original_name":"Edward Peil Jr.","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/2RqyPlsgtWAnE1SyXrBj6LCbR5Q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Edgar Pomeroy","credit_id":"6726dde65af29e88553aee36","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1738770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille Ricksen","original_name":"Lucille Ricksen","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":"/1dUh2KsaKDtPfgXWftLqdmmuI9g.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alice Littlefield","credit_id":"6726ddfc2f9816dc67f01a8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buddy Messinger","original_name":"Buddy Messinger","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":"/gUNoa7hESyMNtOtqT73iB92yAH7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Freddie Littlefield","credit_id":"6726de0b7e8fc5a821f9241d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Cogley","original_name":"Nick Cogley","popularity":0.199,"profile_path":"/lbIxmCvhMbjFDne97WFvqAv10KG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6726de23e64e360884a8beff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cossar","original_name":"John Cossar","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":"/eSNYJl4CY2nJkRO3VXY5V5hlQ3e.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6726de2fe64e360884a8bf03","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1363932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cordelia Callahan","original_name":"Cordelia Callahan","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6726de1a2f9816dc67f01a9e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4892932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Dunn","original_name":"Marie Dunn","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6726de38c0bc0749d0d8865d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935862,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kenneth Earl","original_name":"Kenneth Earl","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6726de42398c9043f80d0a5d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1638770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucretia Harris","original_name":"Lucretia Harris","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Iris","credit_id":"6726de507e8fc5a821f9246e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4892944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur H.
