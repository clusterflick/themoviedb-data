His brave effort to go barefoot \"like we do in the city\" causes him much pain, and everything he attempts to demonstrate the city's superiority has disastrous results. However, a black eye, a face full of bee-stings, and the general bawling-out of the gang fails to conquer him, and he declares that he is having a bully time. This silent comedy short is presumably lost.","popularity":0.2273,"poster_path":"/i85BHb04gQLIrzFCoJPxL6XA7FY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldwyn Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edgar's Country Cousin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1718303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Peil Jr.","original_name":"Edward Peil Jr.","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/2RqyPlsgtWAnE1SyXrBj6LCbR5Q.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Edgar Pomeroy","credit_id":"6726ef42cdead30fbdb50c5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1738770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille Ricksen","original_name":"Lucille Ricksen","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":"/1dUh2KsaKDtPfgXWftLqdmmuI9g.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alice Littlefield","credit_id":"6726ef60629055e1383b719f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buddy Messinger","original_name":"Buddy Messinger","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":"/gUNoa7hESyMNtOtqT73iB92yAH7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Freddie Littlefield","credit_id":"6726ef817e8fc5a821f9279c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Cogley","original_name":"Nick Cogley","popularity":0.199,"profile_path":"/lbIxmCvhMbjFDne97WFvqAv10KG.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6726efe6cdead30fbdb50ca4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cossar","original_name":"John Cossar","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":"/eSNYJl4CY2nJkRO3VXY5V5hlQ3e.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6726effbcdead30fbdb50cb0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3499850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Bates","original_name":"Katherine Bates","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Aunt Ellen","credit_id":"6726efaf7e8fc5a821f927b6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1363932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cordelia Callahan","original_name":"Cordelia Callahan","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6726efd6cdead30fbdb50c9e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4892932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Dunn","original_name":"Marie Dunn","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6726f05257722b55717a98ed","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935862,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kenneth Earl","original_name":"Kenneth Earl","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6726f05b7e8fc5a821f927dc","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1638770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucretia Harris","original_name":"Lucretia Harris","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Iris","credit_id":"6726f06dc090109580f9cb71","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Madison","original_name":"Virginia Madison","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6726f07d57722b55717a98fe","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2544462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Moore","original_name":"Frederick Moore","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6726f08c57722b55717a990d","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edouard Trebaol","original_name":"Edouard Trebaol","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"6726f09c7e8fc5a821f927f1","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mason N.
