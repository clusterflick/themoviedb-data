A member of the nobility, Boris Skossyreff was a Nazi collaborator, “assistant” to the Queen of the Netherlands, but above all self-proclaimed king of the Principality of Andorra in 1934, quickly chased away by the French and Spanish authorities. Involved in the great conflicts of the 20th century from which he always emerged unscathed, this enigmatic man was in reality a professional crook and forger, but also a gigolo, organizer of orgies… An unpublished documentary, based on a fascinating investigation carried out over more than a decade, in collaboration with an international team of historians and advisors.","popularity":0.3014,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AD","name":"Andorra"}],"release_date":"2024-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boris Skossyreff, l'escroc qui fut roi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5036140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Cebrián","original_name":"Jorge Cebrián","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672596aeb6b3f04b8f2d62d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5036142,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jorge Cebrián","original_name":"Jorge Cebrián","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672596b4789276892c2a49e5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3248,"name":"gigolo"},{"id":8207,"name":"crook"},{"id":13084,"name":"king"},{"id":269699,"name":"andorra"},{"id":338495,"name":"nazi collaborator"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Cinemania 2024","release_date":"2024-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BORIS SKOSSYREFF, L’ESCROC QUI A ÉTÉ ROI de Jorge Cebrián - CINEMANIA 2024","key":"oVAsIYeSN-k","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-10-23T16:01:02.000Z","id":"67259758ed9fe88b1b994064"}]}}}
