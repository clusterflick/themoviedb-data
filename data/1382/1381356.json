Shortly before his execution, Chénier is visited by his lover Maddalena, who has decided to die at the poet's side. “Our death is the triumph of love”, the lovers promise each other in their last words.  The French Revolution, which was initially demanded by the people, turns out to be a machine of terror after 1789: spies of the regime pursue the citizens, show trials serve as a deterrent and the guillotine ensures that the sentences are carried out. Although the wanted Chénier could flee Paris, he decides against it. He wants to know who is behind the letters that are secretly delivered to him. Here, in the shadow of the reign of terror, love triumphs: Chénier and Maddalena find each other, swear eternal love and are faithful to each other until their last breath together.","popularity":0.1249,"poster_path":"/idgvlm7kximM5oetA86Nt1YvOAf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giordano:
