This tells the story of an ordinary farmer (Tim Grimwood), and his struggles as a boy starting out in 1900, to a farm labourer come the second world war. The story documents the ebbs and flows of the fortunes of such as him in the industry over those 40 years, and (as the name suggests) has an air of new dawn, whereby farmers essential to the war effort would at last secure a fair deal.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":116828,"logo_path":null,"name":"Realist Film Unit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1942-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Harvest Shall Come","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Belfrage","original_name":"Bruce Belfrage","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":"/2Yldx2OExUdbSEgCehVmd9hnljs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Commentator (voice)","credit_id":"6724cd4dba4f82cb22b05379","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Anderson","original_name":"Max Anderson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724ccdcba4f82cb22b052ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1161420","wikidata_id":"Q16983398","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1942-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
