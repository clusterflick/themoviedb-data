Now, he once again returns to these places and finds out that his own biography overlaps with the biographies of his found again protagonists as well as with the history of this region. During his search for traces, Koepp at the same time finds new people, new regions, and new themes that are also worth becoming a part of Koepp′s narration.","popularity":0.0985,"poster_path":"/3PLdtSihnxVLyBCI9Pk8DIqUBd1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin - Stettin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritzi Haberlandt","original_name":"Fritzi Haberlandt","popularity":0.3119,"profile_path":"/xx2zbZBCNWYBI1oD1QT5WLzQgbC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"59a65278c3a36827e90057e8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":22650,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rainer Böhm","original_name":"Rainer Böhm","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5939462392514108b300fa95","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volker Koepp","original_name":"Volker Koepp","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/f3Yb6zVCMsjIhncmcd10a9LvFdm.jpg","credit_id":"593945e0c3a368788c01028e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volker Koepp","original_name":"Volker Koepp","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/f3Yb6zVCMsjIhncmcd10a9LvFdm.jpg","credit_id":"593945e8c3a3687819011537","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047380,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Beatrice Babin","original_name":"Beatrice Babin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5939461bc3a368787c00ffb0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Plenert","original_name":"Thomas Plenert","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f93883d81748ccff99a9ca","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1532271","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":842,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3PLdtSihnxVLyBCI9Pk8DIqUBd1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vienna International Film Festival","release_date":"2009-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Leipzig DOK Festival","release_date":"2009-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
