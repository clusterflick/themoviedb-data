Timothy Leary was getting married to a model named Nena Von Schlebrugge up in Millbrook, New York at the Hitchcock house, where Leary had been carrying on his hallucinogenic revelries for the past year or so after leaving Harvard. It was rumored that this was going to be the wedding of the season, the wedding of Mr. And Mrs. Swing as Cab Calloway put it.  Blackwood took me downtown to meet Monte Rock III who was singing at Trudy Heller’s but who was also a very pricey and off-the-wall hairdresser and was in fact going to be doing the bride’s hair.  Nena’s brother, Bjorn, known as the “Baron” was a friend of the Hitchcock’s, as was I, and the idea of going along and filming the wedding seemed not unwarranted. I’ve always wanted to film someone getting married.\"","popularity":0.3311,"poster_path":"/8ica3YGnciaWlDtU030uA3VrQfP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91189,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leacock-Pennebaker","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1964-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You’re Nobody Till Somebody Loves You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Timothy Leary's Wedding","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Leary","original_name":"Timothy Leary","popularity":0.1858,"profile_path":"/kFTPQ1ood6HKh1hRRr4wLe76JHN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"593a52579251411ee9009b67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1830776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monti Rock III","original_name":"Monti Rock III","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"593a52a1c3a368231200911c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1830777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane Arbus","original_name":"Diane Arbus","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/vmGyTra480uJMtBrHMbKdRNDHUl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"593a533ac3a3682312009188","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Mingus","original_name":"Charles Mingus","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/yMAEEKuTqkuT4MN2isvD98AHCun.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"593a537e9251411eff009e20","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nena Von Schlebrugge","original_name":"Nena Von Schlebrugge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"593a539bc3a36822f8009002","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Leary","original_name":"Susan Leary","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"593a53b5c3a3682305009d73","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.
