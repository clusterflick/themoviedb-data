She was the first American who entered the home of the “Red Napoleon”. The fruit of this friendship is a film, personal and politically involved at the same time. Travelling across the country and talking to important figures as well as ordinary people, the director finds out more about her roots and offers the audience a unique perspective on Vietnam’s present and past.","popularity":0.1996,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2017-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The General And Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":933134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiana Alexandra","original_name":"Tiana Alexandra","popularity":0.1549,"profile_path":"/zSbNBTcRgXa8SJiMhpNDRnRTgkf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"593a59d99251411f0400a22f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1830803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Võ Nguyên Giáp","original_name":"Võ Nguyên Giáp","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/hKrZIgpHMEJuJVLjHISI2blKu88.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"593a59f9c3a3682320009e95","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":933134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiana Alexandra","original_name":"Tiana Alexandra","popularity":0.1549,"profile_path":"/zSbNBTcRgXa8SJiMhpNDRnRTgkf.jpg","credit_id":"639b7c2addd52d00d921f5e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6779,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stirling Silliphant","original_name":"Stirling Silliphant","popularity":0.1847,"profile_path":"/iJ5AJl2CiNuSsxb94NhjFgvZDAu.jpg","credit_id":"639b7c1a03726400a356f396","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12952,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christopher Hampton","original_name":"Christopher Hampton","popularity":0.2272,"profile_path":"/utg2E5j1D4xt5vgoUnrc4WEh7fE.jpg","credit_id":"593a5a749251411ee900a1e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":933134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiana Alexandra","original_name":"Tiana Alexandra","popularity":0.1549,"profile_path":"/zSbNBTcRgXa8SJiMhpNDRnRTgkf.jpg","credit_id":"593a5a17c3a36822f80094f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571519,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Filip Cichecki","original_name":"Filip Cichecki","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671a20284542e371fe0a4e68","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4084952","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2957,"name":"vietnam war"},{"id":2956,"name":"vietnam"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
