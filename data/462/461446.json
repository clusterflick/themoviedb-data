Clara, a forty year old 'tai tai' (wealthy lady of leisure) faces a mid life crisis and decides to runaway to the only place that has ever made any sense to her - the shopping centres. As she lives there, Clara crosses paths with other 'creatures' of the mall, namely Renu, an eight-year old latchkey kid who has been abandoned by her parents in a 24 hour mall and Aaron, an angst-y twenty three year old who skives work to hang out at the mall with his friends. Together, these characters lead audiences through a journey of love, loss and liberation through the heart of Singapore where they find that their dreams can be bought and broken.","popularity":0.3151,"poster_path":"/m7Yk4lzcPB1V95LmhAuo8grwgl1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3753,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kismet Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2007-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"you never know what's in store","title":"Gone Shopping","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Pang","original_name":"Adrian Pang","popularity":0.1321,"profile_path":"/fOSFPav79lx1YmSj1R1IrsZ87On.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Valentine Tan","credit_id":"593d1826925141058f01cf4f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Kao","original_name":"Aaron Kao","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Aaron Ho","credit_id":"593d184fc3a3680f5901b770","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1233862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kym Ng","original_name":"Kym Ng","popularity":0.1082,"profile_path":"/bp1EKF0mGoPJuUb7iSgSzIhTuUr.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Clara Wong","credit_id":"5dc589326f8d950010c30f5d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":225060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Selena Tan","original_name":"Selena Tan","popularity":0.0848,"profile_path":"/oH16MYJqw2PTn9QZXmDFnbI4UsV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pat Huang","credit_id":"60d7181c6c0b360047ce5400","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonya Nair","original_name":"Sonya Nair","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Renu Balakrishnan","credit_id":"60d71887aa789800451cd6ff","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1015006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chen Shucheng","original_name":"Chen Shucheng","popularity":0.1973,"profile_path":"/bQDGIb6RQe9TNUdB9FcpgmwvEL2.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mr. Wong","credit_id":"60d71a7d109cd0002f4c8e22","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1831855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Lin Wee","original_name":"Li Lin Wee","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593d178ac3a36828b20062df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1831855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Lin Wee","original_name":"Li Lin Wee","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593d17a1c3a3680f5901b6e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2266271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ler Jiyuan","original_name":"Ler Jiyuan","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/rIimyniDjhCgdwi6i7UUzKexrWN.jpg","credit_id":"5dc588efab1bc70015ff39da","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1060253","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m7Yk4lzcPB1V95LmhAuo8grwgl1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/khBttQu62x1RO55KiQI4LweL4m3.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":700},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2049,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i0E4C6BA5yTo48jZXMuueALtBVI.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1366},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wsVislQ4qt09PMfI4kqs7Dy0WFx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
