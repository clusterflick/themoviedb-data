In 1953, Inuit families were forcibly relocated to the uninhabited and inhospitable high arctic, 1500 kilometres north of their traditional homeland of Nunavik, in northern Qu√©bec. The goal of the move was to extend Canadian claims of sovereignty to Ellesmere Island. As a result, Inuit people were forced to endure the pain of families torn apart and many years of hardship. With devastating first-person accounts of survival, the trail of broken promises and shameful practices of the government and the RCMP, this powerful documentary captures the long-standing effects of these events from the perspectives of the people who were forced to endure them.","popularity":0.077,"poster_path":"/6y8NnWLPv5ShwrmlU4bGjt8kNld.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zacharias Kunuk","original_name":"Zacharias Kunuk","popularity":0.1425,"profile_path":"/pnVX4dX4TJMY9QTEuD8xuxbrvAg.jpg","credit_id":"594197e5c3a36851f801a3da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5948186","wikidata_id":"Q49856214","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6y8NnWLPv5ShwrmlU4bGjt8kNld.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3355,"name":"inuit"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
