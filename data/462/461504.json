Narrated by William Shatner, and accompanied by a special digital \"surround\" recording of Antonio Vivaldi's The Four Seasons, the film takes audiences on a breathtaking trip through the eruption of spring, the growth of summer, the harvest and festivity of autumn, and the dormancy of winter. The beauty of the seasons is interspersed with a look at the earth as a planet, the sun as a star, and the human quest to understand the relationship between the two.","popularity":0.3712,"poster_path":"/40L4sqFmAKGxensc8F0Nv5aiTG9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seasons","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Shatner","original_name":"William Shatner","popularity":1.6281,"profile_path":"/puzpe91Lh0CzdRKg9iYilQsjoYk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"593d8915c3a3680f670223f0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mike Day","original_name":"Mike Day","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593d894bc3a3680f1401fd06","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557904,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Novros","original_name":"Paul Novros","popularity":0.0901,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593d896692514105870216a4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95759,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Douglas","original_name":"David Douglas","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/n3M8i8JtD22Fk0N46KnA2F5VZ3U.jpg","credit_id":"593d8976c3a36828b200b3a4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Shedd","original_name":"Ben Shedd","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/9T8ypppEPihoEbnNkvyr5BVXhME.jpg","credit_id":"593d8938925141058f0224f1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Shedd","original_name":"Ben Shedd","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/9T8ypppEPihoEbnNkvyr5BVXhME.jpg","credit_id":"593d892ac3a36828fc00c650","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75589,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Casey","original_name":"George Casey","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593d8958c3a3680f3301e01c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0093933","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/40L4sqFmAKGxensc8F0Nv5aiTG9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
