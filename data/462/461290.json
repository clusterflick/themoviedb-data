BalikBayan, which means “returnee” in Filipino, is partly about the homecoming of the historical figure Enrique of Malacca, a Malay who Tahimik first played and brought to the screen in 1979. As the slave of the 16th-century Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan he circumnavigated the Earth, before returning home as a free man. Old footage of Enrique, played by the young Tahimik, is mixed with the fictional story of a mysterious old man, played by the present-day Tahimik, and documentary footage of a contemporary artist community in Baguio, in northern Philippines. In this version, Redux VI, Tahimik continues his quest to reconsider the Philippines’ colonial legacy. Shot on 16mm (1979–1980s) and video (1990s–2017).","popularity":0.1501,"poster_path":"/nT4dO5i5YwPQwrVXH1viI5Ku726.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2017-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":159,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BalikBayan #1: Memories of Overdevelopment Redux VI","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kidlat Tahimik","original_name":"Kidlat Tahimik","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/tv8lgUFSWItme9FJm7XwR6lXjFI.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"593b7af892514105cf006c5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1444047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Steinberg","original_name":"George Steinberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"593b7b019251410587006467","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1444048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kawayan de Guia","original_name":"Kawayan de Guia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"593b7b0792514105cf006c6d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kidlat Tahimik","original_name":"Kidlat Tahimik","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/tv8lgUFSWItme9FJm7XwR6lXjFI.jpg","credit_id":"593b7b18c3a3680f14006410","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/67yT2a0Qp220aiPNbnQJsFKonvd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nT4dO5i5YwPQwrVXH1viI5Ku726.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ucIZJXxz7ZYD5FpxonZvYUtVNMJ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
