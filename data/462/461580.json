As part of their crazed dream to create a thousand-year Reich they developed detailed blueprints for Aryan settlements and vast hunting parks for ‘Aryan’ animals.  Goering and Himmler employed Germany’s best scientists to launch a hugely ambitious programme of genetic manipulation to change the course of nature itself, both in the wild and for domestic use.  In a fascinating blend of politics and biology, Hitler's Jurassic Monsters is the true and asthonishing story of how the Nazis tried to take control of nature and change the course of evolution.","popularity":0.3415,"poster_path":"/1I2OfuxT2wBA46wO9pUpg7xBWRV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitler's Jurassic Monsters","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Hitlerin muinaiset hirviöt","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4672081,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sam Cracey","original_name":"Sam Cracey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6628da31221ba6017c187e4d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4213936,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Duncan Fairs","original_name":"Duncan Fairs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6628da4e62f335017dddaf63","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1262575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Bristow","original_name":"Jeremy Bristow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5b87549251413f6b020fd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3983692","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jwifC6hQ09FP8fR1mJHCSo7lUWS.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1I2OfuxT2wBA46wO9pUpg7xBWRV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g98qKNwipXnEmjq2F5vHOE39yeR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2idDuQ3ru8OP6PQyWXoxy290lAS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2652,"name":"nazi"},{"id":3060,"name":"race politics"},{"id":33671,"name":"german shepherd"},{"id":33688,"name":"hunting"},{"id":160069,"name":"auroch"},{"id":163270,"name":"breeding"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
