After making a diverse group of films in the 80s, he reunited with Robert DeNiro for \"Goodfellas\" and later that year shot a segment for \"New York Stories\", an anthology film of three shorts by Scorsese, Woody Allen, and Francis Ford Coppola. During the editing, the French documentary series \"Cinéma, de notre temps\" filmed a documentary on the director, and it's a fascinating glimpse into his life, personality, and working habits as he edits his short with long-time collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker.","popularity":0.5,"poster_path":"/bLFI6P0vGp2vSD3ZianPVnxSI3p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Scorsese Machine","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Scorsese","original_name":"Martin Scorsese","popularity":2.5528,"profile_path":"/9U9Y5GQuWX3EZy39B8nkk4NY01S.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"593fcbd3c3a36803c100d5ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian De Palma","original_name":"Brian De Palma","popularity":1.0083,"profile_path":"/4xleWFdhtVC7faer6Ru2eyEgfTv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"593fcbe99251414b0200d5a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3661,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thelma Schoonmaker","original_name":"Thelma Schoonmaker","popularity":0.3708,"profile_path":"/wPkuc1cmcSH4I95uUbE7wgBsYA4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"593fcc059251414b0200d5bd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Powell","original_name":"Michael Powell","popularity":0.4097,"profile_path":"/qWXLb4nbYsGOrdrcTUL8s953JES.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"593fcc70c3a36803e600df97","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Scorsese","original_name":"Catherine Scorsese","popularity":0.4543,"profile_path":"/gQvsfbecS75QeJ0JNex7r5Yf6Z1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"611210b2f6596f0046a0ae81","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Scorsese","original_name":"Charles Scorsese","popularity":0.2468,"profile_path":"/x0dyaw0UQDH3Pw4TyITux2hphqV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"611210bc0c271000808863e2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Mougey","original_name":"Paul Mougey","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6601dacc770700017c0fac13","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André S.
