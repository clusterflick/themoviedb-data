Instead of propping up images of animal slaughter or beleaguered fishermen, A Whale of a Tale focuses on points of contact and communication between the two sides, foreign activists devoting years to the cause and agricultural workers who have developed a first-name familiarity. Sasaki (Herb & Dorothy) collaborates with journalist Jay Alabaster to examine the historical and material conditions that contributed to local whaling practice and the pressures of globalism and localism that keeps this issue in ideological deadlock—at least for now. -JAPAN CUTS: Festival of New Japanese Film","popularity":0.1211,"poster_path":"/wZjiby45AJZmcI6wLeDBUfCWAka.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Whale of a Tale","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Megumi Sasaki","original_name":"Megumi Sasaki","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593ac3499251411f0400ee81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2525688,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Masahiro Handa","original_name":"飯田雅裕","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798dcdcb921c548d82af832","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6122752","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/j1FIA6RysmzjxSbH9r5F3BziyUa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1448},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wZjiby45AJZmcI6wLeDBUfCWAka.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
