Sabeth and the narrator travel to France, Italy and Greece. But who is Sabeth? What does she feel towards the narrator? What does he feel towards her? The entire movie is shot in subjective view (we only see what the narrator sees); there are no dialogues, just his post-synchronised voice.","popularity":0.1962,"poster_path":"/o6Zlm1tepHf1a3tLLOjrlJlgUY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91170,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lea Produktion","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2015-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homo Faber (Trois femmes)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Trois Femmes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daphné Baiwir","original_name":"Daphné Baiwir","popularity":0.049,"profile_path":"/5K9m0LJlrfOxUss17Js7GOPlY4k.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Sabeth","credit_id":"59396464c3a36878ae010232","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1655865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Barron","original_name":"Amanda Barron","popularity":0.1114,"profile_path":"/ip5WmNmAi2f205IWMxMHOdaN9z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ivy","credit_id":"59396470c3a36878ae01023a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marthe Keller","original_name":"Marthe Keller","popularity":0.79,"profile_path":"/zRSAz0UNz5AS7B1tdizwZyodXnx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hanna","credit_id":"59396495925141088e012b07","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1885285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnaud Bedouët","original_name":"Arnaud Bedouët","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":"/brOfHuQYCbhXunFi3i5wPNvb50F.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"600e97cfdd83fa003d968aef","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Athanasios Maschas","original_name":"Athanasios Maschas","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"600e97d9b5bc21003e925104","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64063,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Max Frisch","original_name":"Max Frisch","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e9792813cb60041810a88","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Dindo","original_name":"Richard Dindo","popularity":0.0667,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e97890b5fd6003c5f0d58","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Dindo","original_name":"Richard Dindo","popularity":0.0667,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e97840e597b0041324d09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270935,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"René Zumbühl","original_name":"René Zumbühl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e97af9a6435003f9208f2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280979,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Charlotte Tourrès","original_name":"Charlotte Tourrès","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600e979db5bc21003e9250eb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3907334","wikidata_id":"Q18669596","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AeVXbcZQROnH7vejRziHjml6RlO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":801},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1410,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/o6Zlm1tepHf1a3tLLOjrlJlgUY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"10","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2014-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Solothurn Film Festival","release_date":"2015-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
