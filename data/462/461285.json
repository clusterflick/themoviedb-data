At the apartment of her married sister, Jane, Honey renews her acquaintance with Sara Foote, now a worldly New Yorker secretly jealous of Jane. Honey is disappointed when young architect Harvey Gibbs brings her home from an unspectacular evening, and she declines his numerous proposals. Ogden, already married, is also rejected by Honey, despite the luxury he offers her. Don Kendall, in conspiracy with Sara, tries to obtain love letters Ogden has written Honey, so as to blackmail him, and her refusal to give them up causes him to beat her brutally. Realizing that Ogden does not love her, Honey dismisses Gibbs, who doubts her. Jane leaves her husband and elopes with Don. Honey is ultimately united with Gibbs, who wins a prize for designing a church. The film is now lost.","popularity":0.3361,"poster_path":"/sYBstkPoSoMMDI5ppz0RrAhc6CA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"LIFE'S GREATEST MISTAKE\" WOULD BE NOT SEEING \"LOVE'S GREATEST MISTAKE\"","title":"Love's Greatest Mistake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Brent","original_name":"Evelyn Brent","popularity":0.1511,"profile_path":"/xGu2aE9ZpZMtwvpkuCl3kwsfuVv.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jane","credit_id":"593b65afc3a3680f59005421","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Powell","original_name":"William Powell","popularity":0.5224,"profile_path":"/8DTWs389THkVCTiDFu0x8ekNmUC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Don Kendall","credit_id":"593b65b9925141059b0054d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Hall","original_name":"James Hall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Harvey Gibbs","credit_id":"593b65c692514105970052c2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":592395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Dunn","original_name":"Josephine Dunn","popularity":0.168,"profile_path":"/1iOqpnIIzUCBvUcpI1Bqzy0Xtof.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Honey McNeil","credit_id":"593b65d0c3a3680f420058eb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Morgan","original_name":"Frank Morgan","popularity":0.4522,"profile_path":"/gwbmaZ6EGYbsBbe8pWW3Gded02k.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"William Ogden","credit_id":"593b65e492514105cf0059fa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3348803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iris Gray","original_name":"Iris Gray","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sara Foote","credit_id":"621bca50d363e5001ce31903","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3446218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Byrne","original_name":"Betty Byrne","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lovey Gibbs","credit_id":"621bca5eaf2da8004360709a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A.
