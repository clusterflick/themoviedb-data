In the words of Ed Pincus: \"It was the Summer of Love, 1967. The Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco was to be the center of a vast cultural experiment. Ideologically it was an attempt at a post-industrial society, where people no longer needed to work and communities of choice allowed people to “do their own thing.” David Neuman and I set off to film what happened that summer. We decided to do what we thought would be a film about a rural commune, because that seemed to be the apotheosis of hippie ideals. What we found was a bizarre replication of bourgeois society—the sun rose on the nothing new. We decided to use an anecdotal editing style with an attempt to enforce a narrative line.\"","popularity":0.0841,"poster_path":"/kO9Fd5k6jH9ucWU1X186nFEhc7W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Step Away","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Neuman","original_name":"David Neuman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593a5a90c3a3682371009db6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Pincus","original_name":"Ed Pincus","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/24m0aUyeWTXmAtveXIXp9PMW2l1.jpg","credit_id":"593a5a7ac3a36822d2009b3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kO9Fd5k6jH9ucWU1X186nFEhc7W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":648}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1968-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
