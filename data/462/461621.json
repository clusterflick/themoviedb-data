The story is fairly simple -- a typical Everyboy named Billy wants to learn how to 'get all the girls,' just like Kyle, the school's resident emo kid. Of course, every teen can use a little helping hand, and so Billy is walked through the how-to's of emo by the disembodied voice of The Narrator who utilizes a unique visual flair (think 1950's instructional video married to quirky animation), Bretz and Reed sketch out the intricacies, ironies, and absurdities of the emo phenomenon with surgical precision and an abundance of hilarious tongue-in-cheek humor.  - Written by KBC Media Relations","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":91319,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perpetual Something Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Be: Emo","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trent Teigen","original_name":"Trent Teigen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"593f0467c3a36803f600090b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832479,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brennan Reed","original_name":"Brennan Reed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator / Billy's Father","credit_id":"593f047f9251414b1d000908","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Dümler","original_name":"Kevin Dümler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Johnny Football","credit_id":"593f048ec3a368041a000897","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Jaeger","original_name":"James Jaeger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Kyle","credit_id":"593f0ba39251414afb000eae","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angel Orlando","original_name":"Angel Orlando","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Sange","credit_id":"593f0bc19251414b02000eae","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brennan Reed","original_name":"Brennan Reed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593f09909251414af6000d8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xtian Bretz","original_name":"Xtian Bretz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593f09cfc3a36803e6000da4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832500,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Xtian Bretz","original_name":"Xtian Bretz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593f0b02c3a36803e6000e76","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832479,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brennan Reed","original_name":"Brennan Reed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593f0b559251414aee000f20","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0477720","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"How To Be Emo Trailer","key":"x_9DvhTuKyw","published_at":"2010-02-23T10:38:18.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"593f080e9251414af6000c70"}]}}}
