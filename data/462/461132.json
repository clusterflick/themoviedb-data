Album wideofoniczny","overview":"Painter Zdzisław Beksiński, his wife Zofia and their son Tomasz, a well-known radio journalist and translator, were a typical and unconventional family, both at the same time. One of the father’s obsessions was filming himself and his family members. Using archival footage only, shot primarily by Zdzisław, as well many other materials, which have not been presented anywhere so far, the film tells a tragic story of the Beksińskis that has never ceased to fascinate Polish filmmakers.","popularity":0.3754,"poster_path":"/zl409IqauDbB8EyvC5A7nYoEH3h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Darek Dikti Biuro Pomyslow","origin_country":""},{"id":115045,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gdynski Fundusz Filmowy","origin_country":""},{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2017-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beksińskis.
