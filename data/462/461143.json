La belle dame sans merci follows a famous actress who was once seduced and abandoned by a rich man and subsequently resolved to become a “merciless woman,” forever scheming to hurt others (men in particular) in a ruthless yet captivating manner. Dulac challenges the Romantic archetype embodied in Keats’s poem by way of symbolist mise en scène, self-reflexive narration, and her typically associative approach to editing, locating a modern ambiguity within the stereotypical figures of 19th-century art.\" - Film Society of Lincoln Center","popularity":0.1257,"poster_path":"/3LJboSE4lhz2uuJvZ9Be2dbThCl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91191,"logo_path":null,"name":"D.H.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1921-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beautiful Woman Without Mercy","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tania Daleyme","original_name":"Tania Daleyme","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lola de Sandoval","credit_id":"593a58f2c3a36822f800942f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yolande Hillé","original_name":"Yolande Hillé","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Irène","credit_id":"593a59139251411ef8009e90","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1349998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Lorys","original_name":"Denise Lorys","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/3XkgESPMasDy4MMvlj402JCzf8h.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Comtesse d'Amaury","credit_id":"593a59319251411ef300a0d5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Toulout","original_name":"Jean Toulout","popularity":0.1296,"profile_path":"/cpv9nwb18Sg4XHdHl2bVsO8vu4G.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Comte Guy d'Amaury","credit_id":"593a596f9251411f25009c21","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1151379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Tarride","original_name":"Jean Tarride","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Hubert d'Amaury","credit_id":"593a59869251411eff00a2af","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Mareg","original_name":"Pierre Mareg","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Marquis de Saint-Érasme","credit_id":"593a599d9251411eff00a2c2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Glen","original_name":"Lucien Glen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Lucien","credit_id":"593a59b4c3a3682312009655","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Monfils","original_name":"Louis Monfils","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"593a5a099251411f0400a252","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830797,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jacques Oliver","original_name":"Jacques Oliver","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593a58c2c3a36822d20099fa","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":997694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germaine Dulac","original_name":"Germaine Dulac","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/n0rxdRSsnT1CvowdjSq6If1AMal.jpg","credit_id":"593a58189251411ef8009da5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":997694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germaine Dulac","original_name":"Germaine Dulac","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/n0rxdRSsnT1CvowdjSq6If1AMal.jpg","credit_id":"5d10815f0e0a263a65ca07b4","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1830809,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Irène Hillel-Erlanger","original_name":"Irène Hillel-Erlanger","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d108156c3a36810c71e49e4","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0131966","wikidata_id":"Q3206558","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kKUuaavcUEsGM3RPNuV2LXNhV0V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3LJboSE4lhz2uuJvZ9Be2dbThCl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1921-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
