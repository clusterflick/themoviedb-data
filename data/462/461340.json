Originally conceived as a long-form promotional piece for «Press to Play», the BBC staffer (Richard Skinner) persuades Macca to talk about much more, including one of the more in-depth interviews about Wings. All of the interview bits were done at Abbey Road studio 2, leading to some reminiscing on Paul's part. Scattered among the interview are some nice McCartney film rarities (including rarely seen promo clips/videos, concert footage from both the 1973 and 1976 tours, and even a bit of the never released \"One Hand Clapping\" film).","popularity":0.5356,"poster_path":"/lDraEmyqIhmyxPVMUNyiiMYAGtb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1986-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Paul McCartney Special","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul McCartney","original_name":"Paul McCartney","popularity":1.1874,"profile_path":"/sCPsv9ueP5UR6BkMSmRDlwbra6S.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"593c041e925141059700e204","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Skinner","original_name":"Richard Skinner","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/xuXznqpeAuQcX16u6osX3MRcpyv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"593c0438925141059b00e5df","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Howard Davies","original_name":"John Howard Davies","popularity":0.3371,"profile_path":"/xe4IWezr7ZTqk3FPZMIsu3xGE4k.jpg","credit_id":"593c0621925141058f00ef07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0261059","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g9HydBEykGQBXZawm38nAVVSOdF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lDraEmyqIhmyxPVMUNyiiMYAGtb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x2TzlGIEGpQF4qZmxM56D1Xo6xb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6tj5IZFhjjLEgNjYlr9XCiLkIAd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4434,"name":"interview"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Paul Mccartney Special Trailer 1987","key":"bcbxYUmQXsM","published_at":"2014-06-10T15:31:05.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"593c0645925141059b00e779"}]}}}
