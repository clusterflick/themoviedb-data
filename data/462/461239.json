It is a celebration of my fatherâ€™s life, a meditation on his body and a visual record of mourning. When my father died, there was never a chance to see his body after life had left it. This film was made by placing his ashes directly on 35mm film in a dark room and moving the film a frame at a time. What we see in this process of photograming is not the object in the photographic sense, but instead a representation of the space surrounding an object. The photogram is a shadow charting the distance between things.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/46c5KibmKNHTkqnYJrPICapCJcZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Stewart","original_name":"Eric Stewart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593ad9639251411f0400ff8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/46c5KibmKNHTkqnYJrPICapCJcZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
