Though he was king of the island, Tõll often worked as a common farmer, tending to his crops and returning to his loving wife. He was a good king, often quick to anger but always kind and willing to help his fellow man. Tõll's greatest enemy is  the god of the underworld who specializes in sly, cowardly mischief. When war comes to the island, Tõll arrives to aid his dying army, but the devil takes advantage of his absence to wreak havoc on Tõll's home.","popularity":0.2294,"poster_path":"/3sNX2MXIb4rzRXBLfokBqbI3Ls6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6147,"logo_path":"/ygdtYCejdFLfMWht1M8XOwuM3Sj.png","name":"Tallinnfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet
