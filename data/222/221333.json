Between 1965 and 1973, the band had 7 Top-30 singles on the Billboard Pop Singles chart, including their classic \"Nights In White Satin\", which soared to #2 on the charts. After a 5-year hiatus, they returned in the late 70’s with several minor hits, until releasing \"Your Wildest Dreams\" in 1986, which peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart (and went #1 on the Adult Contemporary charts).  The Moody Blues’ lone appearance at the Montreux Jazz Festival occurred on July 3, 1991 at the Montreux Casino, while in support of their Keys Of The Kingdom album. The group (which includes long-time members Justin Hayward, Graeme Edge, John Lodge, and Ray Thomas) performs a number of their biggest hits, including \"Gemini Dream\", \"Nights In White Satin\", \"I’m Just A Singer (In A Rock & Roll Band)\", and \"Your Wildest Dreams\".","popularity":0.1133,"poster_path":"/rV8pDq0wuym1lcIZiZ5UiZ8eAOX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moody Blues: Live at Montreux 1991","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1467891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graeme Edge","original_name":"Graeme Edge","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":"/4cfJ75KaFWH8HdqlmyhrVTn45PZ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"drums, vocals","credit_id":"58e780e0c3a3684a79042a96","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Hayward","original_name":"Justin Hayward","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/bsV1WHl8yae5kCiTtG7pJ2Q7tCX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"vocals, guitar","credit_id":"5ce2465b9251412ce1bcda4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1791538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lodge","original_name":"John Lodge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fK9MUXajbcBdLHF00M5tt2CvgIi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"bass, vocals","credit_id":"5ce246699251413e65b94036","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2818451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Thomas","original_name":"Ray Thomas","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/iT6rhaxHbigFegxKgflg7cQMPro.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67f7e999de5e4dec62ad3a58","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1087465","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Blz0T2IzISFmUpk2mipRZ4P2Es.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bwWUkwi2qyRJV9H9pTKkqfikPTM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jo7E3GED678JRwchnb60eCQsuDj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rV8pDq0wuym1lcIZiZ5UiZ8eAOX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
