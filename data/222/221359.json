Opfindelser","overview":"This puppet film recreates some of Danish humorist Storm P.'s popular cartoons - the so-called \"inventions\". A \"Storm P. Invention\" is how Danes would describe a highly complicated technical design. The design of these apparatuses reflects an original satirical view on a society obsessed by efficiency and technocratization. The fun is derived from the lack of proportion between the diminutive scale of the problem and incomprehensible complexity of Storm P.'s solution.","popularity":0.1612,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2001-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Storm P.
