His parents, ideological old hippies, want to restrict Dieter's freedom as little as possible, but they still want to make the love-struck Candy appealing to him. Annoyed by the constant demands, Dieter leaves the house and finds himself in a nightclub. There he meets Petra, who is about to get married to Hilmar, the heir to millions. Petra wants to enjoy one last love affair with Dieter before the wedding. After a passionate kiss, they are both thrown back to 1972. Dieter, who regains consciousness in a shared flat in Berlin, finds out that Petra is in Munich, whereupon he sets off to find her. His journey holds many a bizarre adventure, such as a meeting with his young hippie parents.","popularity":0.4123,"poster_path":"/5E2M6zl8w64JB28b78bArz7FYO2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vision
