This time, Mike raises the stakes by adding guitarist Griff Peters to the mix, allowing the quintet to rise to new heights of musical power, diversity and subtlety. Live favorites are mixed delectably with seldom-played gems from Mike's catalogue to create a truly astonishing DVD and CD set. The region-free NTSC DVD of the entire September 15, 2010 concert features stereo audio, DTS 5.1 Surround and Dolby 5.1 Surround, and the CD comes in just seconds short of the maximum possible 80 minutes.  Mike Keneally Band is Mike Keneally: guitar, keyboard and vocals, Bryan Beller: bass and vocals, Rick Musallam: guitar and vocals, Griff Peters: Guitar, and Joe Travers: drums and vocals.","popularity":0.1656,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bakin' @ the Potato!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Beller","original_name":"Bryan Beller","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/461rkjD0XQTNTuNAbGzgRTNM1wM.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4dc69251416c7514037f","department":"Crew","job":"Compositors"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206446,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rick Musallam","original_name":"Rick Musallam","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dc69251416c7514038b","department":"Crew","job":"Compositors"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Keneally","original_name":"Mike Keneally","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/penyHJ2h9jOZRNcY60ETfRS0L5P.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4dc59251416c75140379","department":"Crew","job":"Compositors"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206445,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Joe Travers","original_name":"Joe Travers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dc69251416c75140385","department":"Crew","job":"Compositors"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206447,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Griff Peters","original_name":"Griff Peters","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dc69251416c75140391","department":"Crew","job":"Compositors"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
