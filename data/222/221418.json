No one understood the financial markets better than Hank Paulson, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs. In Hank: Five Years from the Brink, Paulson tells the complete story of how he persuaded banks, Congress and presidential candidates to sign off on nearly $1 trillion in bailouts - even as he found the behavior that led to the crisis, and the bailouts themselves, morally reprehensible. Directed by Academy Award nominee Joe Berlinger (Paradise Lost Trilogy, Some Kind of Monster), the film features Paulson, and his wife of 40 years, Wendy. it's a riveting portrait of leadership under unimaginable pressure - and a marriage under unfathomable circumstances.","popularity":0.5862,"poster_path":"/C4AapWIYdmtK3RB1ImihONEN9E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hank: 5 Years from the Brink","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hank: Five Years from the Brink","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Paulson","original_name":"Henry Paulson","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/qfs2bMEyaDfQYHOd91CFKoRo5aZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self -
