Sixgill sharks, ghost sharks (chimaeras), big-finned squid (Magnapinna), telescope octopuses, siphonophores (Bathyphysa), drifting jellyfish, and the silent abyss cleaning team: sea cucumbers and giant isopods. Visit hydrothermal vents, where chemosynthetic microbes feed oases of life with giant tubeworms (Riftia pachyptila) and Pompeii worms; glide over coral gardens of seamounts and ancient schools of sponges; watch as wooden and whale waterfalls transform darkness into cities of life; and pause at octopus farms, heated by gentle filtrations.  This film features only real footage of deep-sea creatures, filmed by NOAA's incredible ocean exploration institutes and the Schmidt Oceanographic Institute.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Deep Dark Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
