Despite Elliot's request of his mother that she say nothing, Mrs London begins speaking to Chrissy in far too much detail about her own puberty and Elliot's. As Elliot's privacy is shattered by his mother's personal revelations, he realizes any hope he has of a date with Chrissy is dashed to pieces - and he wishes he could be, too. So, no one is more surprised than Elliot when Mrs London's absolute frankness delivers dividends.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/lib3wKa1D6nZrzmE4AbJMhqM5Si.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Car Pool","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kerry Armstrong","original_name":"Kerry Armstrong","popularity":0.5243,"profile_path":"/1wKMkKLQoWc4Com8EcZyFRIKgV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mrs. London","credit_id":"69961ced0a2a6f1e813df028","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1213285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taryn Marler","original_name":"Taryn Marler","popularity":0.3673,"profile_path":"/6803zKnmdYqNdV51RXpEBqvbLxn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"69961d09063917edd3863466","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1843486,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martha Goddard","original_name":"Martha Goddard","popularity":0.5905,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69961d3754467b4df51b097f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815294,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen M.
