Through archival footage, radio transmissions, testimonies, and scenes of daily life in liberated zones, the film traces the station’s military, political, and cultural role, from reporting on combat operations and peasant struggles to fostering literacy, music, and international solidarity. The documentary portrays Radio Venceremos not only as a strategic instrument of war, but as a symbol of resistance, collective organization, and revolutionary memory.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"10 Years of Taking the Sky by Storm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
