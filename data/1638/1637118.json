A stranger who has settled in an abandoned house next door reveals to the girl a fantastic world that was hidden in the routine of summer cottage life. However, not everyone is ready to understand her friendship with an adult man, who obviously has something to hide. Anya is also shocked and disappointed when it turns out that she is not the only one — the mysterious stranger also communicates with her friend Amaranta, also gives her gifts and tells stories. They are angry at him and at each other. The stranger is both their main secret and a bone of contention.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raw Tooth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandr Galibin","original_name":"Александр Галибин","popularity":1.9573,"profile_path":"/3PmUkAbskqVaBf6YA0pv5sLuy5u.jpg","credit_id":"6994572bf54a18b95c850d81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
