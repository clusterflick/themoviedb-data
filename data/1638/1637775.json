The technology surrounding him is advanced, intelligent, and deeply unhelpful.\r The AI designed to solve humanity’s problems is instead busy dealing with humanity.  Artificial Insanity is a short film inspired by excruciating reality. It explores automation, irritation, and the peculiar optimism required to believe that this time someone useful might be sent to fix the broadband.  The film has screened at:  Ferrara Film Festival (Golden Dragon Nomination)\r Birmingham Film Festival (Best Sound Design Nomination, Bull Award Nomination)\r Screaming Ostrich Film Festival\r Folkestone Film Festival\r Black Country Horror Shorts\r Seattle Film Festival (Online Semi-Finalist)  Written & Directed by Neil Evans.
