After using an online dating service during the pandemic for older singles, they talk on the phone for three months and fall in love before meeting in person. Now living in Austin, Texas, and married for three years, the two wear lavish matching outfits, go out dancing several nights a week, and have an active sexual life rooted in both fantasy and intimacy. With a deep awareness of their mortality guiding their choices, Dan and Doris are not afraid to show up in the world as their true selves, disregarding cultural norms for how older people should look, love, and move through the world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Forcefield of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4264974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liz Moskowitz","original_name":"Liz Moskowitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994a31591f837c2d4fa4116","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4264975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Riley Engemoen","original_name":"Riley Engemoen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994a31d5bd26248e12afd35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4264974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liz Moskowitz","original_name":"Liz Moskowitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994a3264dc463a6f46f7665","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4264975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Riley Engemoen","original_name":"Riley Engemoen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994a339563b3a6bc585115d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4264975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Riley Engemoen","original_name":"Riley Engemoen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994a34311430905432afbf5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4264974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liz Moskowitz","original_name":"Liz Moskowitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994a363ef35702faf959b19","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4065413,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Drewsky Hulett","original_name":"Drewsky Hulett","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994a36e332a0c696a0661e9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39370914","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SXSW Film FEstival","release_date":"2026-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
