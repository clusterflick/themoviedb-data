In 2024, 608 people in Maricopa County died from heat-related illness, representing a staggering increase over the past decade. The film follows the crew at Arizona’s busiest firehouse, as they race to save heatstroke victims using a radical new treatment. Against the backdrop of rising global temperatures, urban heat islands, and under-resourced services, Phoenix has become a climate canary. \"A New Inferno\" offers a visceral, street-level view of the climate crisis as it unfolds in one of the hottest major cities on Earth.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4I5NocnG6LWmqi0OAlEnAm83CPu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192049,"logo_path":"/3IhxEMVbIWqPQQOsiYHpVF7upoY.png","name":"Masa
