Bertil lives in a decommissioned railway station in Skåne. He is internationally renowned, with monumental works displayed across Sweden, yet to gather the courage to walk to the local grocery store he needs a few glasses of wine under his belt. He is powerful, imaginative, humorous, and a resourceful storyteller. He jokes and performs for those around him whenever the opportunity arises. His sculptures are geometrically and mathematically calculated, and his tools are meticulously organized — but his life can be chaotic.  One day, something happens: Bertil’s sculptures have disappeared.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
