His main interest in life has to do with winning a beautiful girl and providing plenty of slumber for himself. Each morning, he is awakened by a harp solo - and all is well except for the fact that his prospective father-in-law does not rate him very high. However, his opportunity comes at last to prove his worth when he frustrates the plans of a crooked contractor who is constructing an unsound dam for father-in-law.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mYem5mlJu8MxFcsC5D89c1LLdCB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Control Yourself","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1060841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney Smith","original_name":"Sidney Smith","popularity":0.6127,"profile_path":"/ahzcCkzwZo3MseW6heNeHXSUwte.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Simon Legree","credit_id":"69946dc158d265fdba85118c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2308959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Bennett","original_name":"Catherine Bennett","popularity":0.5896,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Simon's Sweetheart","credit_id":"69946dd358cfac1f8e959c97","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Steers","original_name":"Larry Steers","popularity":1.6504,"profile_path":"/8QBHXihnGldVMNIxnbW2ljTk7Y1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Barton","credit_id":"69946de21fa6a7e7ca95987f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Weed","original_name":"Frank Weed","popularity":0.1592,"profile_path":"/pnZATaW6qWMUzP8teop6IFP9vPr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Father","credit_id":"69946deb1fa6a7e7ca959885","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert P.
