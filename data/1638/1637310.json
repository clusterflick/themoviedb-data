L'Utopia di Henry Dunant","overview":"Tutti Fratelli. L'Utopia di Henry Dunant, is dedicated to the figure and untiring activity of the Geneva philanthropist who sacrificed his family fortunes to the idea of the Red Cross [fallen to poverty, he lived off a modest income which only just allowed him survival]. Cima, in telling the story of the founder of the Red Cross, resorts to original documents, photographs, and images shot in the places where Dunant lived (from Geneva to Solferino and San Martino, from Marseille to Zurich, to Provence, to Tunisia). There comes to light an enthralling story which “tells”, thanks to a “clear and shared exploration of his existential itinerary”, the greatness of a man who was wrongly banished in the shade.
