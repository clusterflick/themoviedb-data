After John, his British nobleman father, catches him stealing, Curtis runs away, but rather than try to change his nature, he decides to put his mother's legacy to good use. As a result, after he has risen to a prominent position in the United States, he starts stealing from those who belong to his own wealthy social set and then distributing the money among the poor.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":59061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shubert Film Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Social Highwayman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin August","original_name":"Edwin August","popularity":0.266,"profile_path":"/cpnHZ8of3zIXpsGG6jsLl7dCZ8s.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John Jaffray / Curtis Jaffray","credit_id":"6995db0728288d95a0c84f97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John St. Polis","original_name":"John St. Polis","popularity":0.4233,"profile_path":"/q242vTdxgXFTVjmtDB5sPjxfhHy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hanby","credit_id":"6995db100018f363521b035f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1352936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ormi Hawley","original_name":"Ormi Hawley","popularity":0.2012,"profile_path":"/bmb2jThurXgi4Rdy8hFoaSUOKM6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Countess Rossi","credit_id":"6995db1a4fbedd07461b0674","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Claire Elliott","original_name":"Alice Claire Elliott","popularity":0.3892,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Eleanore Hilton","credit_id":"6995db25800149a6a385033a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah Beery","original_name":"Noah Beery","popularity":0.6958,"profile_path":"/7VGAfjnR7FkuDk33bzTGZ4rnKg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hugh Jaffray","credit_id":"6995db2f94cd147c9f1b06e3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin August","original_name":"Edwin August","popularity":0.266,"profile_path":"/cpnHZ8of3zIXpsGG6jsLl7dCZ8s.jpg","credit_id":"6995db3e94cd147c9f1b06e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6015682,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mary Stone","original_name":"Mary Stone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6995db7671f4fbe38b1b0353","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34741,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frances Marion","original_name":"Frances Marion","popularity":0.4597,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6995db8604d9864d18863288","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0007365","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
