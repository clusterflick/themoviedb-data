Through strike footage, congress meetings, marches, and first-person testimonies, the film portrays a society marked by state repression, workers’ mobilization, and efforts to build national and international solidarity. The documentary pays particular attention to the strike of the National Water Authority workers (ANDA), featuring members of the SETA union who describe the causes of the protest, the repression they faced, and the survival strategies adopted during the conflict. Testimonies from other unions, grassroots organizations, and international labor groups broaden the film’s perspective beyond a single labor dispute.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/L8fIXbVpnHX6nEU74Krf3BTOk7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SV","name":"El Salvador"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La luz que te decía","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6012880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Napoleón Duarte","original_name":"José Napoleón Duarte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6994ae97a454af4609125201","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Héctor Recinos","original_name":"Héctor Recinos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6994aea6ceafaf9be506602d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6004517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Óscar Arnulfo Romero","original_name":"Óscar Arnulfo Romero","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/pRNV4XOqWclZq0TpQN66EbYIXrn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6994af1af4154da13e2884f0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6013755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Pazos","original_name":"María Pazos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994aed0c765e230e71254df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2210783,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Manuel Sorto","original_name":"Manuel Sorto","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/bR3wpB2AHRuHKN7EDFEBoKlWy1H.jpg","credit_id":"6994b00fa454af460912521f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Talamanca","original_name":"Alberto Talamanca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994b0194a647e19a38511fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013766,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"César Caminos","original_name":"César Caminos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994b03654467b4df51aff8e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013768,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marcelo Iacarino","original_name":"Marcelo Iacarino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994b060563b3a6bc58511da","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013772,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gil Tablada","original_name":"Gil Tablada","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994b0889b3e30be806f78cc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013778,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luna Santamaría","original_name":"Luna Santamaría","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994b0a9c6af8d459f6f76ae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013780,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucía Rosas","original_name":"Lucía Rosas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994b0b89b3e30be806f78dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013782,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eugenia Bolaños","original_name":"Eugenia Bolaños","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994b0c90450aa73e906613c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2210783,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Manuel Sorto","original_name":"Manuel Sorto","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/bR3wpB2AHRuHKN7EDFEBoKlWy1H.jpg","credit_id":"6994b0e01628119781125289","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Talamanca","original_name":"Alberto Talamanca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994b0f011430905432afca7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/L8fIXbVpnHX6nEU74Krf3BTOk7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6346,"name":"trade union"},{"id":7605,"name":"el salvador"},{"id":368011,"name":"fenastras"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
