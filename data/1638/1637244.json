In the Morning Sun is a gentle portrait of aging, migration, and memory. Inspired by the filmmaker’s desire to preserve the warmth of his parents, the film reflects on the quiet sacrifices of immigration and the rituals that keep love alive across distance. As his nieces and nephews begin to face their own life choices, their reflections echo the journey his mother once made, revealing the duality of her experience—the little girl she was, and the woman she became to survive.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dSdTtkAzUD0Ycn314pqmHt5CBT7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":289597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Serve Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"In the Morning Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lydia Poblete","original_name":"Lydia Poblete","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"699491b6c765e230e7125412","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Almario Poblete","original_name":"Almario Poblete","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"699491bc332a0c696a066189","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Castro","original_name":"Ruth Castro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"699491c0037515daa5288364","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adyson Castor","original_name":"Adyson Castor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"699491c76beb9e50626f7740","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juby Bansil","original_name":"Juby Bansil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"699491cc451955ec64288588","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edric Bansil","original_name":"Edric Bansil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"699491d4037515daa528836f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3336307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serville Poblete","original_name":"Serville Poblete","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699491e0b37ca66b9d12500b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013448,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larochelle Poblete","original_name":"Larochelle Poblete","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699491ee02122c8a20288461","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013449,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicole Dane","original_name":"Nicole Dane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699491f94dc463a6f46f7648","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3336307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serville Poblete","original_name":"Serville Poblete","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69949201ceafaf9be5065faa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2155811,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucas Prokaziuk","original_name":"Lucas Prokaziuk","popularity":0.3194,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994920dbeda484cea288501","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39370752","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wz6Cf5emZPRUm7H5W2AkMfoh9g4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pn6FECg8Li44p03o3luhsc0zvFZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dSdTtkAzUD0Ycn314pqmHt5CBT7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SXSW Film Festival","release_date":"2026-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
