The only witness: her seeing-eye dog. Production collapsed after a week, and the footage was presumed lost, until its rediscovery in 2025. Painstakingly restored by WBAZ Films, this surviving fragment is presented here for the very first time.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/5aOIR8uwBb4Kmw0bsZUg1bhPwt7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In
