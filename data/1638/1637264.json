Their first conversation is ordinary, marked by awkward silences and fleeting glances. But as the last bus is delayed, they begin to talk more deeply.  Their connection grows gently, like a sudden spark in the monotony of an ordinary day. But when the bus finally arrives, a decision must be made: go their separate ways and return to their routines, or dare to extend this timeless encounter.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/dNJUVkl3Fm3pqvmcupMaUeqToBl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Bus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1126301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alix Bénézech","original_name":"Alix Bénézech","popularity":1.2892,"profile_path":"/fUz1bKAX3vxDwoa9sjsiwkGpwM6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gabrielle","credit_id":"699498eeb43d84eb821afd1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delphine Constant","original_name":"Delphine Constant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"699498faef476ad8d2959dac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clément Marty","original_name":"Clément Marty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bus driver","credit_id":"699499219b3e30be806f7862","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathalie Dupoirier","original_name":"Nathalie Dupoirier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699499386d6ccf38341afdc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathalie Dupoirier","original_name":"Nathalie Dupoirier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699499445bd26248e12afd2f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013557,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amélie Raulhac","original_name":"Amélie Raulhac","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69949955b37ca66b9d125056","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dNJUVkl3Fm3pqvmcupMaUeqToBl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
