He was not only a composer—he was also a designer, founder of a church, PR pioneer, author, and inventor of “musique d’ameublement,” a special kind of background music created for the purpose of shaping spaces acoustically. Satie’s concept of furniture music—sound wallpaper—his ideas of simplicity and clarity, were significant for the further development of minimalism. And yet, because of its plainness, his music was often criticized by contemporaries. The documentary presents Satie’s world with a wink—just as the eccentric and humorous composer viewed himself and the act of making music. A multifaceted, dazzling, and versatile personality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Satiesfiktionen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2431470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne-Kathrin Peitz","original_name":"Anne-Kathrin Peitz","popularity":0.6395,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994bd7b16281197811252de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1140213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Youlian Tabakov","original_name":"Youlian Tabakov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994bd8d3fbae15df32b00a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
