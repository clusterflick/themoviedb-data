The film reconstructs a failed 1973 documentary project, when a young Consalvi traveled from Venezuela to film Cardenal with a 16mm Bolex, only to discover the footage was ruined. Nearly five decades later, during the COVID-19 lockdown and after Cardenal’s death, father and son assemble photographs, archival images, and sound to evoke that encounter and the fragile persistence of memory, turning loss, decay, and time into the material of the film itself.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/k5DPu9xITGbYkDsxUbp2lxJQatt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":289579,"logo_path":null,"name":"Museo de la Palabra y la Imagen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SV","name":"El Salvador"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solentiname","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernesto Cardenal","original_name":"Ernesto Cardenal","popularity":0.2559,"profile_path":"/x75pphWTOhUyHEPaiGLjKpKaNOj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6994652b9290b95094288270","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1621631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Henríquez-Consalvi","original_name":"Carlos Henríquez Consalvi","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/e1sf9JLDdRIBOIdybdYmtKJKF3V.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6994653777403baa2f1afd00","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elvis Chavarría","original_name":"Elvis Chavarría","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6994676e6d6ccf38341afca7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Guerra","original_name":"Donald Guerra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6994677aa1f934a02c1afaf3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camilo Henríquez","original_name":"Camilo Henríquez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994657c11430905432afad5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1621631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Henríquez-Consalvi","original_name":"Carlos Henríquez Consalvi","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/e1sf9JLDdRIBOIdybdYmtKJKF3V.jpg","credit_id":"6994674d9290b9509428827f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camilo Henríquez","original_name":"Camilo Henríquez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994675b30e7fbd35d850e99","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ckdHKriFjzbvHmpG36P4WyJFxJY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2586,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nW3JtyvU3pKug44dDpSdc7Kn3mL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1724},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k5DPu9xITGbYkDsxUbp2lxJQatt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":496,"name":"poetry"},{"id":6342,"name":"nicaragua"},{"id":367978,"name":"ernesto cardenal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
