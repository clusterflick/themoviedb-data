To thank him for his heroic act, Jennifer invites him for dinner. She is impressed and smitten by Paul, who is charming if not a little odd, while a jealous Alex tries to overcompensate for failing to protect his wife. Little do they know, they’ve welcomed a con man into their lavish home; one who has been watching them with great envy. Deception, manipulation and seduction are on the menu, and when Paul’s intentions are made clear to Jennifer, he too will learn that nothing on the surface is as it seems.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6112,"logo_path":"/wWrRC80656YYP4QqRqcUkdb99xN.png","name":"Digital Playground","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lie With Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":4432005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gal Ritchie","original_name":"Gal Ritchie","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sDXJtiBQoFpqR7WcfzNc0NVsLhh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jennifer","credit_id":"6994ca9bfdefff70ec0661ee","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2218847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Quinton James","original_name":"Quinton James","popularity":2.93,"profile_path":"/f78I4MALst46RimD6vMiu8LCI5T.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"6994caa548c917cd226f7839","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":132144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Gamble","original_name":"Seth Gamble","popularity":12.937,"profile_path":"/seIGKzcFaz2iM7L5kvfhqb3csCi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"6994caac15b7cf79836f76e0","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AgqW5s5JKUgTkMImnYpvH3zc8GX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Release Episode 1: 1/22/26 | Release Episode 2: 1/29/26","release_date":"2026-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lie With Me (OFFICAL TRAILER)","key":"7aovTOsHdr4","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2026-01-24T18:15:01.000Z","id":"6994cc4b3440298deffa40cf"}]}}}
