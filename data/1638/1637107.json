Eight former refugees, born in Baghdad, Aleppo, Tripoli, Fez, Cairo, Aden and Sana’a tell how they were forced to flee as children or teenagers to Israel. They talk about how the atmosphere changed and how they were forced to travel (most illegally) by truck, boat or plane out of their countries of birth. Their stories are brought to life with animation and film clips rarely seen before. For several interviewees, the horrors of 7 October 2023 brought back memories of anti-Jewish violence and terror in Arab countries. The experiences they describe are more relevant than ever.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Forgotten Exodus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
