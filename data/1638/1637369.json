Out of options, she is sent to the office of unorthodox educator and coach, John Mahler. With his confrontational approach, Mahler tries to get to the heart of the matter, but is met with resistance. Alisa confesses to him that she doesn't want to attend these sessions, and that she wants to be left alone. Sensing that she has a good heart, John doesn't give up. Instead, he tries a variety of methods, determined to reform this bad girl from her wicked ways. Bad Girl Office is a feature that explores how two very different people can come together, how help and change is possible in a human being, and how a person can heal from the pain in their past.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Girl Office","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1733936,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jamie Grefe","original_name":"Jamie Grefe","popularity":0.4459,"profile_path":"/rRJGFenP6hoJsUnXeL9COayjLae.jpg","credit_id":"6994c75391f837c2d4fa420b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1733936,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jamie Grefe","original_name":"Jamie Grefe","popularity":0.4459,"profile_path":"/rRJGFenP6hoJsUnXeL9COayjLae.jpg","credit_id":"6994c78087060a016d125285","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregory Hatanaka","original_name":"Gregory Hatanaka","popularity":0.7624,"profile_path":"/w0YBj3TTEid5q2BZ6cwQLI2bQeq.jpg","credit_id":"6994c7929b3e30be806f7959","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
