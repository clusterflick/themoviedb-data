At a time when women were typically regarded as objects or madonnas to be represented in art, Sofonisba Anguissola (1532/5-1625) was something very different indeed: a highly respected painter and teacher who interacted with the likes of Michelangelo and Anthony van Dyck, and whose remarkable portraits were enthusiastically sought by many of the most powerful figures of the age.  The Chess Game by Sofonisba is a remarkable group portrait of three of her sisters and a maid. It is widely considered to be one of her most compelling and innovative artworks: a painting whose many subtle levels of meaning offer a fascinating window on Sofonisba, her family, and contemporary 16th-century values.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/99u9XhXlDtuN0Lq3jy0xOIuPn85.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sofonisba's Chess Game","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6013985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth van Sebelle","original_name":"Elizabeth van Sebelle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6994c9e258d265fdba851418","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3024313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Howard Burton","original_name":"Howard Burton","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6994c677a454af460912528d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39116633","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/99u9XhXlDtuN0Lq3jy0xOIuPn85.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":207257,"name":"renaissance painting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SOF - ENGLISH TRAILER - MAY 2","key":"1120131583","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-09-19T13:18:01.000Z","id":"6994c6c37cc3e7a75b2886ec"}]}}}
