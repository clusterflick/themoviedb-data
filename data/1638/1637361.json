What was supposed to be a high-stakes rehearsal for an upcoming gig quickly devolves into a chaotic clash of egos and existential dread. Between Ryder’s academic anxiety, Bimbo’s delusions of rockstar grandeur, and Ronnie’s questionable motivations for being in the band, the group is one wrong note away from a total implosion. As hours of failed songwriting turn into a floor littered with crumpled lyrics, the tension boils over into a full-scale meltdown. Exhausted and uninspired, the members must decide if they are just a fleeting distraction in each other's lives or if they have enough harmony left for one final performance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They came to play.
