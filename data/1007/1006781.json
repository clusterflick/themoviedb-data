Borzenko spent more than 80 fights and was never defeated, even though he was in terrible conditions, almost incompatible with life. The film shows the resilience and patriotism of specific people during the Great Patriotic War. The documentary film includes scenes from the life of the characters, played by the artists as a reconstruction of real events and supplemented with stories from relatives and friends of the main character.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/x80jkChKFU8sXLtTyOqvMnk87um.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119813,"logo_path":"/iyGJzcnWXZoNxYLzZu4jKzxIoFw.png","name":"Premier Studios","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Borzenko: Ring Behind Barbed Wire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3643984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Moshal-Geladze","original_name":"Elena Moshal-Geladze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e65bf1813cb600627ea02d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3643985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Degtyarev","original_name":"Alexey Degtyarev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e65bfef1b571005e2ad2d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":849,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x80jkChKFU8sXLtTyOqvMnk87um.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
