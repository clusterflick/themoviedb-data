The official government report said the object was simply a meteorite. But eyewitnesses to the event disagree. Some say they saw the object change direction and emit a vapor trail before crashing. Others claim to have seen the object up close. They describe it as a copper-colored acorn-shaped object with strange writing on it. Whatever crashed in Kecksburg, it quickly drew the attention of the U.S. military. They reportedly recovered the object, loaded it onto a flatbed truck and took it to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. What was it that caused the military to respond so quickly? What do they know that we don't?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hYiNWSaHvhG2nZzC7V2NOh3wQxJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132265,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grizzly Adams Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What Really Happened at Kecksburg?","title":"UFO Conspiracies: Kecksburg UFO Crash","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hYiNWSaHvhG2nZzC7V2NOh3wQxJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
