What was supposed to be a second chance turned into a lifetime of regret, pain and missed opportunities that deeply affected their journey to adulthood.  Fifty years on, Raphael, Peter and Manny reflect on their stolen childhood and how the sexual, emotional and physical abuse they experienced shaped their entire life. Through interviews and archive materials we will be transported back through their memories of abuse, homesickness and severed family ties. Their story unravels the historic failure of a scheme backed by two governments and the broken promises of the Catholic Organisation that received them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Would You Tell?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3642936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dery Sultana","original_name":"Dery Sultana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e5198fe86017005f3e53ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Q & A with director Dery Sultana, for his film: Who Would You Tell, screening at MDFF, July 2022.","key":"LMEkE71KhBk","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2022-06-21T09:05:14.000Z","id":"62e519cbbd588b0061ea7f7d"}]}}}
