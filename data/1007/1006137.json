Originally from England he set down roots in New Zealand where he found his happy place.  He established a Rock Climbers refuge originally born out of his kind heart and hospitality, and as a consequence, has left a legacy touching hearts and minds along the way. Willie Butler and Hangdog Camp are now both a part of New Zealand Folklore.
