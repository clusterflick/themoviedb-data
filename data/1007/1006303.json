The border established by the Treaty of Riga between pan-Poland and Soviet Belorussia passed through the estate of Polish Count Wadecki. The best part of the estate with the palace ended up on Soviet territory. From that moment on, the count lost peace and sleep. New owners - a noisy, cheerful pioneer squad - took up residence in the former manor house. The count's servants, shepherd boy Vasya and servant girl Yadya, watch the life of their neighbours with keen interest. Having accidentally crossed the border in search of a stray cow, Vasya happily stays in Soviet Belarus. He is followed by Yadia. Eventually the Count and his \"lordly\" guests cannot bear the sight of the noisy youth festivities on the Soviet side and flee. Yadia and Vasil participate in the Soviet youth party.","popularity":0.147,"poster_path":"/6KeEbqbS4hfsyoljVfI5c59OSi1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68613,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belgoskino","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1929-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gentleman and the Rooster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Петухи перекликаются","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3642528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonid Dobrovolsky","original_name":"Leonid Dobrovolsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Count Vadetskiy","credit_id":"62e47a6d9f51af00624cfe7b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1871977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Baranova","original_name":"Valentina Baranova","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jadia","credit_id":"62e47a5e4f9a99005b4b7b06","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1540571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Volyntseva","original_name":"Elena Volyntseva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Countess Vadetskaya","credit_id":"62e47a934f9a99006d349093","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1938046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirill Gun","original_name":"Kirill Gun","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Janek","credit_id":"62e47a7afd4a960058dcf53b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stepan Kuznetsov","original_name":"Степан Кузнецов","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/xzfqNJMFOrCUnIfmASo8HSGQKjn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vasya","credit_id":"62e47a894f9a99005b4b7b30","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5007596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgiy Radelin","original_name":"Georgiy Radelin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"The cook","credit_id":"671241268e844657b7fb130c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3642533,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dolgopolsky I.","original_name":"Dolgopolsky I.","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e47d149f51af005f917185","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158663,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Vladimir Ballyuzek","original_name":"Vladimir Ballyuzek","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/kpg8SroYhhUxfIfIcbBCYXzLarI.jpg","credit_id":"62e47cf846e75f006ed84664","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1926620,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leonid Iyerikhonov","original_name":"Leonid Iyerikhonov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e47d353acd200063471133","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1721693,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikolay Kozlovsky","original_name":"Nikolay Kozlovsky","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67123fb825c70b8b1d67b0c8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1075579,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Arkadi Koltsaty","original_name":"Аркадий Кольцатый","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67123fc125c70b8b1d67b0d1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158663,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Vladimir Ballyuzek","original_name":"Vladimir Ballyuzek","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/kpg8SroYhhUxfIfIcbBCYXzLarI.jpg","credit_id":"67123fda8e844657b7fb1281","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1309686,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Vladimir Egorov","original_name":"Vladimir Egorov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dhB2oCX8iJwIURRQCLfa0ZHy96T.jpg","credit_id":"67123fe498f6a758cd54af17","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11886328","wikidata_id":"Q17043504","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6KeEbqbS4hfsyoljVfI5c59OSi1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
