Curly is attracted to his boss's niece, Mina, but also realizes that Adolf and his cohort, Kurz, plan to blow up a troop train. Curly kills the two saboteurs and saves the train, but he is jailed by the abusive Sheriff Herman Lindig. Although Mina praises Curly for saving the soldiers' lives, he is sentenced to death and is denied a pardon from the governor. After the case attracts national attention, the governor explains that he prolonged Curly's incarceration to draw attention to the danger of German propaganda.","popularity":0.1296,"poster_path":"/bKZVqk7yLJRMFThXGNz5PGcJYSz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179595,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edgar Lewis Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love and the Law","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glen White","original_name":"Glen White","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/5PeXedRE3q45pu2gdGsWNhJVGJJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Karl 'Curly' Casterline","credit_id":"62e3e779df857c005a88f5fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Hill","original_name":"Josephine Hill","popularity":0.0754,"profile_path":"/ul8txb7F23KmzTaKd1hflI7qbOu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mina","credit_id":"62e3e78cc8a5ac005fb6897a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3641771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnold Storrer","original_name":"Arnold Storrer","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Kleinfeldt","credit_id":"62e3e79c66a0d3005ef4a347","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3641772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Ker","original_name":"Paul Ker","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Baudenistel","credit_id":"62e3e7b862f3350059eb9b09","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3641773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.T.
