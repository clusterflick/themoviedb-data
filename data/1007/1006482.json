To ensure Marie's silence, Sofia - leader of the gang - sabotages her parachute during an initiation. Marie falls 2,000 meters but miraculously survives. A year later, handicapped, she took refuge in her parents' house in Gap, her hometown. Until the day Marie meets Sofia, who thinks she is dead and does not recognize her. Marie decides to take revenge by luring them into a new robbery. But Luc Ferraz, a BRI officer looking for the source of the gang's information, is not to be trusted. Marie has the ideal profile.
