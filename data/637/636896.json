I Love You\", seven years after Holly's husband’s death with Holly having peacefully moved on with her life. However, when Holly’s sister asks her to tell the story of the “PS, I Love You” letters on her podcast — she does so reluctantly, not wanting to reopen old wounds. Soon after the episode airs, people start reaching out to Holly, and they all have one thing in common: they’re terminally ill and want to leave their own missives behind for loved ones. Suddenly, Holly finds herself drawn back into a world she’s worked tirelessly to leave behind — but one that leads her on another incredible, life-affirming journey.","popularity":0.4858,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1088,"logo_path":"/9WOE5AQUXbOtLU6GTwfjS8OMF0v.png","name":"Alcon Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":33681,"logo_path":"/dHx2nsV9AC7IBlKN2dk1FDImvOz.png","name":"Black Label Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":128975,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Blind Side","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Postscript","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Aladdin","type":"Abandomoviez.net (Spanish)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47284,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cecelia Ahern","original_name":"Cecelia Ahern","popularity":0.2057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4357b53dd1260018583d06","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thad Luckinbill","original_name":"Thad Luckinbill","popularity":1.084,"profile_path":"/7zBnpYTwwxKT6OHcycqacGQwQT8.jpg","credit_id":"5e4359539603310017f2214d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47285,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Broderick Johnson","original_name":"Broderick Johnson","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/lACnKu6Mxx5fGpWLt8qh0oevaQU.jpg","credit_id":"5e43591f41465c0016d06537","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47286,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew A.
