However Tess is reluctant to go: she fears the stormy waters and would rather stay at home for the summer with her best friend, Candice. Tess does go, and with her goes Maa-mou the cat, a parting gift from Candice, as her lively companion. Together they rise to the challenges of life on a fishing boat, and thrill in the summer's unexpected pleasures.","popularity":0.0721,"poster_path":"/vpBf31OED7ZDAmQPvhQ6SrczDoX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Reluctant Deckhand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Padgett","original_name":"Jan Padgett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d966b2429c626001c87a3f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0226373","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bDXuZ5tVKgWpsy390RF2t7CAoaZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vpBf31OED7ZDAmQPvhQ6SrczDoX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
