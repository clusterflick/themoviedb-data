Around the swimming pool, we get to know each tree, each grandchild that is born, each family celebration, which Antonio films painstakingly while adding a live narration. A film that pauses on the lyric of domestic life, at the same time as, through the past, it investigates a current theme: how what is around us is affected by constant recording, what does it mean to experience each event through the mediation of a device.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/pAhrhM8aERRlKYrYmQsjSqdpKXl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28016,"logo_path":"/zHoaupvjWluNcDZQYuOlVkEwotC.png","name":"Ecam","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2018-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los pilares","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucía Touceda","original_name":"Lucía Touceda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d95d7662c6b7b002393546c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Javier Moreno","original_name":"Javier Moreno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d95d774ea4263001294b40c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Negro","original_name":"Claudia Negro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d95d75a29c62600148716c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Vallejo","original_name":"Raúl Vallejo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d95d74a2c6b7b0023935407","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pAhrhM8aERRlKYrYmQsjSqdpKXl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
