What I find most intriguing is that people generally take the story to be a child's tale. For me, the film has always had an underlying darkness – an evil that runs deeper than the Wicked Witch and resides beneath the polished surface. In Once in a Lullaby, I strive to bring out this darkness and impart an altered version of Dorothy’s dream, which in this case is more of a beautiful nightmare. I recommend listening to it with a nice pair of headphones or versatile speakers.\"","popularity":0.0709,"poster_path":"/khfn0y8bGTh7PE8U584uSCz6vHs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once in a Lullaby","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2425558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joshua Minor","original_name":"Joshua Minor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d98cb8baaec71001a688259","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"L.
