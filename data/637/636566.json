The film is about women imprisoned and tortured during the Colonels’ dictatorship of 1967-1974. At the time, these womenwere in their twenties. Fifty women offer their testimonials. They all share the ethos of the women who took part in the National Resistance, and pursue the establishment of human dignity just as persistently. The “Girls of the Rain” consider themselves successors of those women. One of them said:“...we are their successors, just like the youth of today are our successors”. Remarkably, these are the words of a woman deprived by her torturers of the ability to have children.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/t7ds2sdZVhdAufP36B1q68GSBzf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girls of the Rain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2424642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alinta Dimitriou","original_name":"Αλίντα Δημητρίου","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/aW8cNPDpX9kNg5G2ZmRN6cE9b1c.jpg","credit_id":"5d970fe6ae26be001abdd64f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2424642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alinta Dimitriou","original_name":"Αλίντα Δημητρίου","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/aW8cNPDpX9kNg5G2ZmRN6cE9b1c.jpg","credit_id":"5d9712aeea426328929418ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2170607","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1171,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w28n7LsjrApZO4GnXQNYB7rbRIt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2082}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t7ds2sdZVhdAufP36B1q68GSBzf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"14th Thessaloniki Documentary Festival","release_date":"2012-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
