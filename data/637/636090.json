The film is a synthesis of collaged moving and still images taken directly from the Quay Brothers' 35mm films and recontextualized in order to metaphorically and responsively capture and reframe the Quay's films' qualities. The resultant richly textured and layered imagery delves the labyrinthine and secret realms of the Quay Brothers' world.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/muMA3akNlfvVYt2VCsF6XpJGqmG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadowy Encounters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gariné Torossian","original_name":"Gariné Torossian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d94baa2c8f85800122da9a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/muMA3akNlfvVYt2VCsF6XpJGqmG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
