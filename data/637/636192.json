It begins with a song of worship, an ode to the looming nastiness of our organic existence. A celebration of disorder and entropy, the opening song seems borne of a curiosity about the possibilities of joy and freedom. In a more lighthearted segment, a squirrel and beaver converse about how everybody feels bad a lot of the time, which is compounded by the stupid things they do as a result. By enjoying the spectacle of the river creaturesâ€™ conversation, we are guided through another chapter of anxiety about shame with the opportunity for impunity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Curious About Existence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cooper Battersby","original_name":"Cooper Battersby","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d95534429c6260014864589","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Vey Duke","original_name":"Emily Vey Duke","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d955360ea4263001293eef1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
