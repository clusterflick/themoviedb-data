All of his applications for naturalisation were refused on political grounds. In 1956 he fled Hungary, growing up in Switzerland with a Jewish father who had survived Auschwitz and Dachau.

It was this particular quality of his camerawork that proved fateful for him.","popularity":0.2527,"poster_path":"/itpZ0qhpF6gb8zBI4XLybB9CYAQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ariadnefilm GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Staatenlos -
