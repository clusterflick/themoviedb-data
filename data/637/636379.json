He was one of my mentors and a cherished friend. When this film was shown in Europe many years ago, someone called him the 'Charles Bronson of cats'. Dogs feared him, but with humans he was gentle. [...] A little girl awaits a school bus. A spider awaits its prey. Through it all, Bone, a feline Zen master, walks stolidly ahead, implying, perhaps, that there might be a means to resolve this, and we see him choose to balance himself and move on down the line, walking the path of the middle way.\" â€“Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/ll8DUDTA4sS1xJVoJVaapCDWLXV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catwalk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abbott Meader","original_name":"Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/6w2FYubuteabfg5UVNDEHraRTve.jpg","credit_id":"5d961bf83bd26e0022b68bb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10986152","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ll8DUDTA4sS1xJVoJVaapCDWLXV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"CATWALK (1972)","key":"352817054","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-08-08T22:21:52.000Z","id":"5e4758e82d93750017a53f9d"}]}}}
