Those awkward moments we've all had, and the emotions we all experience - rejection, romantic challenges, disappointment, wanting something more. It all takes place during a thought-provoking car ride home after a date. It follows a young gay professional, Simon; a frustrated hopeless romantic who's ready for something different. He's on the brink of giving up on the search for love; perhaps he's looking in the wrong places. With a little help from an unexpected source, he has a change in direction.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/l0PxFbmwUNHnknXfB6I65StwXia.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That's Me on the Right","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2423758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Young","original_name":"Justin Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d954ef22c6b7b0023926557","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8141018","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.612,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l0PxFbmwUNHnknXfB6I65StwXia.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":612}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
