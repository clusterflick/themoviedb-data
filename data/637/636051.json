The group of settlers includes the criminal Bush family. After a few days, the wagon trail meets the Pawnee Indian tribe, whose chief Weucha knows Natty and by whom the settlers are warmly received. On the onward journey, the Bush sons veer off to seemingly hunt but sell the Sioux weapons they had stolen from a fort before leaving. On the way back to the trek they are surprised by two hunting Pawnees. In the following fight, one of the Bush sons is killed. The archer is immediately shot, and the other Indian is supposed to be lynched in the camp of the whites. Chingachgook, however, cuts the rope with a bullet. Later, Father Ismael Bush incites the peaceful Pawnees and Sioux against each other by having a Sioux killed and leading suspicion to the Pawnees. The Sioux attack and destroy the Pawnee village.","popularity":0.2594,"poster_path":"/w140ud2iQK52VOSMNCfRhyQFZ38.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1969-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prairie","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hellmut Lange","original_name":"Hellmut Lange","popularity":0.243,"profile_path":"/v5vUYx7VX8yjNCIDuosmJBBsgqs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"634102d77eb5f2007b12d57d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Massimi","original_name":"Pierre Massimi","popularity":0.1091,"profile_path":"/nRBmC9BhGRnBbhDefRptb67SEUO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"634102e925b955007d71d1cc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Jourdan","original_name":"Catherine Jourdan","popularity":0.3034,"profile_path":"/mr5yVjt5haQghDSZ3lKeg4WPcdX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"634103087eb5f2008337cd66","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":44108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Benoît","original_name":"Robert Benoît","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6341032f25b955007d71d1de","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1751036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helmut Schneider","original_name":"Helmut Schneider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63410342dcf875008fc050cf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Gascon","original_name":"Gabriel Gascon","popularity":0.1328,"profile_path":"/AuCHEpZCgyNSgtncKGVb0YK8mvI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63410358cf62cd007b4ab078","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1161949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ion Dichiseanu","original_name":"Ion Dichiseanu","popularity":0.1708,"profile_path":"/nju92bPrWb65biWa4PB93jULYCX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"634103679c97bd00796ca476","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2529135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Demetru","original_name":"George Demetru","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6341037a9c97bd00796ca483","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Gaspard-Huit","original_name":"Pierre Gaspard-Huit","popularity":0.108,"profile_path":"/eQ8J923bNM2hM80S0CkZpWifbvm.jpg","credit_id":"6214f10c4284ea001ae0bf61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergiu Nicolaescu","original_name":"Sergiu Nicolaescu","popularity":0.281,"profile_path":"/z2qLrL7l2X7UZUd1UiSO6fxFPep.jpg","credit_id":"6214f1170cd44600692f3ccd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57450,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Fenimore Cooper","original_name":"James Fenimore Cooper","popularity":0.2596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661d980fd75bd6017c309d44","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0139538","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/w140ud2iQK52VOSMNCfRhyQFZ38.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":790,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fl7lM8pTFF436I3ab2klETIMb4I.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":554}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
