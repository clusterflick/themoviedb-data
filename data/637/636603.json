A fog, a bit harder than the air – the dust of stones.  A hexagonal structure, like a monolith of which one dare not ask questions.  Two hundred kilometres from Beijing I found a sculpture factory where men lived amidst rocks that were waiting to be broken, cut, polished.  The same gestures come back again and again to write a history of deterioration and repair.  This history is obliterated in the making of monuments. With the wind that inexorably scatters the traces of these actions.","popularity":0.0922,"poster_path":"/3HaSV4JDlKJq0tkzNF4Lsm1eB98.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11687,"logo_path":"/gW6YiDdhkySff27C0m4JXu30879.png","name":"Le Fresnoy","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Movements Should Kill the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2348780,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Éléonore Mallo","original_name":"Éléonore Mallo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d975901ae26be001abe1139","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1998282,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicolas Verhaeghe","original_name":"Nicolas Verhaeghe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d97591eae26be002bbe18c7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2424710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Yuyan","original_name":"Wang Yuyan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9758e0ae26be001abe1102","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286260,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Clara Chapus","original_name":"Clara Chapus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d97590cae26be002bbe18b6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1985038,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Natalia Trebik","original_name":"Natalia Trebik","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3b925246aed400346bc66e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2424710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Yuyan","original_name":"Wang Yuyan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3b925a2495ab0034d1afc7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2424710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Yuyan","original_name":"Wang Yuyan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3b92441fb94f0036ad3dcc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12517644","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wxdN8iMUehlVKAepg3iLxEqO7Ox.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3HaSV4JDlKJq0tkzNF4Lsm1eB98.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2362,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o63E8GkdlImt2BP4rab81A0rTjB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1771}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Champs-Élysées Film Festival","release_date":"2020-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2020-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New Holland Island International Debut Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"All Movements Should Kill the Wind – trailer | IFFR 2020","key":"6T6MTTkyxrg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-01-15T13:15:20.000Z","id":"5f3b92c929c626003585e520"}]}}}
