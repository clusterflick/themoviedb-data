The film begins with word fragments written on the leader. There is sound, and the leader then lets there be light. Soon animal life appears on the earth, followed by people – and at some point, civilization and culture appear by way of a cast off TV set.  Life continues as other events occur, and Time continually presses onward toward night. Throughout the film, we hear cryptic voices whose messages are unclear, and, as darkness descends and the TV set dominates, one voice from the ether constantly repeats a phrase. The sound is blurry, and as with a Rorschach test image, you will make of it what your inner life hears. I, of course, know exactly what the voice says, because I am the creator. But you will believe your own ears. (Spoiler alert. It’s in English). That’s the way of the world, and there’s no way out of it as far as I know.\" –Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/4NnkWkROQnuK01kT4VXLJ6uYKlF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Destroying Angel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abbott Meader","original_name":"Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/6w2FYubuteabfg5UVNDEHraRTve.jpg","credit_id":"5d961b543bd26e0011b69cc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10986400","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4NnkWkROQnuK01kT4VXLJ6uYKlF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Destroying Angel (1969)","key":"353017869","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-08-09T20:57:44.000Z","id":"5e4979842d93750015a853d2"}]}}}
