The title refers to Siva/Shiva – god of the dance – who dances the world into both destruction and rebirth, and Charivari, pronounced 'Shivaree', a rude serenade to mock wedding couples -i.e. mocking the concept of passion in balance with serenity. The film’s dancing child is our daughter Jennifer, now a middle aged school teacher and a likely Bodhisattva. She dances to escape and dispel the fragmentary seductions of TV, with its chaos of sound and image. Moving toward a window and the light, she sees and ponders the wind in the trees, as the final notes of Bill Evans’ 'Peace Piece' linger and fade.\" –Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0807,"poster_path":"/fJLJxGbJruoBzAIbbTRa4vJm1fR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shiva Ree","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abbott Meader","original_name":"Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/6w2FYubuteabfg5UVNDEHraRTve.jpg","credit_id":"5d961ae92c6b7b001b938410","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11000424","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fJLJxGbJruoBzAIbbTRa4vJm1fR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SHIVA REE (1968)","key":"142727174","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-10-17T14:11:48.000Z","id":"5e4978d435811d0013484a38"}]}}}
