An intimate family story emerges during the investigation into the reasons for the separation. Hinging on the subtle and touching testimonies of the family members, the film delves into complex interrelationships. Actors bring the family's memories alive as if they were their own. The result is a chronicle of a family drama, which the real protagonists complement and comment on – a reflection on the mechanisms and dynamics shaping and directing their family life over the years.","popularity":0.1848,"poster_path":"/2MtsYqoqosTnW5aZJTnJfpdQZ6o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zürcher Hochschule der Künste ZHdK Departement Darstellende Künste und Film","origin_country":""},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2015-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family Fragments","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalie Pfister","original_name":"Natalie Pfister","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b1474cf9ba3007d80157f","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":557705,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anita Wasser","original_name":"Anita Wasser","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/z1tOyvuP4lMy0dN3OcPO47ZPaVW.jpg","credit_id":"632b148ea3b5e6007a2036aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2524360,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dieter Meyer","original_name":"Dieter Meyer","popularity":0.069,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b15386af9dd007fc70646","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2165608,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Simon Bitterli","original_name":"Simon Bitterli","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b14f56ca9a00082979a4d","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2165608,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Simon Bitterli","original_name":"Simon Bitterli","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b14a9ecbde9007e155c9a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3709762,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Markus Egloff","original_name":"Markus Egloff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b1524cf9ba3008235e462","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1040881,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ruth Hirschfeld","original_name":"Ruth Hirschfeld","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":"/mUfn7RQFOoYTUoMTP55fFBNNBvC.jpg","credit_id":"632b15d139b6c3009e9a9e19","department":"Production","job":"Casting"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286843,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gregg Skermann","original_name":"Gregg Skermann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b14dbef9d72009219c8eb","department":"Sound","job":"Recording Supervision"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285682,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annette Brütsch","original_name":"Annette Brütsch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b14bf39b6c3009e9a9dcf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalie Pfister","original_name":"Natalie Pfister","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d95d6fd3bd26e0019b65d3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":723,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/45y8Uu0qB7cwRLjikw2zyr87QZ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1285}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2MtsYqoqosTnW5aZJTnJfpdQZ6o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1129}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":303226,"name":"artfilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
