This film tells the story of four Hollywood directors of European origin, who returned to the \"Old World\" during the Second World War to make propaganda documentaries for the US Army at the front: William Wyler from Alsace, Frank Capra from Italy, Anatole Litvak from Ukraine and - in post-war Germany - Billy Wilder from Austria.","popularity":0.3985,"poster_path":"/A4fglqNkvhNrAdTeTiS0AhBl0dr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62277,"logo_path":null,"name":"Global Screen","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1775,"logo_path":"/ilL857W1zhtnudzvdlxrjIqLAvs.png","name":"Radio Bremen","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Florianfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hollywood's Second World War","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Hollywood's World War II","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Hollywoods II.
