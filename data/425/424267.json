Conducted by Andrea Marcon, this was, in the words of Opera News, “musically … a performance of the highest festival level”. The production of Alcina, by the British director Katie Mitchell, was welcomed by the Financial Times as “meticulously executed …, rich in detail, consummately polished”. As the New York Times wrote: “It involves a huge sorcery machine for turning people into animals (or whatever). And Ms. Mitchell works magic of her own onstage, constantly showing the enchantresses Alcina and Morgana alternating between glamorous public personas and their ‘real life’, older, private selves …There are also bits of simulated sex, mingling genders and suggesting, among other things, inventive new ways to hit high notes.”","popularity":0.1022,"poster_path":"/mcD80wdpPm6jfGLtglAc1a2vBRP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78036,"logo_path":null,"name":"Erato","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":187,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handel: Alcina","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1071257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Petibon","original_name":"Patricia Petibon","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Alcina","credit_id":"581bdca4c3a3682a00000d35","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Jaroussky","original_name":"Philippe Jaroussky","popularity":0.1087,"profile_path":"/7xgiiRWKSqS05p7RtbOc4y0SVzP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ruggiero","credit_id":"581bdccd9251412e68000f48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1566103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Prohaska","original_name":"Anna Prohaska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Morgana","credit_id":"581bdcf39251412e68000f7c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1703853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katarina Bradic","original_name":"Katarina Bradic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bradamante","credit_id":"581bdd12c3a3682d6e000ccb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Gregory","original_name":"Anthony Gregory","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Oronte","credit_id":"581bdd33c3a36829870010b4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krysztof Baczyk","original_name":"Krysztof Baczyk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Melisso","credit_id":"581bdd4c9251411199002214","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elias Mädler","original_name":"Elias Mädler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Oberto","credit_id":"581bdd639251412e68000fed","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Marcon","original_name":"Andrea Marcon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"581bdd7cc3a3682d2d0010db","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georg Friedrich Händel","original_name":"Georg Friedrich Händel","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/7vbMm0VcHE0vTlaU9BTLqILenM0.jpg","credit_id":"581be20b925141120700235c","department":"Crew","job":"Compositors"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":155884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katie Mitchell","original_name":"Katie Mitchell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"581be1e4c3a3682c9d00134d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9037,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"François Duplat","original_name":"François Duplat","popularity":0.0832,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"581be26dc3a3682a00001211","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2460459,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonio Marchi","original_name":"Antonio Marchi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd15e6d2d531a0015da8a05","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mcD80wdpPm6jfGLtglAc1a2vBRP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
