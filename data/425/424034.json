Toss in Mark Plant---next seen on film years later---as an master-of-ceremonies dressed (or undressed as the case may be) like Tarzan. First act in this zoo is The Nagasake Tramp Band (all black performers)who do a couple of novelty instrument specialties, followed by Ruth Daye (aka Ruth Day) who does a tap dance that leaves Leo and the other audience lions roaring. Schwartzwald, never one not to know how to change the pace, then brings on The Ashburns, who trip through some ballroom dancing. Singer Evelyn Poe picks the pace back up with a hot-swing number. Evidently, on the premise that if one novelty band is good then two should be twice as good, The Kidoodlers make their entrance.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rhapsody in Zoo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1427864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Poe","original_name":"Evelyn Poe","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/ng3FZu4nGV5Q6dFkgCG4sexUoNZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"582c9021c3a3683e3f0000c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1709674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Plant","original_name":"Mark Plant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"582c902f92514178020000e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1709675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Day","original_name":"Ruth Day","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"582c904dc3a3683e490000f9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":566088,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Milton Schwarzwald","original_name":"Milton Schwarzwald","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5819bb9d92514133ae0054a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0175116","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
