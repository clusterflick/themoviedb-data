In ULTIMA THULE, gravity fails, land and sky lose their historical meaning. A small silver plane navigates an ultramarine storm, flying over barely-glimpsed hills, an unlikely ferry to ”Ultima Thule”: the farthest point north, the limit of any journey. The seduction of immersion in blue is too strong to avoid, the land fills with water, and time loses its line.","popularity":0.4058,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ultima Thule","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098988,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leon Rothenberg","original_name":"Leon Rothenberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206b4df38e510006a54af63","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janie Geiser","original_name":"Janie Geiser","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/1rgqjWeJNfuOqCTWax9hg2VMQXD.jpg","credit_id":"581e1df89251410a0e00c8e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0361076","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14527,"name":"storm"},{"id":180799,"name":"navigation"},{"id":224230,"name":"collage film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":292471,"name":"flying plane"},{"id":292472,"name":"point north"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"2002-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ultima Thule (excerpts)","key":"178573160","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2016-08-12T07:04:15.000Z","id":"6206b3f8d7fbda0044e020b9"}]}}}
