Dramatic recreations reveal the untold, behind-the-scenes moments that shaped the trajectory of his career. Interviews and rare archival material illustrate his life through the Great Depression, WWII, Hollywood’s Golden Age, The Cold War, an assassination attempt (not unlike Bill O’Reilly’s book and recent Nat Geo movie, Killing Reagan), and public and personal heartache.","popularity":0.469,"poster_path":"/ksyLeG3kRCvRjrT4G76vlgflStI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reagan: From Movie Star to President","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1155479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Bailey","original_name":"Matt Bailey","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Max Arnow","credit_id":"5a464b05c3a3685844076721","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.W.
