Workers at “The Steel” forged most of the New York City skyline — including the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings. In addition to the Golden Gate Bridge and armaments for WWII. The plant was recently demolished to make way for the Sands Casino (owned by Sheldon Adelson). Starting in 1997, a group of artists who share a mission and obsession, have been collaborating and sneaking into the abandoned plant to explore &amp; document before much of it was lost to redevelopment and time. A combination of Super 8, 16mm, video and stills, this short film is part of a larger project.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bethlehem Steel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jesse Erica Epstein","original_name":"Jesse Erica Epstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"581f8d3792514168ad003de9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
