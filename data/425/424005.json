She tires valiantly to run them off but they outsmart her. She makes a phone call and Cubby appears at her door. The mice make quick work of him too. Only a fat cat is able to temporarily stop them but they soon turn on him too. Cubby comes to the aide of the cat but the mice outsmart the both of them. In the end the mice have run off the cat, Honey is gone, and Cubby sits dazed on the floor as the mice cheer their victory.","popularity":0.1072,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Van Beuren Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mischievous Mice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudolf Ising","original_name":"Rudolf Ising","popularity":0.0903,"profile_path":"/mPcWz8CHJTftnY4QRmpJRmw07Bm.jpg","credit_id":"5819a02392514133a2004c5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112993,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hugh Harman","original_name":"Hugh Harman","popularity":0.3973,"profile_path":"/6aVWLy6yqpN8OdrkLzH3LeUcO2N.jpg","credit_id":"5819a014c3a3680958004b77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10695260","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1934-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
