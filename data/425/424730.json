Despite her intentions to stay alone, however, Naomi quickly makes two unexpected connections- one with a musically gifted Ultra-Orthodox young boy who lives in her building and the other, with Fabrizio, a charismatic Italian monk and organist. While these relationships allow Naomi to reconnect with her love of music and sense of meaning, they also make her a target in her new community. Faced with escalating isolation and violence, Naomi must learn to use music as a bridge to overcome towering religious barriers.","popularity":0.1774,"poster_path":"/1zFMsT8Z7pzqdfTjuu8tw8NXUQ5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39719,"logo_path":"/fwymnjt9qfiUVi2m820nNbJLV1M.png","name":"Green Productions","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2016-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Quiet Heart","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Lev shaket meod","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":77645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ania Bukstein","original_name":"אניה בוקשטיין","popularity":0.2448,"profile_path":"/eqpwVZS1g3lhE2REbY0G96Hrvsg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Naomi","credit_id":"581fbf44c3a36855500070f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1705242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uri Gottlieb","original_name":"Uri Gottlieb","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/aT3DoMNrOtoqSaWVqES2im3n9jG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Traffic Inspector","credit_id":"581fbf45c3a3685563005fb0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giorgio Lupano","original_name":"Giorgio Lupano","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":"/slSK1CFNtg3Vmaf7zVrHu8FllIM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Fabrizio","credit_id":"581fbf4592514168a70078b0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119297,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ludi Boeken","original_name":"Ludi Boeken","popularity":0.2187,"profile_path":"/pXtrxvMUzI5Aah7q2XFrDhGssxl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"581fbf79c3a368554d00786f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1011142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rona-Lee Shim'on","original_name":"Rona-Lee Shim'on","popularity":0.2487,"profile_path":"/tsbVNfgRukCyPEVog2bIhcOSJWx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"581fbf80c3a368555b006caa","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":235135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irit Kaplan","original_name":"Irit Kaplan","popularity":1.902,"profile_path":"/jsdmzaTQdySijks7zicxB5YGACK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jehudit","credit_id":"581fbf8992514168aa00778c","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1623294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoav Levi","original_name":"Yoav Levi","popularity":1.646,"profile_path":"/vWlgMVcAkrby7bUA1o8TEmq5mle.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"581fbf8f92514168aa007792","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":80898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eitan Anner","original_name":"Eitan Anner","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"581f706792514168b6001ab3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1507334,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Moshe Mishali","original_name":"Moshe Mishali","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"581f707892514168af001c3e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":80898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eitan Anner","original_name":"Eitan Anner","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"581f70a5c3a3685553001ef7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5907852","wikidata_id":"Q52837147","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5LfD6cqIhtImgXWnzKLm8Fy14PQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1774,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/icUbTOKwTx3Zntubmc0SDZdlmf7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1236},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1zFMsT8Z7pzqdfTjuu8tw8NXUQ5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1196,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/iiIDKVoMlYOQaWKLocDIoBiWpIg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":798},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/2XgQcrvpADvtBqMjnlyTMXlSfrf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Israeli Film Academy","release_date":"2016-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
