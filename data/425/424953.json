She is a xenophobic and violent person, her life has always been filled with hate towards those who don’t share the same physical or cultural features; chiefly immigrants and muslims. Her job during the summer is to guard the beach and pick up the corpses of illegal immigrants who have drowned off-shore in their desperate attempt to reach the coast earning petty cash for each body. It’s a lucrative business so she has to face the competition of many illegal corpse-collectors. Nahiri, a Tunisian man, is one of them. He works with a group of illegal immigrants, who snatches the corpses from Caina and sells them in the black market. In order to increase their profit, it is not rare that they drown those who survived but are too weak to fight for their lives. It’s a ruthless business in which, sometimes, the opposites attract.","popularity":0.1464,"poster_path":"/iISAv0SbaztWlxfvlm7waoyjdsa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Déjà vu production","origin_country":""},{"id":106256,"logo_path":null,"name":"Movieland Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Adapted, at first into a theatre play, and now into a film from Davide Morgante’s book by the same name,","title":"Caina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luisa Amatucci","original_name":"Luisa Amatucci","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":"/AcPlbwjLRc8ZTvJqJgrFcMh1TzN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b3a08fc0e0a2663710039f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1014911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isa Danieli","original_name":"Isa Danieli","popularity":0.2028,"profile_path":"/xUETwTcqaEdc4jEO5JzZBxbrGsA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b3a0902c3a3684561011b96","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helmi Dridi","original_name":"Helmi Dridi","popularity":0.1623,"profile_path":"/9YqiEkO9GJyS2Fsl8KGxlT1jxhE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b3a0912c3a36846b800b768","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadia Kibout","original_name":"Nadia Kibout","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/10JOWubIV4g5Ak2u0iz3UtCYTju.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b3a091c9251415efd00dcbe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Porfito","original_name":"Mario Porfito","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/6spG6nU5TXRyU89fYqRjdYQwV9q.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5b3a09220e0a265267003b2d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705625,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Davide Morganti","original_name":"Davide Morganti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5820e370925141206e001aa2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303454,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stefano Amatucci","original_name":"Stefano Amatucci","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5820e3189251412071001b1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303454,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stefano Amatucci","original_name":"Stefano Amatucci","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5820e3649251412068001bf4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721079,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roberta Allegrini","original_name":"Roberta Allegrini","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3a09640e0a266371003a23","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":64801,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rocco Marra","original_name":"Rocco Marra","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3a09729251413c9d03c79c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6180106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iISAv0SbaztWlxfvlm7waoyjdsa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2362,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/3gPMw8ZV8tw7VKGHEQfZ7yXTmXM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1575}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Geelong International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
