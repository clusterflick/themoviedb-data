Skillfully edited, the picture captures a panorama of international events centered on the labor movement. Scenes include Mussolini, Hitler and FDR preparing for war, Nazi soldiers persecuting German Jews, a political strike in Paris, the Scottsboro demonstration in Washington, DC, police violence against striking steelworkers in Pennsylvania and union members stopping scab workers from delivering milk during a dairy farmers strike in Wisconsin. Under the direction of pioneering documentarian Leo Hurwitz, the images are edited together to create a powerful image of a world that, in his view, desperately needed radical change.","popularity":0.3474,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":82991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Workers Film and Photo League","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America Today","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"America Today / World in Review","type":"Alternate"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The World in Review","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Hurwitz","original_name":"Leo Hurwitz","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/mk3yshXb2ZMUSeV6DLc0BhuA29.jpg","credit_id":"5faff87f5ed962003e100a46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18268690","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1755,"name":"fascism"},{"id":33585,"name":"labor"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1934-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
