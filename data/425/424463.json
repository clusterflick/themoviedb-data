Yvonne, the owner of the café, serves small red wine glasses to cards players, sells bread, grinds pepper, finds the right word, the phrase that saves the day.

A sad customer smiles again. Sometimes it is the bar as a whole that exults. It is no coincidence: \"All those who enter here deserve it! \"However, on the road, cars go at full speed, indifferent.  Seashells and witticisms to taste. The sea is not far. Poetry either.
