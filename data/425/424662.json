Yet within a day fever took over black swellings the size of baseballs appeared on the neck and finally a highly contagious bloody cough quickly sealed the victim's fate. During the worst biological disaster in the history of mankind the so-called black death released an indiscriminate fury which shook the very foundations of human order. Religious hysteria began to break out and in desperation frenzied masses scrambled to find a scapegoat. When all was said and done nearly one-third of Europe's population had been completely wiped out and devastated survivors were left to contend with a world forever changed both socially and economically. In this feature-length special THE HISTORY CHANNEL-Â® investigates the origins of this devastating moment in human history and explores the many questions surrounding the terrifying possibility of a modern-day biological threat.","popularity":0.402,"poster_path":"/faAYMO8DZaGlGrdapdN5T0DufDw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"},{"id":121260,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gardner Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Plague","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":92526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Mercurio","original_name":"Sam Mercurio","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"63511fa85f4b73007b848ebd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Aberth","original_name":"John Aberth","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63511f21a0f1a20079629eba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly DeVries","original_name":"Kelly DeVries","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63511f2c076ce80091764824","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Gage","original_name":"Ken Gage","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63511f36c99826007ddc1c79","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Johnson","original_name":"Richard Johnson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63511f75a843c10091b1e1a7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Kelly","original_name":"John Kelly","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63511f7e076ce8007a51b790","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Mooney","original_name":"Graham Mooney","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63511f87c998260082974f2a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Ann Moran Cruz","original_name":"Jo Ann Moran Cruz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63511f91be4b36009c6301f8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2485173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Nirenberg","original_name":"David Nirenberg","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63511f9c84448e007a5ca86f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1258025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert H.
