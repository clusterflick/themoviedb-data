The cartoon half of this entry has a slot-machine player cheating the machines in a penny-arcade by tying a string to the coin and pulling it out again. The machines get rather animated about being cheated and the petty-gambler receives some rough treatment. The second half is about four minutes of music from Jay Freeman and his band, featuring Johnny Russell as the vocalist.","popularity":0.0627,"poster_path":"/3Jv4ltEeWwQqbs2XDlHoLq0oWp5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleischer Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magic on Broadway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1702917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Freeman","original_name":"Jay Freeman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jay Freeman - Bandleader","credit_id":"5819c24992514133a8005a06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5151506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Russell","original_name":"Johnny Russell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Band Singer","credit_id":"677475926234c1b46f618045","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Fleischer","original_name":"Dave Fleischer","popularity":0.3152,"profile_path":"/wSsZ2FuFstd6Ed0D6h94TwYlVuq.jpg","credit_id":"5819c22ec3a368095c00511c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0029187","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Jv4ltEeWwQqbs2XDlHoLq0oWp5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
