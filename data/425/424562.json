The interviews all take place in a studio, where the goal was to place the interviewees in a sort of job interview situation. The interviewees have many different nationalities and backgrounds and were subjected to a litany of questions covering the themes of work, art, satisfaction, wishes, creativity, study and their personal life situations. The goal was not to build a personal profile of each individual, but rather to present a forum to discuss each of the questions.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Artists","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1704537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Ullerich","original_name":"Susanne Ullerich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"581e36d8c3a36806f900df80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
