They filmed the workers of the state-owned fishing concern in Warnemünde and a brigade of crane operators at the state Warnow dockyards. Just two years later, East Germany was history, including most of the jobs it once provided. Twenty-five years later, in 2014, the filmmakers returned to an utterly different Rostock. They visited the people they had filmed in 1987. Together, documentarians and subjects look at excerpts from the earlier film, and talk about the enormous changes the men and women experienced, how they dealt with them, and how they feel today.","popularity":0.2817,"poster_path":"/nfAf0nXSAZxO6eObLiiQypslGyF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moving Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Us to Me","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"From Us To Me","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3572464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl-Heinz Ruschau","original_name":"Karl-Heinz Ruschau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6297debad48cee2c45c58719","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2269033,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ellin Hare","original_name":"Ellin Hare","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6297de9c7e12f0004f472792","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16744250","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nfAf0nXSAZxO6eObLiiQypslGyF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/7Mf117fmmLcVEKdZ2ITq3VZ48U3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1772,"name":"german democratic republic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"58.
