Through steep mountain paths, pouring rain, and sticky mud, the glorious adventure takes him beyond the barriers of his own consciousness, facing hidden fears, pain and exhaustion. Tо the point where he has to make a tough choice – to quit or to push his will to the ultimate challenge, beyond his own limitations.","popularity":0.3742,"poster_path":"/pkMkbQEfvMW4uuGjZqKXSZtrO9v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83117,"logo_path":null,"name":"xco publishing
