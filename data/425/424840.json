'Waterloo' presents a tale of several people involved in the final battle. Napoleon and Wellington, of course, but also the Austrian general Blutcher (who is seen as a ladies' man - his scene with a flirty Countess about halfway through the film is priceless; as are his touching scenes with his plain wife (who he imagines to be a young and nubile girl when they get romantic) and some people within his regiment. Not simply a film of war, 'Waterloo' is a story of people, of lovers, of lost opportunities.","popularity":0.1424,"poster_path":"/owet8s5GmkGLh6O2uMfsZf1znLv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waterloo","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1368152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles
