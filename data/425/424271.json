Dmitri Tcherniakov duly revisits the myth and makes the seducer of Seville a ‘man without qualities’, a cipher whose words have a hypnotic power over women. His words will disrupt the proprieties ruling the Commandatore’s family. His words are also what makes Don Juan such a subversive figure and the embodiment of one of the most powerful modern European myths. Leading the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra is one of the best Mozart conductors, Louis Langrée. Bo Skovhus portrays a dispirited Don Giovanni, old playboy and anti-hero. Kyle Ketelsen is his servant Leporello, currently a shoe-in for this rôle. The superb female trio is composed of Marlis Petersen (Donna Anna), Kristine Opolais (Elvira) and Kerstin Avemo (Zerlina).","popularity":0.1852,"poster_path":"/vpGDbYZyo0QqEHC1bhOPEj2IeTl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34577,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bel Air Classique","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":182,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart: Don Giovanni","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bo Skovhus","original_name":"Bo Skovhus","popularity":0.1043,"profile_path":"/wK6k0oyZlMJLqLM9Ew2sQHdgtCO.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Don Giovanni","credit_id":"581be7519251412ed70019b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyle Ketelsen","original_name":"Kyle Ketelsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Leporello","credit_id":"581be76ec3a3682c9d001865","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1560771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlis Petersen","original_name":"Marlis Petersen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/juOFmeaDnu7el7F0UqtlkdNQ8ac.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Donna Anna","credit_id":"581be7959251411199002c11","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1569376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristine Opolais","original_name":"Kristine Opolais","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/zGHyp1MR6JBocvZin7RK0GESfiR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Donna Elvira","credit_id":"581be7ad9251412e680019f8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Balzer","original_name":"Colin Balzer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Don Ottavio","credit_id":"581be7cdc3a3682c86001c19","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kerstin Avemo","original_name":"Kerstin Avemo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Zerlina","credit_id":"581be7ec9251411199002c6e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1703866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bizic","original_name":"David Bizic","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/9D16nvANROErXnXykwrBUF6GlRX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Masetto","credit_id":"581be821c3a3682a0000171b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anatoli Kotscherga","original_name":"Anatoli Kotscherga","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/rWsTcIoYHCNUFqO9A0nke3SblKM.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Il Commandatore","credit_id":"581be83fc3a3682d6e00172a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Langrée","original_name":"Louis Langrée","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"581be85cc3a3682987001c27","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"637aca25fab3fa00aace8451","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmitri Tcherniakov","original_name":"Dmitri Tcherniakov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/42uxTZ5tUwRmgFMT7jrWlKcKQOr.jpg","credit_id":"581bea7cc3a3682987001e4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233456,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lorenzo da Ponte","original_name":"Lorenzo da Ponte","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/mM38EiXvY2Oi7cLrvXdT6j0S2aa.jpg","credit_id":"581beaa69251412e68001cfd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1029,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vpGDbYZyo0QqEHC1bhOPEj2IeTl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
