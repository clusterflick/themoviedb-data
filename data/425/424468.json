Bourque buried random out-takes from her first three films (all staged productions dealing with her family) in the backyard of her ancestral home (adjoining the grounds of a former cemetery) with the ambivalent intentions of both safe-keeping and unloading them (she was relocating). Upon examining the footage five years later she found that the material contained images of herself captured during the making of her first film. That discovery seemed handed over like a gift and prompted the making of this film, a metaphysical pas-de-deux in which decay undermines the image and in the process engenders a transmutation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/z2vOp86YvsTw1YcvWcMOvWW9S1R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2002-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self Portrait Post Mortem","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1704409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Bourque","original_name":"Louise Bourque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/swhC9xEcY3VixSVz4R5D0uRFrsp.jpg","credit_id":"581dd5f3c3a36806f90093b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1704409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Bourque","original_name":"Louise Bourque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/swhC9xEcY3VixSVz4R5D0uRFrsp.jpg","credit_id":"5d370955ab684974f58568f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1704409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Bourque","original_name":"Louise Bourque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/swhC9xEcY3VixSVz4R5D0uRFrsp.jpg","credit_id":"5d37096cab684974f585690d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1704409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Bourque","original_name":"Louise Bourque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/swhC9xEcY3VixSVz4R5D0uRFrsp.jpg","credit_id":"5d37097ae54d5d0013db925f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z2vOp86YvsTw1YcvWcMOvWW9S1R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
