Dakota flushes and replies half angrily that he has never seen the parson's girl and don't ever want to. However that afternoon Daisy goes to the saloon and invites Dakota to attend church. Dakota refuses her invitation. Daisy tells him she will make a bargain with him to tend his bar for five minutes if he will go to church the next day. Dakota is slightly startled, but he admires her grit and accepts the challenge. Daisy goes behind the bar. The men line up and she is about to serve a fresh guy when he suddenly reaches over and kisses her. Dakota immediately knocks him \"cold,\" and, ashamed of his bargain with Daisy, grimly escorts her to the door. The next day he tells the men that if they don't accompany him to church he will close.","popularity":0.2012,"poster_path":"/fhqBOQjeQzq6v8bx1L8KOBWDU0W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80384,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broncho Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tools of Providence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Every Inch a Man","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William S.
