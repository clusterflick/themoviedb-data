Inspired by the writings of Lebanese writer Amin Maalouf, Shawky’s film trilogy explores the horrors of the medieval holy wars in the Middle-East – from an Arab perspective. With a cast made up entirely of puppets, the third part, The Secrets of Karbala (2014), centres on the period between the 7th and 12th centuries, covering the crusades as well as a dispute between two Islamic sects. Beautifully made of handblown Murano glass, the puppets have amazing expressive power, making the scenes full of violence, repression and torture all the more awe-inspiring.","popularity":0.4268,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":77929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":77930,"logo_path":null,"name":"Qatar Museums Authority","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The crusades from an Arab perspective, played by puppets.","title":"Cabaret Crusades: The Secrets of Karbala","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1633303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aida Fahmy","original_name":"Aida Fahmy","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/sHHb7tFdcAViGodcknnmODIYcyU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"575a95df92514176db0008dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1633303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aida Fahmy","original_name":"Aida Fahmy","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/sHHb7tFdcAViGodcknnmODIYcyU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"575a95ed9251411548001704","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahmoud Masaoud","original_name":"Mahmoud Masaoud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"575a95f49251411548001707","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khaled ElZahaby","original_name":"Khaled ElZahaby","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"575a960cc3a3686bcf00095d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adel Khalaf","original_name":"Adel Khalaf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"575a96179251412dc10012af","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amed Khalil","original_name":"Amed Khalil","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"575a9627c3a3686bcf000967","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tarek Ismail","original_name":"Tarek Ismail","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"575a96359251412dc10012b8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jehad Abo al-Enein","original_name":"Jehad Abo al-Enein","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"575a96419251410aa7000531","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wael Shawky","original_name":"Wael Shawky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575a9202c3a3686bcf00086c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633300,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ahmed Zayan","original_name":"Ahmed Zayan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575a9597c3a3680ba8001445","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633301,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mahmoud Shaaban","original_name":"Mahmoud Shaaban","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575a95b5c3a368068e00058e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633302,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ibrahim Baalousha","original_name":"Ibrahim Baalousha","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575a95d0c3a3686bcf00094a","department":"Production","job":"Supervising Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2868,"name":"crusade"},{"id":11691,"name":"puppetry"},{"id":226327,"name":"arabic perspective"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"MoMa","release_date":"2015-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
