Her short film Monangambée addresses the torture by the Portuguese army of a sympathizer of the Angolan resistance. At the end of editing, Sarah Maldoror approached the members of the Art Ensemble of Chicago during a Parisian concert and offered to add sound to her film. The next day they watched the film, were convinced and recorded their first soundtrack for free as evidence of African-American solidarity. Shot in Algiers, Monangambée is a film about torture and, more broadly, about the incomprehension between the colonized and the colonizers. It is based on a novel by the Angolan writer Luandino Vieira, then imprisoned by the Portuguese colonial power.","popularity":0.3714,"poster_path":"/kRwCbAFKVyiJ24xJvWniA0hLDf6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AO","name":"Angola"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monangambeee","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed Zinet","original_name":"Mohamed Zinet","popularity":0.1767,"profile_path":"/1zbSOuOYT9lBPlN2ZNihEtgU9wV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e161bd00cb33500150347da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2504284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Pestana","original_name":"Carlos Pestana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e161bde11386c0013c7b894","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisa Andrade","original_name":"Elisa Andrade","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e161be80cd32a0014a877c1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2663786,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mário Pinto de Andrade","original_name":"Mário Pinto de Andrade","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65809d89cedac408277d6ff1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":935113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Maldoror","original_name":"Sarah Maldoror","popularity":0.1395,"profile_path":"/7w5MRfYaCoGxS1zYx0QpCd2u0Iz.jpg","credit_id":"575d39cf9251412b0c002ab5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":935113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Maldoror","original_name":"Sarah Maldoror","popularity":0.1395,"profile_path":"/7w5MRfYaCoGxS1zYx0QpCd2u0Iz.jpg","credit_id":"575d39d8925141189e000352","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568179,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luandino Vieira","original_name":"Luandino Vieira","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e161ec00cb3350017034ff3","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2663785,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Serge Michel","original_name":"Serge Michel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed6e027c4f552001fc0cc3d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2663789,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Abdelkader Adel","original_name":"Abdelkader Adel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed6e09e0398ab0021d0a5b2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0185508","wikidata_id":"Q118691154","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xJEAWqsQS08N6hYLrQxsNNDR9sN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1154,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kRwCbAFKVyiJ24xJvWniA0hLDf6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":769},{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xdbIykuT8lzmtFCbG81erxDSZ2.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":996},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":792,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dOFGG7aUK4c0JSdXBPwqYnxvGSJ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":594}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":262858,"name":"anti-colonialism"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":293298,"name":"panafricanism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: MUBI","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"1971-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival","release_date":"1971-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
