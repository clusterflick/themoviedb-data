He is the last tenant in an old house. He refuses to leave the flat in which he has passed his whole life. All appeals asking him to be 'reasonable' are of no use. And when he finally gets out his shotgun, the cops appear and use tear gas to drive him out of his flat. He is put into a straitjacket and carried out of the house as someone who's 'aggressive and always grousing'. 'The film is a bitter elegy for the unknown Vienna, seen with the eyes of an old man. A remarkable Austrian film.'","popularity":0.1154,"poster_path":"/vyTZB6We1RK3ajQiYKtwkZdg4rX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137936,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unger/Madavi Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1981-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dying Bit by Bit","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"To Die a Little","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Fernsicht","type":"working title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Mourir un peu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1708745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Solm","original_name":"Fred Solm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Walter Grünwald, the old man","credit_id":"5d80f4a4d5dbc2002ced505b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Kosutic","original_name":"Kurt Kosutic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The house manager","credit_id":"5d80f4b0cddbbc002cf66e9e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heribert Sasse","original_name":"Heribert Sasse","popularity":0.112,"profile_path":"/xodWNfnKGBcfYSYpbzGXx0Hby7k.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The attorney","credit_id":"5d80f4bd5545ca0014dd173a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1678092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inge Toifl","original_name":"Inge Toifl","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The neighbour","credit_id":"5d80f4c9cddbbc002cf66edc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Martina","original_name":"Maria Martina","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The woman physician","credit_id":"5d80f4d5cddbbc002cf66ee3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2413105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Klingenberg","original_name":"Axel Klingenberg","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"An old woman","credit_id":"5d80f4e0d5dbc20024ed50ca","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1071137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Josch","original_name":"Peter Josch","popularity":0.074,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9721126c0b3600350c10fd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2831393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günter Treptow","original_name":"Günter Treptow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"","credit_id":"5f972120a672540037104ef9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1540800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Bur","original_name":"Adolf Bur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"","credit_id":"5f97212ca1074b0037f6313b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2831395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Weizer","original_name":"Christian Weizer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9721337719d700363e2f8c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2831397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Tayab","original_name":"Martin Tayab","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":26,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9721422fe2fa0039b1ae00","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2831398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Krieghofer","original_name":"Gerald Krieghofer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":27,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9721487719d700353e25dd","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mansur Madavi","original_name":"Mansur Madavi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/9CA06IVYgkt7Z16vB8Jm9WfSXxp.jpg","credit_id":"575d3892c3a3683168003255","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mansur Madavi","original_name":"Mansur Madavi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/9CA06IVYgkt7Z16vB8Jm9WfSXxp.jpg","credit_id":"575d388ac3a3681351001993","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2413100,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dieter Schrage","original_name":"Dieter Schrage","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d80f47ccddbbc002cf66e53","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2385056,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heinz Leonhardsberger","original_name":"Heinz Leonhardsberger","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef4e927c3bffe00356c4be7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2691543,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Janda S.
