They are the British hydrographer, Bartholomew James Sulivan, and the Russian commandant, Jacov Andreyevitch Bodisco, two men who fought on opposite sides in the war. It also traces the rise and fall of the multi-cultural community of Bomarsund. The small island of Åland, located in the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Finland, played a significant role in the war that raged during 1854, originally called the Oriental War and partially fought in Northern Europe. The Baltic campaigns became the forgotten theatre of the Crimean War. The attention awarded events elsewhere has overshadowed the significance of this theatre, which lay close to the Russian capital of St Petersburg.","popularity":0.8626,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5975,"logo_path":"/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png","name":"YLE","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":77926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pelago film","origin_country":""},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bomarsund 1854 - The Baltic Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonas Tuominen","original_name":"Jonas Tuominen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575a5308c3a3680ba8000659","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonas Tuominen","original_name":"Jonas Tuominen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575a531bc3a3680ba8000660","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156140,"name":"baltic sea"},{"id":209732,"name":"Åland islands"},{"id":226322,"name":"crimean war (1853-56)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
