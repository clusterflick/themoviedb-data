But like unto the dark ages, whenever a man desired a maid he took her with or without her leave. Thus far did the chief go, but her lover decides to match his strength of arms for so fair a bride, and they fight upon the cliff's edge. But here the maid takes up the bow of fate and sends an arrow into the heart of her captor. Thus the two forest lovers are united, but a life for a life is the law of their race and the lover is brought to the council chamber and tried before his kinsmen. To shield the woman he loves he remains silent.","popularity":0.1117,"poster_path":"/x2nyvh2smBGnT7u4ggfd6NPSVsU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Romance of the Cliff Dwellers","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Sawyer","original_name":"Laura Sawyer","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/2qOX6ZsRVeCFaG3prBCvKoQTMTZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Maiden","credit_id":"575be8fa92514159d5000492","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Prior","original_name":"Herbert Prior","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/wN0WTT9TqPt6JvI5JsnGhp2yoMN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"First Romantic Rival","credit_id":"575be90a9251415a0a000471","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Gordon","original_name":"James Gordon","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":"/ngVF1uIAGqnZULYGu43OzRV6VfR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Second Romantic Rival","credit_id":"575be91bc3a368483a0017de","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.
