You know it's the future because H (played with neurotic gravity by Silicon Valley's Thomas Middleditch) is wearing a shiny gold jacket, H2 (Elisabeth Gray) is playing with computers, and C (Humphrey Ker) announces that he has to \"go to the skull\" before sticking his face into a bunch of green lights. It sounds like your typical sci-fi B-movie, complete with an incoherent plot. Except Sunspring isn't the product of Hollywood hacksâ€”it was written entirely by an AI. To be specific, it was authored by a recurrent neural network called long short-term memory, or LSTM for short. At least, that's what we'd call it. The AI named itself Benjamin.","popularity":0.5246,"poster_path":"/6nKr5Xs9xkX9ZsZi8251VZT2COy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65906,"logo_path":"/yhW51nVDvB3mafbk8ND87jYpmWW.png","name":"End
