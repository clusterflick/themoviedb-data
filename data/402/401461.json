An agent of a foreign power also wants to establish a secret airbase there, so he stirs up the natives against The Phantom, who has been able to get them to stay peaceful so far. When The Phantom is murdered, his son takes his place and sets out to restore peace to the jungle and stop the agents' and the treasure hunters' nefarious plans.","popularity":1.4381,"poster_path":"/uSZrqoprWkiK770H7XUjLXzyGzD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":299,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The most fantastic...most exciting serial ever made!","title":"The Phantom","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Tyler","original_name":"Tom Tyler","popularity":0.3825,"profile_path":"/zvp2SbUJiFfmZN95hVf0erT8cAo.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Godfrey Prescott / The Phantom","credit_id":"575a47fac3a36807540004a4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Bates","original_name":"Jeanne Bates","popularity":0.1696,"profile_path":"/d0sb01vqRKDP0jNBbWEbs8VaIUj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Diana Palmer","credit_id":"575a482692514128780004b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth MacDonald","original_name":"Kenneth MacDonald","popularity":0.147,"profile_path":"/hnCiqF8FIr8hm090HI56cwqLLcI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Bremmer","credit_id":"575a48a992514128fa00048f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Shannon","original_name":"Frank Shannon","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/aRBY351YHoCKwrTknhDwwNmpCeF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Professor Davidson","credit_id":"575a48c4c3a3686ad80007ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Adams","original_name":"Ernie Adams","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/zpKSSdsuDVofN1GAAbKnkn2GjrL.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Rusty Fenton (uncredited)","credit_id":"649c530177c01f012dc4dbb1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Caruso","original_name":"Anthony Caruso","popularity":0.7058,"profile_path":"/8eDPQrngmyQW8NrNbZ9oOfOM9ti.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Count Silento (uncredited)","credit_id":"649c5313af58cb00e2a83d93","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Chesebro","original_name":"George Chesebro","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/s8A5WerpnAjIom4ezjiTEcDEOc4.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Marsden (uncredited)","credit_id":"649c532596386400c671ba1c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Cobb","original_name":"Edmund Cobb","popularity":0.2406,"profile_path":"/icnYHc5GwjZzl9wF2nLP8rPvL8a.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Grogan (uncredited)","credit_id":"649c533577c01f012dc4dbc5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iron Eyes Cody","original_name":"Iron Eyes Cody","popularity":0.3244,"profile_path":"/23h9CuvnyzjJGYsodDTXbiaBuA.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Native (uncredited)","credit_id":"649c5344c392660125bfc067","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Curtis","original_name":"Dick Curtis","popularity":0.3143,"profile_path":"/yLb6fRcbl1T58a0H7htYBQWlJI3.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Tartar Chieftain (uncredited)","credit_id":"649c5358b1f68d00af529578","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"I.
