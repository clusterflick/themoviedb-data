He proposes a reflection on war, on vengeance and also on the mark of guilt which ends with the joie de vivre and the expansion of passions. In the intimacy of Calatrava, his is a post-Bauhaus picture of a Fascist neatness which then contrasts with the chaos of battles, the abyss of misery and the sexual stampede after triumph or failure. In this context, religion, instead of being a consolation is both an escape and the tomb of humanity; the chapel wherein Leonora hides is made out of huge crosses and in one of them, just for a moment, Don Álvaro seems crucified by his fate.","popularity":0.5126,"poster_path":"/jER7MaWzKjca8MkvWPF16ZgTkF0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34,"logo_path":"/mtp1fvZbe4H991Ka1HOORl572VH.png","name":"Sony
