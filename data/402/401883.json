On the bare space of a stage or in the crowded streets of the Old City of Jerusalem everyone fights – through physical actions, the gestures of the actors and people, through words and music – an ‘inner war that is also the war of the world’. From the travel diaries, the emotions and the glances, the film brings together stories that cross over borders, stories ‘atrocious and happy, simple and full of poetry’, underlying the importance of the theatre and art.","popularity":0.063,"poster_path":"/bxavKcYvoquW7taTeizWujIwboY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guerra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pippo Delbono","original_name":"Pippo Delbono","popularity":0.1072,"profile_path":"/7ekeaFCtLGofINTSHdOGCpStDVP.jpg","credit_id":"575dca01c3a3681c2e000378","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1510752","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qHSVhGaDHUGbFPvmdkIr0YXnGyN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":765,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/bxavKcYvoquW7taTeizWujIwboY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":510}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2003-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
