Attention is given to the American reaction to the crisis, both inside and outside of the country. The focus here is on the conduct of the hostages themselves and how they managed to survive within such a volatile situation.","popularity":0.0822,"poster_path":"/1PkE8XK3HZ2Xfum1qPkFJO7spss.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87922,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canamedia Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1986-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"444 Days to Freedom: What Really Happened in Iran","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1778557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Lopez","original_name":"James Lopez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself - Marine Sergeant","credit_id":"58cc61d4c3a3685212002417","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379635,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Les Harris","original_name":"Les Harris","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58cc61f192514174300025f8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379635,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Les Harris","original_name":"Les Harris","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58cc61e8925141741a00241d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379635,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Les Harris","original_name":"Les Harris","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58cc61e1925141742600240c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2719986","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/66kmK2a4HVN9pr3UklgaJ1XQ05S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1PkE8XK3HZ2Xfum1qPkFJO7spss.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
