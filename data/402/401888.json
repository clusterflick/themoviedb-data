And it's not just the two headliners; listen, for example, to the entrance of the stepsisters at the beginning of Act One. Nevertheless, some viewers may find the staging problematic, with singers in clown-like costumes and sets featuring human-sized rodents. Those seeking a more conventional production might want to consider the Houston Grand Opera DVD, also on Decca, with Cecilia Bartoli and Raul Jimenez. Both sets are wonderful, but, for me, Joyce Didonato and Juan Diego Florez are slightly to be preferred. Highly recommended.","popularity":0.1101,"poster_path":"/875KpzDW0yoQk89oYgEzQ6QKkV5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2008-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is an excellent version of one of the greatest of all comic","title":"Rossini La Cenerentola","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":268115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Diego Flórez","original_name":"Juan Diego Flórez","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/5C27Cvb0Pvv1Nm8bmKy4T8SWzWI.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Don Ramiro","credit_id":"575dd582c3a3680470000774","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":276525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce DiDonato","original_name":"Joyce DiDonato","popularity":0.2132,"profile_path":"/myd2U5QoH8dEx5TxTEZuA5cnMzw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Angelina","credit_id":"575dd5a8c3a368379100102d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno de Simone","original_name":"Bruno de Simone","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Don Magnifico","credit_id":"575dd5c8c3a36837310011a2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1251694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Obregón","original_name":"Cristina Obregón","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Clorinda","credit_id":"575dd5f3c3a36806ad0007a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simón Orfila","original_name":"Simón Orfila","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Alidoro","credit_id":"575dd619c3a36806ad0007ab","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Menéndez","original_name":"David Menéndez","popularity":0.1439,"profile_path":"/34DpHkDnPHgw1dLo0huQLPN85w3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dandini","credit_id":"575dd63cc3a36805be0006dd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1410691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Itxaro Mentxaka","original_name":"Itxaro Mentxaka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/zazRJk6YFjKPbHhqxDbYjpJpkVG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tisbe","credit_id":"575dd65b9251413eb20006ba","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Summers","original_name":"Patrick Summers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/tVyWX0qH6xFeXcWAARZfPHKL38i.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"575dd674c3a3680608000703","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1634745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Font","original_name":"Joan Font","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575dd914c3a36804700007f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1202996,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacopo Ferretti","original_name":"Jacopo Ferretti","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575dd9739251414a820055d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932836,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gioacchino Rossini","original_name":"Gioacchino Rossini","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":"/rEOcvlxwKQlOgFpzLPp0Qw6Ig7n.jpg","credit_id":"57dd32939251416e7f001164","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qUTmQ3dOeL87T1ehVaGWXC8fQRZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/875KpzDW0yoQk89oYgEzQ6QKkV5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
