Eager to spark interest in his boss’s newspaper, he published news of a colourful bird, more like a parrot than a chicken, less like an ostrich than a swan. No one could work out the origin of this strange bird and a web of sensational stories soon spun, but it burst the moment it came out that the witty journalist repainted an ordinary duck. From that moment on every lie journalists tell is called a ‘canard’. Our film leads directly to the nest of one such duck, in Bucharest, where the inform-propaganda spin doctor Pavel Judin, instructed by wise managerial orders and Moscow, overblows this featherless bird to the pleasure of ones and the derision of others.","popularity":0.403,"poster_path":"/k2uuxTXQgXXU3FIL98AbJS4jGcW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duga Film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Meeting","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Great Meeting","type":"translation"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2001951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dragoje Čović","original_name":"Dragoje Čović","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5aaf32eac3a36836fe01bb9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312022,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Ivan Lalić","original_name":"Ivan Lalić","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5aaf3304c3a36846b7036fcc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438492,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Josip Sudar","original_name":"Josip Sudar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5aaf330c92514116b1030596","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stevo Vujatović","original_name":"Stevo Vujatović","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5aaf3314c3a36846c9033356","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633580,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walter Neugebauer","original_name":"Walter Neugebauer","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652c2c55358da700e3be1085","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633587,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eduard Gloz","original_name":"Eduard Gloz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652c2c33ea84c700aef31c29","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538533,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Albert Pregernik","original_name":"Albert Pregernik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652c2c281f3e6000e2909c0e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norbert Neugebauer","original_name":"Norbert Neugebauer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652c2c4e358da700e3be107f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1460735,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Frano Vodopivec","original_name":"Frano Vodopivec","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652c2c3d72c13e0120cf2c81","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538533,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Albert Pregernik","original_name":"Albert Pregernik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575b2387c3a368547c000712","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633580,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walter Neugebauer","original_name":"Walter Neugebauer","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575b13569251412a01000467","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633587,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eduard Gloz","original_name":"Eduard Gloz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575b2394925141270a0006c5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2001950,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mirko Trišler","original_name":"Mirko Trišler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aaf32d492514116b103056d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0324421","wikidata_id":"Q31185275","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1059,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k2uuxTXQgXXU3FIL98AbJS4jGcW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":736,"name":"journalist"},{"id":2903,"name":"propaganda"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
