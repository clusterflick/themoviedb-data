It was the culmination of the biggest game Nell Delaney and her gang had ever undertaken. The girl, in order to land an over-cautious victim, had actually married Karl Kreidt, an unsophisticated young man, who had just come into possession of a large amount of money. He was thoroughly infatuated with the woman, could do naught but plan for her comfort, and so fell into the trap she had devised.","popularity":0.2327,"poster_path":"/534UxFZ7Axy3LkVf7NFeDg5DBIQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Night Call Came","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Oliver","original_name":"Guy Oliver","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/tLe4A808lGBfSenS42k1ZeAdZEO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Karl Kreidt","credit_id":"575c17a49251417cba0006a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugenie Besserer","original_name":"Eugenie Besserer","popularity":0.1852,"profile_path":"/fcej4GbVD6SSlwbmDotLlv68Nbt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nell Delaney","credit_id":"575c17bac3a3683dff000218","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe King","original_name":"Joe King","popularity":0.1751,"profile_path":"/wCQK5tVurkQL00FeDwW6nh3viLn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"575c17c992514120a100023c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Huntley","original_name":"Fred Huntley","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":"/hXDjCEAAoaIyYYhknrwxNMwFvnm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"575c17d4c3a36860c2000d64","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":951261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Hernandez","original_name":"George Hernandez","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":"/qDb0rmbrShNUnopaFIx18hwugFL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"575c17df92514143c4000f54","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1405087,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William E.
