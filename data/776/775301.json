It moves in a calculated, almost mathematical way. It is without any kind of special effect. With the exception of a type of rhythm that is established, its evocation is dependent upon the content of each image and how the images relate to each other relative to their position in time and space ... METONIC CYCLES raises many types of questions. They are questions which deal with philosophy and perception. While the questions are not answered, the observer, if on the proper wavelength, can develop an ambivalence, that is, a feeling that is a mixture of comprehension and lack-of-comprehension. The resulting point-of-view can be one of acceptance, e. g., that while the images have an unreal appearance, this is the way things really are.\" â€” James Cagle","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/z3v1TBenoYHwgTbbxVzym14uzcC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metonic Cycles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2886181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Cagle","original_name":"James Cagle","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nU4ARUjJN9ottncgqItbzGAMiUz.jpg","credit_id":"5fd509d928723c0043a0f187","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z3v1TBenoYHwgTbbxVzym14uzcC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
