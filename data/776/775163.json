Filmed by Herbert Brieger in 1944, it is an attempt to capture in images a mythical vision of the Basque people passed through the filter of Nazi propaganda. A tableware with Basque motifs shows the use of swastika in its decoration. The discoidal stelae of the cemeteries will also be the center of attention. It is part of the work of the filmmakers of the German regime to use peoples of Europe that served them to justify their songs of race during the years of World War II.\" Punto de Vista Film Festival","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/aQJcvr9b40WJGkDyjOJteo5hrWD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1944-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Im Lande der Basken","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1704791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Brieger","original_name":"Herbert Brieger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd4b510dd47e1003ea8fa6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aQJcvr9b40WJGkDyjOJteo5hrWD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
