The Kitchen's Jeff Mauro and Katie Lee, Chopped's Amanda Freitag, and Guy's Grocery Games' Melissa d'Arabian, along with their families and friends, set sail on The Disney Dream cruise ship for three days of sun, fun and food. Go behind the scenes as the hosts go where no cameras have gone before -- the inner workings of the ship's galleys, the kitchens, where The Dream's talented chefs prepare food for thousands every day. And no cruise would be complete without surf, sand and, of course, incredible meals.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disney Dream Cruise with the Food Network","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
