If, in addition, that priest is a defender of smuggling of which he confesses to be a faithful practitioner and unleashes, among other things, his opinions about how the Basques love, we are before a great personal and collective portrait. With great success and cinematographic sense, Hubert Knapp dedicated one of his chapters in the French Southwest entirely to an interview with Jean Elissalde \"Zerbitzari\", priest born in Ascain, screenwriter and member of Euskaltzaindia who did not drop the bible in one hand to play ball with the other. The Parisian filmmaker meets and portrays him in his beautiful Gerezieta parish, a small world that reflects his universe.\" Punto de Vista Film Festival.
