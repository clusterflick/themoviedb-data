After all, defence is the best form of attack. That is until her guardian angel 'Paul' comes into her life. Paul teaches Ariel how to 'feel alive' again. But how will their love endure the test of Society's oppressive views of what they 'are'. Will they overcome the many obstacles faced by them for being 'unsuited' in love and the fact that they are homeless? 'Ariel' explores the common occurrences faced daily on the streets by the homeless and LGBT communities worldwide. Homophobic, transphobic and racial abuse to name but a few. This time with tragic consequences.","popularity":0.1524,"poster_path":"/eRxv1GVsS0sPEnOQ6QrGepoWZdg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ariel","video":false,"vote_average":9.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Macéo Bhardwaj","original_name":"Macéo Bhardwaj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd47e5fecc7e8003fd20cbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5352136","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eRxv1GVsS0sPEnOQ6QrGepoWZdg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
