By all accounts, however, it was a soft opening, with only Spaceship Earth being dedicated on that day.  A grand opening week was held from October 15-27 for celebrates, key press, VIPs and top executives from corporate sponsors. The television special Epcot Center: The Opening Celebration aired on CBS October 23, 1982, the night before the official park dedication.  You can still find the dedication plaque from then CEO E. Cardon Walker dated October 24th, 1982 at the entrance of the park.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Epcot Opening Day","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
