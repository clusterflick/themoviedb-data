It documents the heartbreaking condition of people on the streets, and the crushing decisions Seattle entrepreneurs are forced to contemplate as their life savings and dreams are destroyed by theft, vandalism and a dwindling customer base. This documentary also explores potential bold solutions to treat those living on the streets and pair them with agencies and assistance that can provide a clear path away from the endless circle of addiction and crime.","popularity":0.5078,"poster_path":"/acIzVqUg9gtb1cF7Hr3Q3f8Gya9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167063,"logo_path":null,"name":"KOMO News","origin_country":""},{"id":167065,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sinclair Broadcast Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Program looks at effects of city's permissive posture","title":"The Fight for the Soul of Seattle","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Seattle Is Dying 2","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2306530,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Johnson","original_name":"Eric Johnson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/9PXgC09JDow86NmAoBRV4eyoXP3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fea3b47678259003c1c3d83","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2306530,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Johnson","original_name":"Eric Johnson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/9PXgC09JDow86NmAoBRV4eyoXP3.jpg","credit_id":"5fd6b7da6818880042978cb9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ss0eX3FfwBVQS03X6Ji3oUFxaqw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/acIzVqUg9gtb1cF7Hr3Q3f8Gya9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1803,"name":"drug addiction"},{"id":2350,"name":"seattle, washington"},{"id":2981,"name":"homelessness"},{"id":40921,"name":"street crime"},{"id":162502,"name":"news report"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Fight for the Soul of Seattle | A KOMO News Documentary","key":"WijoL3Hy_Bw","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-12-13T19:00:10.000Z","id":"61cda074524978001c717cd9"}]}}}
