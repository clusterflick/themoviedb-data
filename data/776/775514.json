The sudden lockdown enforced by the Government of Nepal to contain the transmission of coronavirus in the Kathmandu Valley and other parts of the country severely affected the lives of the Nepali public. Manoj Shrestha hails from Kathmandu. A true Samaritan, he converted his car into an ambulance during the lockdown and ferried people to and from hospital despite having a pregnant wife at home. Arun Sainju and Rajesh Sainju faced discrimination from their neighbours for their selfless volunteerism. On the governmentâ€™s request, they cremated the body of the first officially recorded case to die of Covid-19, a young woman who died after childbirth. The film highlights their inspirational stories, the anxiety-filled stay in isolation centers after testing Positive, and, the social discrimination frontline volunteers often face.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Civil Soldiers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2891582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ganesh Panday","original_name":"Ganesh Panday","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd5989e414291003d45c1cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
