Harassment, mental violence, manipulation, cornering – these topics are current in both politics as well as private sphere. In these nightmarish confrontations, dramatics, mysticism as well as twisted comedy can be found.  The main character of the first short film “Nissan Patrol” by Katrin Maimik and Andres Maimik is art student Jane, who hitchhikes on a secluded road and is picked up by a manly SUV. The youngster behind the wheel misunderstands the girl’s carefree behaviour and suddenly turns into a narrow side road.","popularity":0.1655,"poster_path":"/ycJtSq85WTh7RXBrXmV8T1VIRWh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6145,"logo_path":"/ZTOGLby368NkNZCuDNBdhzNnlp.png","name":"Moonwalker
