Backstage at the program , it is chaos--the children are out of control, and the director is out of patience. To make matters worse, Grandpa Jim's truck breaks down on the way to the performance.  Fortunately he is able to convince a reluctant police officer to give him a lift to the program, or we all would have missed out on a wonderful presentation filled with original music, new talent, and a lot of fun.  The entire family will enjoy this special treat as they consider in a more meaningful way the great gift God gave us--His only Son.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":"/b3aMd1876IkOEf141F6OaewafNH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just in Time for Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b3aMd1876IkOEf141F6OaewafNH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
