An old hippie named Obie Franco Canobie misinforms Splash to travel to Provincetown, Massachusetts, because it was a Mecca for heterosexuals back in the 1960's. Upon his arrival, Splash is constantly hit upon by gay men, and his advances are rejected by many local lesbians. Just about to return back to California, Splash runs into Axel, the self-proclaimed \"King of the Straight Scene\". Soon, Splash is introduced to the vivacious Jennifer, and the two fall for each other.","popularity":0.3487,"poster_path":"/eFaFMIeshrsNl9j5nc6wVWzsGBh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jailbait Summer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":193933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiny Tim","original_name":"Tiny Tim","popularity":0.2036,"profile_path":"/zUVnXDGxtoScoVaMvazRpL7AIjZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4621bec4ebd28a253cbfc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5304389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheila Armstrong","original_name":"Sheila Armstrong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4625cfac1630c2602a1d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5304391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake azer","original_name":"Jake azer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4626b00bbfe6a7553cfe8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5304393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mielle conklin","original_name":"Mielle conklin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67d46289e9e5846a3f028c77","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2608307,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Frank Crivelli","original_name":"Frank Crivelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4629abf4818854c6516aa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5304395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eilish cruise","original_name":"Eilish cruise","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67d462b0e9e5846a3f028c9c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3292483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"liz dennis","original_name":"liz dennis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67d462cae9e5846a3f028cba","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2608304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Morrill","original_name":"Jonathan Morrill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd4f84560b58d00448385e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7112118","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eFaFMIeshrsNl9j5nc6wVWzsGBh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
