The controversial bill sparked immediate outrage over widespread fear of arbitrary detention and politically motivated trials that would decimate Hong Kong’s autonomy under ‘one country, two systems.’ Protests escalated into epic pro-democracy demonstrations, in part led by young people connected via social media. COCKROACH, filmed during the height of the protests, captures the extraordinary intensity of an unprecedented era in Hong Kong’s history.","popularity":0.3707,"poster_path":"/eQzXPuuGBITNJKmFfGMkX5PO1qH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cockroach","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"蟑螂","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":126849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Ho Wan-Si","original_name":"何韻詩","popularity":0.1714,"profile_path":"/5RIM6xAHErSeSyZX0HK7tPthgpX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"604c83b022e4800028ac4058","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ai Weiwei","original_name":"Ai Weiwei","popularity":0.3279,"profile_path":"/hD3ot74TFao8xDaeUaxuRK0RKsS.jpg","credit_id":"5fd6211e006b010040df70c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13696108","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eQzXPuuGBITNJKmFfGMkX5PO1qH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4UyaUNex4wfLAV73idJ3fL2LRum.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cockroach (2020) – A Film by Ai Weiwei | Trailer | Alamo On Demand Exclusive","key":"dJuYB6HIfrk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-12-11T19:30:38.000Z","id":"5fd82f13db952d003f7ebaad"}]}}}
