It focuses on the 21 years that İlhan spent in prison and his family’s experience of those years without him. The narrative is constructed through the letters İlhan wrote and aims to describe his life, his emotions and longings. The film constructs İlhan’s history through a chronology in the prison but refrains from restricting it only to a “prisoner’s quest for justice”, and rather tells a story of the situations he finds himself in over the years and his emotions and their equivalents in life.","popularity":0.3531,"poster_path":"/pV4LfRA4k6aymGGlci1IjkdVqlp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary on the life of the poet İlhan Sami Çomak.","title":"Posted by: İlhan Sami Çomak","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Mittente: İlhan Sami Çomak","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sender: İlhan Sami Çomak","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Posted by: İlhan Sami Çomak","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2959333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"İlhan Sami Çomak","original_name":"İlhan Sami Çomak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9nfDNixo5oQDKllFgLPkJI4xZQ0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6016ba50cb802800411110b6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333340,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sertaç Yıldız","original_name":"Sertaç Yıldız","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd5e60507291c004273ddbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333338,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Çiğdem Mazlum","original_name":"Çiğdem Mazlum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd5e5e9006b010041de3458","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"G%C3%B6nderen-%C4%B0lhan-Sami-%C3%87omak-1577945002480843","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/pV4LfRA4k6aymGGlci1IjkdVqlp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":848},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/4JAsyRG2ugSPg4BduZp8mjVErY4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":771},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8F3Vyv7DPvrAmpRlelsNathiNJl.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":679}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2883,"name":"imprisonment"},{"id":5933,"name":"poet"},{"id":9672,"name":"based on true story"},{"id":14783,"name":"false accusations"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":180220,"name":"kurdistan"},{"id":264391,"name":"political persecution"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
