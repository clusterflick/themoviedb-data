The one where his dad was Father Christmas for the school fete, the time his mum found his dad's secret stash of presents that were not for her, the Christmas spent alone, the one where they found dead neighbours and why celebrating in the darkest time of year is a rebellious act. With music, comedy, pathos and more Christmas cheer than a Laplander's eggnog party!","popularity":0.0931,"poster_path":"/ssjagm2MmonXaQ1aR9U54MTdZIa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mark Thomas: Ouch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":194561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Thomas","original_name":"Mark Thomas","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":"/Z627xCmMvrSkDvVvbtiI55ash2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fd4fb8160b58d003f837eaa","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ssjagm2MmonXaQ1aR9U54MTdZIa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
