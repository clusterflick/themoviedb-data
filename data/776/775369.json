But who are these ancient Greeks we no longer remember?  They are much closer to us than it seems. Because the desires, the anxieties, the fears have remained the same. Hercules in Polesine is a journey through time and into the sea.  The entertaining journey through 5,000 years of stories, myths, legends that tell us about horned and cheating gods, listless heroes and  mythomaniacs, of desperate and blustering men.  And all these stories make us think about how we are now, all that way we have (not) done from the beginnings of civilization to the aftermath of the ATM queue.","popularity":0.3694,"poster_path":"/gVmbl4iYT8WoFoqFnl5KaRgOlcY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2007-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ercole in Polesine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hercules into Polesine","type":"literal translation"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalino Balasso","original_name":"Natalino Balasso","popularity":0.1093,"profile_path":"/fbPLujBl9KrUt7cBj3bOokP1gYA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62411d2c99c964005d383cd6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalino Balasso","original_name":"Natalino Balasso","popularity":0.1093,"profile_path":"/fbPLujBl9KrUt7cBj3bOokP1gYA.jpg","credit_id":"62411d467caa470047609faf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalino Balasso","original_name":"Natalino Balasso","popularity":0.1093,"profile_path":"/fbPLujBl9KrUt7cBj3bOokP1gYA.jpg","credit_id":"62411d583e09f3005b3adfce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3800050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Picchioni","original_name":"Andrea Picchioni","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a8e8072c6b7b0131a1e7fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/kYsvtRjjySsWRN6MIrXYokExQKQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/gVmbl4iYT8WoFoqFnl5KaRgOlcY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2036,"name":"greek mythology"},{"id":168551,"name":"italian stereotype"},{"id":220793,"name":"venetian"},{"id":276162,"name":"stand-up comedian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
