We looked at the program and the 1991 update in our last look at the MKC Gold Card Update.  For 1992 we travel back to 1492 and Christopher Columbus with “Update 1992, Discover A New World”.  Ok, it’s not 1492, it’s 1992 and the New World that Christopher is discovering is, of course, Walt Disney World and he is just in time for the 20th-anniversary celebration complete with 20 new thinks to discover at WDW, with all new parades, shows, and entertainment.  How is all of this possible?  With the MKC Gold Card of course and the 1992 Magic Kingdom Club Membership.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magic Kingdom Club Gold Card 1992 Update \"Discover A New World\"","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
