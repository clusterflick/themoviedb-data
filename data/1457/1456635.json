Guided by ancestors of the Beat generation and poetic kinships with radical female musicians—Patti Smith, Laurie Anderson, Cecilia Vicuña, Meredith Monk—Outrider celebrates Waldman's role as a visionary word-worker and a transcendent presence, singing out in the ancient, bardic tradition the thunderous power of poetry.","popularity":0.2502,"poster_path":"/x7BVOB6Hg9lrOY8iD2w1ObHTUNz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outrider","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1474889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Waldman","original_name":"Anne Waldman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tlhbVLk7S7rbP9YzCM4qHXUmErj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67e96c0b4f741c75bbc6af26","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233131,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alystyre Julian","original_name":"Alystyre Julian","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e98e2361cac2b3a3f6d60e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Scorsese","original_name":"Martin Scorsese","popularity":2.5528,"profile_path":"/9U9Y5GQuWX3EZy39B8nkk4NY01S.jpg","credit_id":"67e98e767a75294b76c6b00a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3921180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Riggs","original_name":"Sarah Riggs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e98e9e7a75294b76c6b017","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2064,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x7BVOB6Hg9lrOY8iD2w1ObHTUNz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1374}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"World Premiere.
