The plot derives from Lermontov's Demon, a poem which was banned for decades due to its sacrilegious content. The titular demon is a fallen angel, a figure of negation and a brooding anti-hero. He falls in love with Tamara but his love destroys her. The Demon is played by the brilliant Estonian singer Georg Ots.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/lHwn3BqFl5T6vBRc0VcTfinrun.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14620,"logo_path":"/zbQk1aw57z6LUOSQzb0MoZDLiUz.png","name":"Gosteleradio USSR","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Demon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1522230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Ots","original_name":"Georg Ots","popularity":0.1739,"profile_path":"/1eya6b6Mu4rzXXAPYWdm6ru2Ly2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Demon","credit_id":"67e8932d5787fa18654179ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Lemeshev","original_name":"Sergey Lemeshev","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/3H4YKrEbt2OZVFmZHtsyV43DfGZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Prince Sinodal","credit_id":"67e893416fe374c11641799d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4504632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Golovin","original_name":"Vitaly Golovin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e89397d3f46ea2f4cb28a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1580670,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mikhail Lermontov","original_name":"Михаил Юрьевич Лермонтов","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":"/ejqRupGWdmHwBOcs0fBeOlopwOd.jpg","credit_id":"67e893a9a7145a40a9417917","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1679551","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1331,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/lHwn3BqFl5T6vBRc0VcTfinrun.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":888}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1960-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
