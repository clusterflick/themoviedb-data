Through abstract visuals and rhythmic breathing sounds, the film evokes the transformative power of Tummo—a technique that harnesses breath and mental focus to generate profound internal heat and heightened awareness.  Stripped of narrative, the film unfolds as a sensory journey, with undulating shapes and vibrant colors acting as metaphors for the rising \"inner flame.\" The hypnotic interplay of light, sound, and movement invites the audience into a trance-like state, mirroring the meditative experience itself.  Tummo is not just a film to watch but an experience to surrender to—a momentary escape from distraction into the depths of stillness and inner energy. It is an artistic exploration of the unseen fire within, offering a space for reflection, presence, and transcendence.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/fAvxXSNlzsuIKikfUlNpcmNv1s7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ignite the fire within.","title":"Tummo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5337626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chico Peres Smith","original_name":"Chico Peres Smith","popularity":0.1126,"profile_path":"/j4sbCioNgARsxt5LNWDnLhkkncw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67e95203b5997a0261e530e6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5337626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chico Peres Smith","original_name":"Chico Peres Smith","popularity":0.1126,"profile_path":"/j4sbCioNgARsxt5LNWDnLhkkncw.jpg","credit_id":"67e9522d4f741c75bbc6a8bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5337626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chico Peres Smith","original_name":"Chico Peres Smith","popularity":0.1126,"profile_path":"/j4sbCioNgARsxt5LNWDnLhkkncw.jpg","credit_id":"67e9524061cac2b3a3f6cef7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5337626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chico Peres Smith","original_name":"Chico Peres Smith","popularity":0.1126,"profile_path":"/j4sbCioNgARsxt5LNWDnLhkkncw.jpg","credit_id":"67e952d1b5997a0261e5314e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5337626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chico Peres Smith","original_name":"Chico Peres Smith","popularity":0.1126,"profile_path":"/j4sbCioNgARsxt5LNWDnLhkkncw.jpg","credit_id":"67e952df983f1aefc7e53fd1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gLBro6JKPeWzshrOgFJ6AvlGuFZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fAvxXSNlzsuIKikfUlNpcmNv1s7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
