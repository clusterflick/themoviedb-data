Her sophomore album, Bewitched, broke Spotify's all-time streaming record for a jazz debut ever in the platform's history and resulted in her first Grammy nomination. She opens the set with \"From The Start,\" a bouncy, whimsical tune about unrequited love with a friend, connecting Chet Baker-like scats with charming and playful lyrics. Taking a more melancholic turn into 2021's \"Let You Break My Heart Again\" and \"Promise,\" her velvety vocals rich with vulnerability dance elegantly with the strings, creating a symphony of emotions. Laufey concludes the set with \"California and Me,\" which she explains was heavily influenced by her receiving her first baby grand and compositions by Liszt and Chopin. This mesmerizing performance is a captivating testament to the power of collaboration and music's ability to evoke raw, unfiltered emotion.","popularity":0.1333,"poster_path":"/ydVPZxM5Wa540xf9jN83oRhU42V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laufey: The Tiny Desk Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4375664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laufey","original_name":"Laufey","popularity":0.1992,"profile_path":"/6Dxsk7R9XXzB41kYKksQm8zxx3b.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67e83938b5655aac42639731","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4628796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sherri Zhang","original_name":"Sherri Zhang","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self (violin)","credit_id":"67e8394af1f5376875ddcacc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5335871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Henderson","original_name":"Josh Henderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self (violin)","credit_id":"67e83962e243912e3567bfaf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4628797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aria Cheregosha","original_name":"Aria Cheregosha","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self (viola)","credit_id":"67e83973a3d8cc928e67da41","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4628798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Kubota","original_name":"Ken Kubota","popularity":0.0622,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self (cello)","credit_id":"67e83983b5655aac4263974c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4628573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Pointer","original_name":"Ashley Pointer","popularity":0.114,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e8399aa3d8cc928e67da64","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4480033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Bryant","original_name":"Joshua Bryant","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e839c1f1f5376875ddcaf3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4480033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Bryant","original_name":"Joshua Bryant","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e839dbb5655aac42639775","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3166781,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Josh Rogosin","original_name":"Josh Rogosin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e839f4a3d8cc928e67da95","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1063,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i8tyNxIbZz7Luj6ZSDP9VL3bRn2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1890}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ydVPZxM5Wa540xf9jN83oRhU42V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Laufey: Tiny Desk Concert","key":"avjI3_GIZBw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-12-13T10:00:04.000Z","id":"67e9b286af752a3b24f6fd31"}]}}}
