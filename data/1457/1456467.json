Recently, one of these lost worlds was discovered in Cameroon, by a British researcher from the Kew Royal Botanical Gardens. At the foot of a volcano, Martin Cheek discovered a dense tropical forest, miraculously preserved and full of endemic plant species. In only a few expeditions, his team managed to inventory over two hundred previously unknown plant species, including orchids, types of coffee plants, and fig-trees.  Their discoveries attracted the attention of other NGOâ€™s, including CRES, an organization dedicated to the preservation of endangered animal species. Upon exploring this region, CRES members discovered that it constituted one of the rare sanctuaries where large, silver-faced monkeys called Drills, the cousins of the Mandrill, still live. In 1996, the Drill was designated by the IUCN as the African species most in need of protection.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mists of Mwanenguba","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675558,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guillaume De Ginestel","original_name":"Guillaume De Ginestel","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e8eaa1700a6a94c6e5421c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1789949","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
