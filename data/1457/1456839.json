Global warming, climate change, and over industrialization continue to threaten our planet's integrity. Come with Terry and Juniper on a nostalgia filled journey to their old treehouse, where loyalty, morals, and relationships are tested. Following Terry and his daughter Juniper on a spur-of-the-moment camping trip, we discover the true motives of the trip and see Juniper faced with a test of her morals and loyalty. Faced with a buyout from a large corporation to purchase a plot of Terry's land, Terry must confront his feelings of defeat, and Juniper must rise to the occasion to back up her dad. The relationship of a father and daughter as well as the relationship of our characters to the world around them will both be explored in this film. This film hopes to handle much broader themes such as environmentalism and a response to over industrialization in the modern age through the lens of two characters and their journey.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Old Oak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5338548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jazmin Gonzalez","original_name":"Jazmin Gonzalez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Juniper","credit_id":"67e9df245040a75b4ae5478b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5338549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Yaw","original_name":"James Yaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Terry","credit_id":"67e9df3d62235c6581c6a906","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4684098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Armstrong","original_name":"Ben Armstrong","popularity":0.3597,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Chris","credit_id":"67e9df5962235c6581c6a90f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5338550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taylor Buckallew","original_name":"Taylor Buckallew","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e9df7c62235c6581c6a921","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5338550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taylor Buckallew","original_name":"Taylor Buckallew","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e9df98a98dc813b0f6e91a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5338551,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandre Michaud","original_name":"Alexandre Michaud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e9dfc2a98dc813b0f6e940","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361954,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryan \"Rane\" Kraska","original_name":"Ryan \"Rane\" Kraska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e9dfd9b5997a0261e55968","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4502494,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kalini Jade","original_name":"Kalini Jade","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e9dfe65040a75b4ae547b5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5338553,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Callie Guyer","original_name":"Callie Guyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e9dff03fca90d2dff6f45d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36380387","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
