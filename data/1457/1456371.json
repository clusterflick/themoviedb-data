Since the first safety video was released in the late 1980s, the number of rowing clubs in the U.S. has more than doubled and pleasure boat traffic has increased dramatically. The need for safety awareness has never been greater. Major and minor accidents have a direct impact on the lives of those involved and some incidents can have repercussions for the entire rowing community. The safety video has two main sections, one for everyone who is involved with the rowing program and the other for just coaches and administrators. USRowing stresses that everyone review the safety video once a year and all rowing programs have an active safety committee to make sure that club policies and procedures are up to date.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"US Rowing Safety","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
