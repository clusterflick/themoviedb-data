His time in Asturias and the melancholy of a forced migration inspired him to compose several of his best known songs, connecting through song the two Europes: the one he left and the one that welcomed him.  Upon his return, with the violence still latent, Andrés delves into the deepest landscapes of his territory and the most painful memories that the war left behind, composing in memory of those who no longer walk with him; music saved him and that is why he decided that 'it is better to sing than to point out'.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/pxCKt70n1FtUug8GW9h01eYz8l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2025-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Europe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2661376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge David Pérez","original_name":"Jorge David Pérez","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gk18E3mpajXlhEzvxGoIlDmbWd4.jpg","credit_id":"67e85ce0b5655aac4263a3b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2883947,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Álvaro J.
