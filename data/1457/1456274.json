The waters flow very slowly, with a barely noticeable  current towards the sea at low tide and upstream at high tide. This  complex ecosystem is home to a great diversity of animal and plant  species. Shot in the border region between the states of Texas and  Louisiana, the film follows the course of the approximately 900-kilometre-long  Sabine River. It documents the sometimes surprising  behavior of numerous animals that live there, such as ants,  raccoons, crayfish, water turtles, egrets, pelicans,  fish and jellyfish. The Mississippi alligator also lives here, growing up to  two and a half meters long and weighing in at 90 kilograms. It  is at the top of the food chain - and when it shows its 90 razor-sharp teeth with a  beaming “smile”, you understand  why.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/vPWLf02F0HdW2G9xFJqYd7A9tBd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gatorlands‎","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Wilde Wasserwelten im tiefen Süden der USA","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751501,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian Armstrong","original_name":"Brian Armstrong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e860836b367d469567dbcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/kG1wGjJWf6xPLPs5YyLyKbbBu1d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wOfTjKpjhFP2a9NXl8SczuGBZQ6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":794,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/vPWLf02F0HdW2G9xFJqYd7A9tBd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2022-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
