On the monitors, random fragments of natural phenomena, such as fire and pounding surf, were set in opposition to more domestic scenes of deterioration, centering on a farmhouse in ruins. A further exploration of the space revealed these elements, as subtly engaged in a systemic and coherent exchange between order and disorder, harmony and imbalance.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"d/stabilize/d","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Sykes","original_name":"Barbara Sykes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Director","credit_id":"67e977d1a98dc813b0f6e478","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
