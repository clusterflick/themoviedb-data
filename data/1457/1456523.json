Geometric shapes travel across a ‘matrix’ (grid) of cathode ray tube (CRT) screens. CRT televisions, which use manipulated electron beams to display images on a fluorescent screen, remained in widespread use until the early 2000s. The Vasulkas sought to test the limits of each monitor, creating a fluid motion resembling the behaviour of electronic signals. Matrix II is an early example of video art, which first developed in the late 1960s and 1970s as artists came into contact with new consumer technologies for capturing moving images.","popularity":0.1213,"poster_path":"/8KCbKg3de6GmdN8osCDuDc6yH0m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matrix II","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1462455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Woody Vasulka","original_name":"Woody Vasulka","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e91a67983f1aefc7e53847","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steina Vasulka","original_name":"Steina Vasulka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e91a77a98dc813b0f6cf5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":865,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2nOjWSRPBqAhZZnRmNHUzqT7XX7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1538}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":770,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8KCbKg3de6GmdN8osCDuDc6yH0m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
