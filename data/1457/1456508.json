They were born in France, after the second world war. Their families came from Central and Eastern Europe in the 20s and 30s, fleeing antisemitism and poverty. After the Holocaust, they grew up among ghosts, between anger, a desire for vengeance and a will to change the world. In the 60s and 70s, they became activists.  Through their personal stories and the tale of their internationalist and antifascist struggle, the movie shows the audacity of those years of dissent.","popularity":0.1359,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nous vengerons nos pères","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5337354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florence Johsua","original_name":"Florence Johsua","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e913f9700a6a94c6e549e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5337355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Boespflug","original_name":"Bernard Boespflug","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e9140a983f1aefc7e536aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":231020,"name":"anti-fascism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
