They are not. These bees have just landed (forming a ball around the queen?) on the limb of a bush. A sprinkler near the bush caused the departure of this group of bee's just after the filming. What we are seeing in these episodes is bee activity during the early stages of building a new hive. Each bee is intent on performing its task. Obviously, there are varying jobs here. Some are going in. Some are coming out. There are moments when some of the bees seem to be experiencing moments of extreme agitation. Are they agitated or are they involved in some sort of air conditioning? (Do you hear any whining? I don’t)…Stay tuned for future episodes which will feature \"the big bee\" and \"the white bee.\"  Originally uploaded to davidlynch.com on 2002.","popularity":0.1431,"poster_path":"/yN1XWMOvxzXMNeqzaheHQ8XVGBq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94704,"logo_path":null,"name":"davidlynch.com","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bees #3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lynch","original_name":"David Lynch","popularity":1.7106,"profile_path":"/b6TnSpuqeOlbq7aHH9G4inmQ1v9.jpg","credit_id":"67e83f70bd1f96f9ef6375d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yN1XWMOvxzXMNeqzaheHQ8XVGBq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2002-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
