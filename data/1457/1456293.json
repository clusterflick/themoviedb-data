Standing on a table and with their faces and hands covered in metallic paint, Gilbert and George sing along to a recording of Flanagan and Allen’s old-time music-hall hit ‘Underneath the Arches’, all the while moving mechanically.  An anthem to down-and-outs, the song became a mantra for the artists. Always happy to elaborate, they have said, ‘We think of ourselves as two funny tramps, rather than artists according to the popular idea.’","popularity":0.1688,"poster_path":"/dbh0pwid1a6isJ1Jky2X2Vr0olp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":257913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sonnabend Gallery","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gilbert and George The Singing Sculpture","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2320177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert Prousch","original_name":"Gilbert Prousch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"A Singing Sculpture","credit_id":"67e86a41b5655aac4263a7cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1651315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Passmore","original_name":"George Passmore","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"A Singing Sculpture","credit_id":"67e86a590e8ee6781567cc82","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Haas","original_name":"Philip Haas","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/ejZkqudQcMsNTY126047kQ76xiJ.jpg","credit_id":"67e86a94bd1f96f9ef637d49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4764346,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mark Trottenberg","original_name":"Mark Trottenberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e86c8ab5655aac4263a8f2","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2811299,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joe Arcidiacono","original_name":"Joe Arcidiacono","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e86caef1f5376875ddd3fc","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5336317,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Liz Dory","original_name":"Liz Dory","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e86cc66deb8da720ddae0f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2670723,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Fred Cohen","original_name":"Fred Cohen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e86ce1b5655aac4263a930","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5336321,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Goroff","original_name":"John Goroff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e86cf25f93a9fd25ddd456","department":"Camera","job":"Grip"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5336323,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Langer","original_name":"Michael Langer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e86d12e243912e3567ccdd","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1405206,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lionel Strutt","original_name":"Lionel Strutt","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e86d2cf1f5376875ddd401","department":"Sound","job":"ADR Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337464,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dominick Tavella","original_name":"Dominick Tavella","popularity":0.0591,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e86d536214525cd563937a","department":"Sound","job":"ADR Recording Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Haas","original_name":"Philip Haas","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/ejZkqudQcMsNTY126047kQ76xiJ.jpg","credit_id":"67e86d6eb5655aac4263a970","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fkya6Wqy1tZnqp3DzbP9nrcVM45.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":857,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dbh0pwid1a6isJ1Jky2X2Vr0olp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":603}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
