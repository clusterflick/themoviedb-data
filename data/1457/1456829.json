He's a hard worker and dedicated, but he just can't seem to catch a break. To pay the bills, he works at Luna, Dublin's most exclusive restaurant. When world-famous director Brendan Bloom arrives at Luna for dinner, Finn sees an opportunity to further his career. Flouting accepted etiquette, he boldly takes his chance to talk to the auteur. This decision is the catalyst for a twisted sequence of events that will change both men's lives forever, culminating in the performance of a lifetime from our young waiter.","popularity":0.1919,"poster_path":"/mPLR43YdMz5YxuzQbr24jB19rac.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Final Curtain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paudge Behan","original_name":"Paudge Behan","popularity":0.1677,"profile_path":"/x2pba4olZDm3YBroGLvHWat1aM5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Brendan Bloom","credit_id":"67e9da054f741c75bbc6b73c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4921578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Cullen","original_name":"Stuart Cullen","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Finn O'Connor","credit_id":"67e9da26a98dc813b0f6e7e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1989244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eve Connolly","original_name":"Eve Connolly","popularity":0.2811,"profile_path":"/qzNUbOgKQl22GNF3UG6THMEeIrj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Polly","credit_id":"67e9da373fca90d2dff6f31a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosalind Lipsett","original_name":"Rosalind Lipsett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Claudia","credit_id":"67e9da5fb5997a0261e557ea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2656395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Delaney Tynan","original_name":"Jonathan Delaney Tynan","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":"/nIk04wzz9jHu2tjJdrUirc0Oelq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Shirley Temple","credit_id":"67e9da7861cac2b3a3f6e9b5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1866488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irma Mali","original_name":"Irma Mali","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":"/3yyyNbP9wugh7vRi9FNZBAGJ0m5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Paloma","credit_id":"67e9da8b983f1aefc7e54a98","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5338501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Gifford","original_name":"Dan Gifford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e9d9ea700a6a94c6e56dde","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13315266","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mPLR43YdMz5YxuzQbr24jB19rac.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
