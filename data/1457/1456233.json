My parents were among the generation that survived occupation and lived through the 'Hunger Winter', often eating tulip bulbs to survive. Now, 80 years since the war ended, the stories of those who survived are here to remind us of the perils of war. As the world faces new totalitarian threats, these stories are more relevant than they ever have been in my lifetime. Inspired by a photo of my Aunt Femie, wearing her only dress, standing on the street waving at Allied tanks on Liberation Day May 1945, I have been seeking out and interviewing the remaining survivors of that period. Over the last 2 years, I have met with 80 people, the length and breadth of the Netherlands, one for each year of freedom. These are their stories.","popularity":0.3244,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":117901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot Dot Dash","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2025-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"wwII","title":"80 FACES OF FREEDOM","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303128,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Van Bruggen","original_name":"Jason Van Bruggen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e8504c6b367d469567d70e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303128,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Van Bruggen","original_name":"Jason Van Bruggen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e85064e243912e3567c2fc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303128,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Van Bruggen","original_name":"Jason Van Bruggen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e85074e243912e3567c2ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5336038,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"LIam Crawford","original_name":"LIam Crawford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e85085e243912e3567c30b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2048606,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harry Knazan","original_name":"Harry Knazan","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e850986b367d469567d71e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":2434,"name":"liberation"},{"id":1199,"name":"netherlands"},{"id":193534,"name":"canadian army"},{"id":200400,"name":"occupation"},{"id":221689,"name":"military history"},{"id":279911,"name":"nazi germany"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":["Mature Theme"],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
