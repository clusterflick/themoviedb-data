Despite the natural beauty and small-town charm, the couple struggles to adjust. Sam wrestles with her stagnant career and is forced to confront the traumatic events of her past. Their uneasy transition becomes even more unsettling when Henry, a peculiar lifelong local and neighbor, raises suspicion. When Sam discovers a necklace she believes belonged to her late mother and an antique diary, she begins to suspect that the spirit of an ancestor is trying to reach her. As the seasons pass, tension escalates. Sam starts sleepwalking, inexplicably drawn to the icy lake at night, and becomes consumed by the past. Her growing obsession drives Jack away, leaving her to face the bitter cold and isolation of winter entirely alone.","popularity":0.6894,"poster_path":"/dFtA2M7WbqsQN95HqU7hMMOP1XF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voices Carry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1440709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gia Crovatin","original_name":"Gia Crovatin","popularity":0.198,"profile_path":"/cKhxNgdlZvUuiEj6LyUFz0To4Kt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"67e9a045acb344d686cb150c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2057023,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeff Ayars","original_name":"Jeff Ayars","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/xdtgt59mnNhZ2UsNmDvAadaFjlY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jack","credit_id":"67e9a0d861cac2b3a3f6d8c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1595506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Holm","original_name":"Jeremy Holm","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/cOOu1DOY6s59oAMMjtXJ70RicNU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Henry","credit_id":"67e9a07e3bcaffe93e5be32e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1027298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geraldine Singer","original_name":"Geraldine Singer","popularity":0.3752,"profile_path":"/qqm2mlRUx7tHdc6DumugSscDALN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"April","credit_id":"67e9a0616b7b761e8dccb10c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2375334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dana Berger","original_name":"Dana Berger","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/tklTnzRppIv6G26U5YNa5EsL03v.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"67e9a08c6b7b761e8dccb113","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5338095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dwayne Hill","original_name":"Dwayne Hill","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Kevin","credit_id":"67e9a0b27a75294b76c6b2c3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Aberdeen","original_name":"Robert Aberdeen","popularity":0.2345,"profile_path":"/6yr4Xy4iYRynHK2qHccNwPfYAIu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Matt","credit_id":"67e9a0c87a75294b76c6b2ca","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3047795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Fragala","original_name":"Nicole Fragala","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/vYZKePyw0g2hUQyxjpVoiYyZ88V.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Lady","credit_id":"67e9a0712cdd7cc608ccb133","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3261458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Rey","original_name":"Alexandra Rey","popularity":0.1629,"profile_path":"/AfNW6659gOCeFwL2QASziDAr5j9.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Therapist","credit_id":"67e9a0fc7a75294b76c6b2dc","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4477321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abby Brenker","original_name":"Abby Brenker","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e9a13a7a75294b76c6b321","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4477321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abby Brenker","original_name":"Abby Brenker","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e9a149700a6a94c6e565b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1555113,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ellyn Vander Wyden","original_name":"Ellyn Vander Wyden","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e9a15f7a75294b76c6b345","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1555113,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ellyn Vander Wyden","original_name":"Ellyn Vander Wyden","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e9a16c61cac2b3a3f6d914","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22171820","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1185,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dFtA2M7WbqsQN95HqU7hMMOP1XF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":795}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6152,"name":"supernatural"},{"id":339552,"name":"indie"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Cinequest","release_date":"2025-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
