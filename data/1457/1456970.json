Under the same premise of the first film of the project, five people gather in a park, this time around a plastic chair, and exchange their favorite pocketable books. Summer activities such as throwing a plane make their way into the film. Moving images are brought to a stop in their final form as slides and, as is the case for an image in a book, the viewer is forced to imagine their movement. This is the result of a collaboration between PocketBookFilms and milano based artist collective, Hercole.  Participants: Davide Ausenda, Laura Salomoni, Martina Caruso, Margherita Piazza, Alexander Gabriel and Lucas Variz.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pcKRwthtdR8TtiIVEnVJay5GgQl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PBF #02, Milano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4918456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Borja Rodríguez Gimeno","original_name":"Borja Rodríguez Gimeno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ea409a2cca6fc8fbc6e6c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2122,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pcKRwthtdR8TtiIVEnVJay5GgQl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1415}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
