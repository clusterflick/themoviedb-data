Each is carefully building their own sand city. As their cities grow, the boundaries between their territories become unclear, leading to playful but growing tensions. When a prized toy goes missing, suspicion and distrust arise, and the children arm their cities with toy soldiers and begin fighting for control. The sandbox turns into a miniature war zone, with shifting alliances and ever changing borders in a cycle of conflict. Meanwhile, a lone plastic figure called Plastic Man who lives in the city, watches the chaos with concern for his familyâ€™s safety.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sandbox Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andriy Chekalskyy","original_name":"Andriy Chekalskyy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c643000696ae66bd21fe67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4876729,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Oros","original_name":"Adam Oros","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/gT1n9auTh4prb7gDZrRaBfHmkbR.jpg","credit_id":"68c64310e5f9eb9fccf21a7a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5328628,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ianna Seemungal","original_name":"Ianna Seemungal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c643b857048b71c3c8fd1e","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andriy Chekalskyy","original_name":"Andriy Chekalskyy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c643c928e73c081f70d117","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687857,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Francis Kong","original_name":"Francis Kong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c6443daf5f3484a8c8fce3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
