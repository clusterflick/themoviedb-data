A Language Only I Can Hear is a meditation on silence, on the limits of expression, and on the ache of wanting to be understood. It follows a character trapped within constraints—of the frame, of society, of gaze.  To be watched is not the same as to be seen. To be silenced is not the same as to be without words. The film explores this fragile territory: how meaning trembles at the edge of articulation, how communication can become both prison and release.  “Silence remains, inescapably, a form of speech.” The film lives in this paradox, where silence is not emptiness but a saturated presence, where the smallest gesture becomes a declaration, where the failure of language opens into another, secret form of listening.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9cDirU2d6OpXC6XXjbccGIRQwgc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Language Only I Can Hear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5690336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliz Erdal","original_name":"Eliz Erdal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68c81cfbf59f8f7a70231167","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5690336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliz Erdal","original_name":"Eliz Erdal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c81d0e0e7d9a05b8e3035e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5690336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliz Erdal","original_name":"Eliz Erdal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c81d278586916072869299","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5690336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliz Erdal","original_name":"Eliz Erdal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c81d3576c84c2649f2212d","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36042663","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9cDirU2d6OpXC6XXjbccGIRQwgc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
