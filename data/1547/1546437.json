This special documentary charts his poignant but fun-filled journey around the football grounds that have provided the backdrop for so many remarkable commentaries and football stories from this unique broadcaster, famed for his love of a sheepskin coat.  Along the way, the film features the key characters that have played starring roles in those famous Motty commentaries – starting with Hereford legend Ricky George. The programme relives some of Motson's immortal commentary lines, with the stories behind them, from ‘The Crazy Gang have beaten the Culture Club’ at the 1988 FA Cup final to ‘things are getting better and better’ when England won 5-1 in Germany.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/4XHUhiIdRiR2G9Dv7mcma7avn32.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A look back at the career of the BBC football commentator John Motson.","title":"Motty: The Man Behind the Sheepskin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1952377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josephine McCusker","original_name":"Josephine McCusker","popularity":0.448,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c7165348bc753283868434","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8388932","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ue95qr9oXyeKBWBCwDD7QFE59fU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1471,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4XHUhiIdRiR2G9Dv7mcma7avn32.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3754,"name":"legend"},{"id":333328,"name":"sport"},{"id":352822,"name":"football"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
