Three sisters that are very knit together but have opposing\r views, that are very close but live far apart, one in Tel Aviv, one in Paris and one in Bogot√°.\r A film about how the passage of time affects us, about accepting death, both our own and\r that of those who shared their lives with us.\r Director Joyce Ventura films herself and her two sisters over many years, reflecting on the\r aging process, acceptance of one's own death and that of our loved ones, and exposing\r the anxieties that come with facing the end of life. The three very different sisters, each\r living in different cities, contrast their opposite existential perspectives and personalities.\r Old age, a life stage that we often choose to ignore but inevitably concerns us all, is\r narrated in first person with humor and sensitivity.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Director Joyce Ventura films herself and her two sisters over many years, reflecting on the aging process, acceptance of one's own death and that of our loved ones, and exposing the anxieties that come with facing the end of life.","title":"Tres Hermanas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
