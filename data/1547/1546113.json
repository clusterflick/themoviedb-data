Inger returned to the source novel by Prosper Mérimée for inspiration, framing the action through the eyes of a child observer and stripping the story to its universal themes of love, passion, and the consequences of violence.  Kayoko Everhard shines as Carmen, supported with aplomb by Daan Vervoort as Don José and a superlatively polished supporting cast — including the dancers of the Spanish National Dance Company—in this alluring production from La Rochelle’s La Coursive. Curt Allen Wilmer’s dynamic set design and Tom Visser’s expert lighting highlight the drama of this treasured tale as you’ve never seen it before!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/l5q02kmL9St8GKGlzQihpYRw5VN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carmen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kayoko Everhard","original_name":"Kayoko Everhard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Carmen","credit_id":"68c62202cda8e3e269e2fb01","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daan Vervoort","original_name":"Daan Vervoort","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Don José","credit_id":"68c6223c72b11f7db5ca6c5e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leona Sivôs","original_name":"Leona Sivôs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The Child","credit_id":"68c62248f30ab16ee2a0f091","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaac Montllor","original_name":"Isaac Montllor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Escamillo","credit_id":"68c6225cfa33bf0d1dc8fc9f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toby William Mallitt","original_name":"Toby William Mallitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Zuniga","credit_id":"68c6226f541fe0d6c1230ad2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687734,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Johan Inger","original_name":"Johan Inger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c62145d31d352a2eca6c5f","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3861448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Lebard","original_name":"Stéphane Lebard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c621ad5ff6bc956270d0d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467019,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Inger","original_name":"Johan Inger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c621b7f3323b474e21fe23","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2850705,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Curt Allen Wilmer","original_name":"Curt Allen Wilmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c621cda0653a5ec8a0f095","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2869686,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Tom Visser","original_name":"Tom Visser","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c621e4249d983a38ca6c59","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l5q02kmL9St8GKGlzQihpYRw5VN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
