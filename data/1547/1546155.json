As they cast lines into still waters, the father reflects on a formative trip from his own youth — a day spent fishing with an old friend and a stranger who knew his father — revealing a tapestry of memory, connection, and legacy that stretches across three generations. Just Fishing is a meditative, intergenerational drama about the quiet rituals that bind us, the stories passed down between casts, and the realization that sometimes, the most meaningful moments are the ones that seem the smallest.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"When the Sun Hits the Top of the Trees","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
