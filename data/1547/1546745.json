The setlist was heavily focused on that album, featuring fan favorites like \"Cherub Rock,\" \"Rocket,\" \"Today,\" and \"Disarm.\" They also included the \"Gish\" track \"I Am One\" and the single \"Drown.\" The show is well-regarded by fans as an excellent example of their live sound during that period, characterized by loud, dynamic guitars and a tight, aggressive performance.  The band was part of a strong lineup that day, which also included acts like Rage Against the Machine, Björk, and The Breeders. Notably, the Smashing Pumpkins' set concluded with an epic and lengthy rendition of \"Silverfuck.\" The performance is often cited by fans as one of the band's top-tier live shows, with strong vocal and musical performances from the band. The energy of the crowd and the band's stage presence contributed to a memorable and intense experience.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4BhXacdwfskf88ibS2X1NFZHUjL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Smashing Pumpkins – Live at Pinkpop 1994","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Corgan","original_name":"Billy Corgan","popularity":0.2512,"profile_path":"/gTH99rnaJ4Xu7LtvsFU4RYOC21H.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Guitars / Vocals","credit_id":"68c7e5a15fa699e85b8686e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87052,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Iha","original_name":"James Iha","popularity":0.1531,"profile_path":"/sX0qFY0ZKCT0cDoj6whzKgMbXc2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Guitars","credit_id":"68c7e5ae14d552911586877e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Chamberlin","original_name":"Jimmy Chamberlin","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/mSpxngoEWZBwmcA1lJni9MF9ztZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"68c7e5d848bc753283868661","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"D'arcy Wretzky","original_name":"D'arcy Wretzky","popularity":0.1893,"profile_path":"/gESTtaiqLyOQAuwuqZZBxUpWv2W.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"68c7e5ec6e1b3941ede30187","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4BhXacdwfskf88ibS2X1NFZHUjL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1994-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
