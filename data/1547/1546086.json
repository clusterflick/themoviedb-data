Her old life was easy - at her old school she was popular, but now, all this fitting in stuff seems weird. Mom tells her to join clubs. But it's not that easy... Dodgeball team - Ouch! Debate team - Yikes! How about the ABC's (the AntiBullying Committee) - not a chance. A group of desperate losers want her to be in their rap video. Sounds like fun, but does she dare? And when getting too friendly with the chess club nerd threatens her chances with the popular girls it seems she might not fit anywhere. Is she brave enough to stand on her own and be herself?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gtr0GDQlLmPcf2q8Ip31mdTld9I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249645,"logo_path":null,"name":"young actors project","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Caroline's been told a million times \"be yourself.\" But how do you do that if you don't know who \"yourself\" is yet?","title":"Thirteen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687651,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Randall","original_name":"Robert Randall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c60945171c0487c1ef6570","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Randall","original_name":"Robert Randall","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c6095c925a2c41d3e61799","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Randall","original_name":"Robert Randall","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c6104c941c7878ffb74a74","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eUSSmWGSPOeRZSzV9rVfPdVXXH6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gtr0GDQlLmPcf2q8Ip31mdTld9I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
