After returning from Europe in 1977, Virgilio Aviado’s vision found a crucial collaborator in veteran actor and producer Michael “Mike” Parsons. Their partnership led to \"The Monastery\", an art workshop in Baguio, which soon became a crucible for their joint creative endeavours. Significant arrivals from Japan—an etching press and a brand new 16mm SLR Canon Scoopic—further solidified their multimedia aspirations.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1978 Footages","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael “Mike” Parsons","original_name":"Michael “Mike” Parsons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Michael “Mike” Parsons","credit_id":"68c5d49845cc068bd4e2059b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5687344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virgilio \"Pandy\" Aviado","original_name":"Virgilio \"Pandy\" Aviado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c5d1abfe0122310e78fd35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
