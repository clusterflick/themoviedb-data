I. Gurdjieff. It will certainly take a prominent place among the growing archives of one of the 20th century's seminal spiritual teachers.  Conceived by Michel de Salzmann before his death in 2001 and brought to fruition by Lubtchansky, The Seekers of Truth resonates with a clarity and economy that present a compelling introduction to Gurdjieff, his life and his teaching. The two voice-overs, one a neutral voice-over, the other acting as Gurdjieff's, give an objectivity and an intimacy that matches the material.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Seekers of Truth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
