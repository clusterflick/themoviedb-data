Ray Harryhausen en España","overview":"It analyzes the role Spain played as a natural and technical set for numerous international shoots. From the deserts of Almería to the coasts of the Canary Islands, and through the studios of Madrid and Barcelona, it explores the reasons why productions like those of Ray Harryhausen—undisputed master of stop-motion—found in our country the perfect ally: unique landscapes, talented technicians, and competitive operating costs. The documentary doesn’t just list locations; it also recreates, with archival photographs and period testimonies, the atmosphere of those shoots and their impact on the local industry.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mtqbfpAUS4oumd9paFFAhOijFCI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tras las Huellas de un Gigante.
