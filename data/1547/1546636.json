Through delicate visual compositions, the video captures the fleeting essence of existence, inviting viewers to reflect on the passage of time and the inevitability of change. It embraces decay not as an end, but as a transformation—where fading becomes a quiet act of splendor. A fusion of experimental animation and photography, Nothing Blooms offers a sensory journey into the fragile yet profound moments that define our perception of life’s impermanence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nothing Blooms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5689871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mourad Hamla","original_name":"Mourad Hamla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c7881e51615055bd70d775","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
