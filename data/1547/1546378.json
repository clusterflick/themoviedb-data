This lively ritual is not only a sign of respect and remembrance for the dead, it also allows family members to share Buddhist merit with their departed relatives and make sure they cross safely into a heavenly abode. “Woe betide those who are not guided on their journey,” warns one singer-performer, “they will find themselves wandering henceforth forevermore.” Compellingly and discreetly filmed in well-composed camera shots, this documentary invites the viewer to take a seat amid this fascinating Karen ceremony.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bone Whisperers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eim Chan Thar","original_name":"Eim Chan Thar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c780d8417dfccb60230f54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
