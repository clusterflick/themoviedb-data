With its combination of O'Sullivan's striking imagery and first-hand accounts by those who were there, \"Somewhere Below 14th & East\" chronicles an extraordinary time where boundless possibility and stifling desperation intersected to create one of the most vital and creative times in New York's history.","popularity":0.1714,"poster_path":"/fNnTpr3OzqhsCU2tneYcs1vcldn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In remembrance, of old New York.","title":"Somewhere Below 14th & East: The Lost Photography Of Karen O'Sullivan","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1919912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Miret","original_name":"Roger Miret","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/peCtpEggeV0BYMcVuustdUBUfsR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68c82e9b148db5a5cfca7532","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1919911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinnie Stigma","original_name":"Vinnie Stigma","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/XJpyo2JNsVsY8HOsqUku2RyuDg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68c82ea5053d2d4067ca74a4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2564313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Drescher","original_name":"James Drescher","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68c82ebdaa51a72771e3035f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harley Flanagan","original_name":"Harley Flanagan","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68c82ef55e59d5fd602311d5","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":770,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fNnTpr3OzqhsCU2tneYcs1vcldn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":264039,"name":"nyhc"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
