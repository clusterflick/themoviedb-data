Over the next decade, she travels between Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile, recording conversations, reunions and silences that reveal how exile reshapes names, memories and loyalties.  Objects, old tapes and family stories become clues linking Chile to Palestine, mapping a lineage scattered by migration yet bound by remembrance. Moving between present-day encounters and the images that began it all, the film pieces together a living portrait of kinship and loss. Intimate and quietly political, it shows how personal testimony can restore a history that borders tried to sever, and how memory, once set in motion, draws distant homes closer.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is Beit Sahour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234338,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fernanda Chain Fuentes","original_name":"Fernanda Chain Fuentes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c6cd23054dba7f3070d301","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3191518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Emiliano Díaz","original_name":"Martín Emiliano Díaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c6cd47665a085d0f70d33e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234338,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fernanda Chain Fuentes","original_name":"Fernanda Chain Fuentes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c6cd989fc9ced421f21c31","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3191518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Emiliano Díaz","original_name":"Martín Emiliano Díaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c6cda4c8d42f6d45868365","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234338,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fernanda Chain Fuentes","original_name":"Fernanda Chain Fuentes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c6cdcbf30ab16ee2a0f315","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27774033","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
