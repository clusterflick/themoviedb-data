On one side, there is Anton while the other side is lead by Mahmud. Maulana, the village boy whom Anton has adopted, falls in love with Laila, the sister of Mahmud. This love affair irritates Majid, Mahmud’s right-hand man, because he has loves Laila, long before her meeting with Maulana. Maulana and Laila refuse to take sides between the two opposing sides, and try to reconcile them. But a battle is inevitable. In the end, Mahmud kills Anton; but Mahmud dies at the hand of Maulana, his future brother-in-law. Then Maulana runs to Laila’s house and confesses. Laila forgives him, but Majid cannot. He orders a boy to steal the gun of Sabeni, an informant, and he shoots Maulana with it. While the intention was to make this film a musical, it didn’t work as the “realistic world” and the “musical world” could not blend fully.","popularity":0.1801,"poster_path":"/i4lJj1HNaIvpoHzE3Ide86f5FhS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149151,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Artis Jaya Film","origin_country":""},{"id":149152,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Matari Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1975-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laila Majenun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2106309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Achmad Albar","original_name":"Achmad Albar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Anton","credit_id":"5b717ec60e0a267ef6190440","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1687652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parto Tegal","original_name":"Parto Tegal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mahmud","credit_id":"5b717ecf925141406818da67","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1500182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deddy Sutomo","original_name":"Deddy Sutomo","popularity":0.0952,"profile_path":"/pVIvvZZOEVoqh2wcIKUCIDjHiuH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maulana","credit_id":"5b717ed9c3a36818971850df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rini S.
