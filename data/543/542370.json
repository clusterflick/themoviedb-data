Departing from the weird experience of being a “language strategist” in a modern work-place, it sketches out multiple systems of words, symbols, diagrams, gestures and ex-changes – only to deconstruct them, and constantly return us to the realm of “pure signifiers”, the noise that exist before any identifiable meaning, the lines and colours that precede a recognisable image. In a world of logos designed to emotionally manipulate us, Segal values our perceptual freedom.","popularity":0.082,"poster_path":"/eO08TMwXm40NnmIlRFyU1vk2VTy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmy Wiktora","origin_country":""},{"id":238632,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2018-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Key, washer, coin","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","title":"Llave, arandela, moneda","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1756544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miel Bargman","original_name":"Miel Bargman","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/dnapElNW12rP8OtRaeRCa3k3xfn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66df727ca39142ebafc4a987","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2873037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Martín Segal","original_name":"Alan Martín Segal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66df7288e8b22937c74d2c64","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1803983,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Samuel Breslin","original_name":"Samuel Breslin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66df729ef3ea651adb49435b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4933439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Minujín","original_name":"Ana Minujín","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66df72b5963cf72f062bd4d3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2873037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Martín Segal","original_name":"Alan Martín Segal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66df71b8eee697d1f82a29c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1433780,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pablo Bernst","original_name":"Pablo Bernst","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66df71ca3c3d986a756d226e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1409989,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Manuel de Andrés","original_name":"Manuel de Andrés","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66df71e308e045161a921bed","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2873037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Martín Segal","original_name":"Alan Martín Segal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66df71f8a27dde7efb9be7d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eO08TMwXm40NnmIlRFyU1vk2VTy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5aMwzrgUuC7M90ZRJcTtZPmWTQC.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine de Mar del Plata","release_date":"2018-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"NYFF","release_date":"2018-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
