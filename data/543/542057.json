When team owner Mike Ilitch moved the Tigers into Comerica Park in 2000 with the help of public funds, it marked the end of an era -- but it didn't erase the affection many fans still hold for one of America's last remaining classic-era ballparks. This documentary celebrates Tiger Stadium's rich history, recounts the long struggle to keep the team from abandoning the old park, and takes a critical look at its current state of neglect.","popularity":0.2941,"poster_path":"/l0OWRUn6g9NkLKIBVbbmx7cw8ir.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Battle To Save Historic Tiger Stadium","title":"Stranded at the Corner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2105916,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Bak","original_name":"Richard Bak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b70cf7f92514103410884cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2105923,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Hood","original_name":"James Hood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b70cff4c3a368188817d908","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2105918,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"E Alan Contino","original_name":"E Alan Contino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b70cf950e0a267ef6182c42","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2105911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Glaser","original_name":"Gary Glaser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b70cf5ac3a36818861ccadb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2105921,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Staub","original_name":"David Staub","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b70cfc0925141404f152ce8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2105924,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Comstock Riley","original_name":"Peter Comstock Riley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b70d00c0e0a267ee71923b7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2105922,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"James Hood","original_name":"James Hood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b70cfdf0e0a267ef818df57","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2105914,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Bak","original_name":"Richard Bak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b70cf6f92514140561526b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3636674","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l0OWRUn6g9NkLKIBVbbmx7cw8ir.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18021,"name":"detroit, michigan"},{"id":181327,"name":"detroit tigers"},{"id":246720,"name":"tiger stadium"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
