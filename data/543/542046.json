To help the viewer understand who he is and why his girlfriend left him, this neophyte filmmaker hires a temperamental actress to play his ex and together they reenact scenes from his failed relationship. During the course of filming, Michael's mistakes, blunders and inadequacies as a boyfriend are mercilessly pointed out to him. This Is Not A Film is a romantic comedy about making a mistake and recognizing it in the most painful way possible - by making it all over again.","popularity":1.0668,"poster_path":"/r3T3767YCgHS7Y4tzPFyT129mWB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":218698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laughing Circle","origin_country":""},{"id":218699,"logo_path":null,"name":"R.I.P.E.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is not an actor.
