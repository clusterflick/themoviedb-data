It starts late at night, during sleep. The sounds describe the nocturnal images - agitated animal-like bodies, empty streets and the allegorical scenes of a concealed reality. The film leads into the universal presence of nature and the human sphere of the senses. The film's rhythm changes in time and shows the transition from night to late afternoon in a Mediterranean ambiance. Playing with sudden fades from night to dawn, from tension to the carefree game of a spider, to flowers, bees and sheep in the rocky ground of the Island of Pag, and respecting silence as the natural flow of the events, this film makes one aware of the richness of change in the sublime ordinariness of a single day.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/aUIrzWl0pTRkpA9oBSf1q66LQaZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115256,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quadrum film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2001-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Day Under the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2250495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vlado Zrnić","original_name":"Vlado Zrnić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e931bdb875d1a0019440927","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2250495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vlado Zrnić","original_name":"Vlado Zrnić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e931be10231f20012040f8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0309491","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aUIrzWl0pTRkpA9oBSf1q66LQaZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
