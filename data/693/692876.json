Hauling along her decrepit mom and an equally cadaverous aunt, our heroine falls prey to a variety of libido-inspired stresses and also has a tragic debut at a disco club populated by repressed, trailer trash and ousted meteorologists. It's a fast moving trip from north to south with many odd detours for the viewer to relish.","popularity":0.136,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Fatal Desire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Enid Hagey","original_name":"Sarah Enid Hagey","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Julie Rogers","credit_id":"5e949de0d861af00192fc0bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Martinez","original_name":"Linda Martinez","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e94a42c2cde980014c600b4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","credit_id":"5e949e3d84448e001292765d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0464415","wikidata_id":"Q27733206","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
