The Williams were by far the most competitive cars in the Championship. Ferrari, the stars of winter testing, fell into disarray during the season and finished a distant third.  Benetton's highpoint was winning the Canadian race and introducing the most dynamic new driver of the season, Michael Schumacher, whilst newcomers Jordan performed superbly to take 'best of the rest' in the Constructorsâ€™ Trophy.  Ayrton Senna thoroughly dominated the early races of the '91 season, but it soon developed into a tense two-way battle as Nigel Mansell clawed his Williams-Renault into contention.  The official review somehow squeezes all the highlights of a dramatic and exciting year into 162 minutes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/o8fUSzTW82t86AC3Z0KgETxGbcA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"F1 Review 1991","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":990,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o8fUSzTW82t86AC3Z0KgETxGbcA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
