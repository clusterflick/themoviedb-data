The nationalistic attributes attached to these large-scale ceremonies are underlined in a non-descriptive and almost voyeuristic point of view. I, Soldier was shot at the National Day for Youth and Sports, the day that marks the start of the independence war of the Turkish public under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against the Allied Forces back in 1919. The annual ceremony held at the biggest stadium of each city consists of figurative dances of high school students, choreographed in a timeless socialist-realist manner. In the last decade, popular songs have replaced the usual military marches, which accompanied the choreography.","popularity":0.0427,"poster_path":"/oZvr9o3LRDgXrKHEmOQNxajjTCa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I, Soldier","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Köken Ergun","original_name":"Köken Ergun","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e91c29e15376c0015fdec3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Köken Ergun","original_name":"Köken Ergun","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e91c2d4180dea0013171d05","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2597630,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Wallmann","original_name":"Thomas Wallmann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e91c33800fb6b0013a31286","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2597628,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dirk van Lieshout","original_name":"Dirk van Lieshout","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e91c31437b3a900138c6dcf","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16492770","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1134,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oZvr9o3LRDgXrKHEmOQNxajjTCa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":756}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Special Mention, Zagreb Film Festival 2006","release_date":"2006-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
