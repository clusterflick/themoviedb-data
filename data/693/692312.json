One evening, a girl is killed at a party on the coast. Stefano was present at the party with some friends but omits to tell his father this. He fears that Federico will find out that he is gay, especially as the chief suspect is Damjan, an Austrian model with whom Stefano is having an affair. When Federico finds out that his son was present at the party, Stefano confesses that he is homosexual. Federico doesn't understand, thinking that he must have gone wrong somewhere in raising his son. However, as he gets to know Damjan and finally discovers the true culprit, he gradually comes to terms with his son's homosexuality.","popularity":0.094,"poster_path":"/mS3zcoq8R6OSbNWVTULf5w22a61.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":200,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mio figlio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luciano Odorisio","original_name":"Luciano Odorisio","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e92b060ccb15f00156e7982","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0444973","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.687,"height":980,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mS3zcoq8R6OSbNWVTULf5w22a61.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":673}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
