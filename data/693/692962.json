This same revival has made buying music more expensive, benefited established bands over independent artists and muddled the question of whether vinyl actually sounds better than other formats. Vinyl Nation digs into the crates of the record resurgence in search of truths set in deep wax: Has the return of vinyl made music fandom more inclusive or divided? What does vinyl say about our past here in the present? How has the second life of vinyl changed how we hear music and how we listen to each other?","popularity":0.4435,"poster_path":"/1EKYwUvMJ1Z7fmynHztPKehziSm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gilman Hall
