To highlight the disconnect between the fantasy of Los Angeles and the lived reality for many of its citizens, a computerized voice gives a dispassionate monologue over imagery that explores the truth of a city after the tourists, luxury stores and entertainment are removed from the streets. Through silent vignettes, the film leaves us with images of homelessness, and comments on the shallowness of capitalism and the hypocrisy of multiculturalism.","popularity":0.34,"poster_path":"/inoDG7YRPecKTwKIoZLowL8QTcy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132102,"logo_path":null,"name":"Our Secret Handshake","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Was Like A Dream I Remember from an Easier Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Burhenn","original_name":"Laura Burhenn","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e935b9f875d1a00124451fd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Burhenn","original_name":"Laura Burhenn","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e935bb0d55e4d001a199fb0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Lester","original_name":"Jason Lester","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/qPuOIeNkuUyBjgfrmi5VWkE9ehk.jpg","credit_id":"5e935b88875d1a00124451df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Lester","original_name":"Jason Lester","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/qPuOIeNkuUyBjgfrmi5VWkE9ehk.jpg","credit_id":"5e935b93ccb15f00156f7765","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2277148,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gus Bendinelli","original_name":"Gus Bendinelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e935bcd7a97ab00140d82df","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Lester","original_name":"Jason Lester","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/qPuOIeNkuUyBjgfrmi5VWkE9ehk.jpg","credit_id":"5e937d6fca4f6772c3801831","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31579,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heather McIntosh","original_name":"Heather McIntosh","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/kUT5Gtq0bPtoarB9f90KBbLG5bg.jpg","credit_id":"5e966b095c563400136d652a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2835,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/inoDG7YRPecKTwKIoZLowL8QTcy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1890}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":209674,"name":"moody"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nowness Pick","release_date":"2020-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
