He had a tough and awkward character and created a lot of problems every day, until his boss got angry and threw him on the street. Moses found refuge in a banditry and with his enormous physical strength it was not long before he was forced to become its leader.  Once, chased by the authorities, for his many crimes, he went to hide deep in the desert where the most famous ascetics lived. His fellowship with the saints slowly made him date. He was overshadowed by the Grace of God, because repentance is a time of Grace, his heart softened, he truly repented and asked for redemption. His change was radical and in a short time he reached the measures of the great Fathers of the desert.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/KXGmvkHwJXeHVM3k8u93iD2d2u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elpis Film","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saint Moses the Ethiopian","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/KXGmvkHwJXeHVM3k8u93iD2d2u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
