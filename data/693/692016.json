They met in the \"Young Front\" - illegal Democratic organization. After protests in December 2010, they were put in prison. After detention in a KGB pretrial center Nasta was sentenced to a year of probation, and Dmitry was thrown in jail almost for three years. During his detention Dzmitry’s mom died, and Nastya remained the sole support for his father. The young couple married in prison, and on August 28, 2013 the leader of the \"Young Front \" was released. The lovers wrote thousands of letters to each other from behind the bars. These letters tell us about the feelings of young Belarusians, who fell in love in the time of the dictatorship.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":117526,"logo_path":"/iKueQHLIkBg9NsBHV09z2srKu2B.png","name":"Belsat TV","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2014-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love In Belarus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2597572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viachaslau Rakitski","original_name":"Viachaslau Rakitski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e91bca3befb09001abd2781","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2265202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Kutsila","original_name":"Andrei Kutsila","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bbaJkoIWWagwtMV08YtKQjpVHzI.jpg","credit_id":"5e91bce237b3a900138c6331","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Russian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Russian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ru\", \"native_name\"=>\"Russian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
