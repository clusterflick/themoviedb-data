Mansell left nothing in reserve as he piloted his Williams-Renault to nine wins and fourteen pole positions: his winning margin was more than 50 points over team-mate Riccardo Patrese.  With no Alain Prost, Senna’s McLaren-Honda team off the pace, Ferrari still in the wilderness and Jordan replacing both of their 1991 drivers, ‘92 proved to be a year of turmoil for most of the grid. The exceptional team was Benetton whose young driver Michael Schumacher was proving to be a force to be contended with.
