Small architectures appear and overlap. Brief nebulas arise, the most complex structures sometimes recalling constellations and other stellar clusters.\r This abstract film shows the results of a year of visual and technical researches. Hand-drawn animations  were scanned,  manipulated and combined. The resulting images were printed on paper and reworked, then put in relation according to their level of complexity and the movements which constitute them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nPcrDAeha0sOhWWjcIpdtBvGSaC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"M","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Félix Dufour-Laperrière","original_name":"Félix Dufour-Laperrière","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/o8ptiTaEeIch6OCHbo6WUuqMbe9.jpg","credit_id":"5e94bb3166a7c30016033a39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1127,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nPcrDAeha0sOhWWjcIpdtBvGSaC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":751}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
