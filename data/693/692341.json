Mozart was commissioned by Gottfried van Swieten to modernise the score fifty years after Handel’s popular composition (1742), mainly by arranging the wind parts and partially re-composing them.  With Marc Minkowski a conductor has been engaged who understands perfectly how to combine baroque style with the tonal possibilities of an orchestra of the classical period like the Musiciens du Louvre. The excellent soloist quartet with Elena Tsallagova, Wiebke Lehmkuhl, Richard Croft and José Coca Loza merges perfectly into Wilson’s enormous flood of images.","popularity":0.2867,"poster_path":"/zvao01lv6Z1wi3NjcGGmgzBObqE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2027,"logo_path":"/rvHnU0XJniilOjf6IK9ZdXTUKE5.png","name":"3sat","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":26290,"logo_path":"/o7QeTO6M5CLKZP7RYuIxoHbTqET.png","name":"Unitel","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2020-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Händel
