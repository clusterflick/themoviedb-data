An early industrial music pioneer, Turman’s archival work has recently been getting reissued all over the place via Dais, Spectrum Spools et al. Obsessed with the loop, Turman has his own voice and navigates his sounds with alchemic skill.  Swirling, hypnotic patterns are seen through images of architecture, design and movement, the visuals looped along with the soundtrack, which sounds remarkably appropriate considering it was recorded twenty years after the fact. But Turman doesn’t dwell too long, he keeps both his audio and visual loops from becoming too static, both moving enough to captivate completely for the 33 minute duration of the release.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/l7tSsNUCyHnAa0h3ToycmajMjZ3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spirals of Everlasting Change","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2600602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Turman","original_name":"Robert Turman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e94e9dd66565a0019baa128","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l7tSsNUCyHnAa0h3ToycmajMjZ3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
