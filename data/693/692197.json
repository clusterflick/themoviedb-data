With Honda out, McLaren became a Ford customer team, it was the end of a legendary pairing.  Senna persisted in what seemed to be an impossible task, trying to stay in contention with the returned Prost and the runaway Williams-Renault.  Other notable performances come from the talented Schumacher who deserved better results; Hill, who repaid the support of his team; Barrichello, who did not have the chance to show his potential and Mika Hakkinen who displayed future World Champion qualities with just three appearances.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cUq786w0cAY5dLRhYVldfuGxEGH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"F1 Review 1993","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":991,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cUq786w0cAY5dLRhYVldfuGxEGH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
