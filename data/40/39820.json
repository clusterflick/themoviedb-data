Oswald whistles for the princess, who blows him a kiss as she appears on a balcony. He reaches her by lassoing the balcony and tying the other end of the rope to his horse's tail, using it as a tightrope. A rival knight suddenly appears and Oswald falls off the balcony, startled. He manages to climb back up and the two fight for the princess.","popularity":0.2681,"poster_path":"/vu3iAFqyQYBYdwQYqPzj8ADlBj1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171657,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walt Disney Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh, What a Knight","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Caballero al rescate","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe47339251416c9106d54f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1419055,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike Marcus","original_name":"Mike Marcus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54cc6564c3a3687f8f000a2c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0019227","wikidata_id":"Q3349855","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vu3iAFqyQYBYdwQYqPzj8ADlBj1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dZFS54q3b7aAwjDAngvuE4RJre8.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iYqHDCRFweIS4WMqVbHJg9dSBST.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/aQbvcVhKNDYY6cuqJW3wECQ7xqS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/vppvPWbBXS5NLfEYAMsi0nMslMm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1928-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
