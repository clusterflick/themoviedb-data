For three days, more than a thousand children and adults were held hostage in a sweltering gymnasium, denied food and water, and forced to keep their hands over their heads. The harrowing siege ended on September 3 with a series of explosions and a hail of gunfire that killed some 350 people - half of them children. In this film, the youngest survivors of Beslan tell their story.","popularity":0.1088,"poster_path":"/faR7eWZc0d4HPVvSh2tzZ4nNoSO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of Beslan","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1391445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ewa Ewart","original_name":"Ewa Ewart","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/yWs9VdGub6IODUAnST7ct6IdWWT.jpg","credit_id":"547aa77a9251412990003d81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Woodhead","original_name":"Leslie Woodhead","popularity":0.0736,"profile_path":"/hUfCPWqclnfpLvDw2K0ykUowJnb.jpg","credit_id":"5e645927151c5c0017fed294","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0480753","wikidata_id":"Q47004712","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":753,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/faR7eWZc0d4HPVvSh2tzZ4nNoSO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB","release_date":"2005-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
