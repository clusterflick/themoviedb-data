Frustrated that, between his job and his family, time is no longer his to manage and play with, Boogie now takes his shock dosage of freedom and spends a night to tick off all the items on the map of his youth (drinking, games, flirting, prostitutes). In the morning, after the disillusionment of the remake he experiences with his former friends, he returns to his wife.","popularity":0.7008,"poster_path":"/e3zU3mtfoZbUx9i0I6ZpxLVpTt6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13020,"logo_path":"/kXQRJWdpNbJBoCbmgCZpaW7VskK.png","name":"Multi Media
