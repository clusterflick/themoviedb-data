Unbeknownst to Tom and the audience, Jerry is asleep across several of the high-note keys inside the instrument, so Tom's playing eventually wakes him. Jerry is pummeled by hammers, bounced by wires, and squeezed by Tom as the cat tries to play the concerto while dispensing with Jerry. Jerry's defensive antics add to the brio of the program and answer Tom with Jerry's own skillful musical attack. By the concerto's end, the duet leaves only one animal standing for the audience's applause.","popularity":1.3646,"poster_path":"/eHo7MBlBMzG5nyLJ1jGRXUzBljP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89238,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGM Cartoon Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cat Concerto","video":false,"vote_average":7.586,"vote_count":162,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Tom & Jerry: Kattkonserten","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"猫的协奏曲","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le concerto du chat","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137486,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fred Quimby","original_name":"Fred Quimby","popularity":0.2035,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47369251416c9106dbef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13594,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph Barbera","original_name":"Joseph Barbera","popularity":1.2363,"profile_path":"/16UhnbVLaX9QBtcnjLH6hrdzq4F.jpg","credit_id":"52fe47369251416c9106dbe3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Hanna","original_name":"William Hanna","popularity":0.7365,"profile_path":"/zf5WRsouQN0ozuJ4vFosXylPjaZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe47369251416c9106dbd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149100,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Irven Spence","original_name":"Irven Spence","popularity":0.1011,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66167cdcc7a7e0017d068b74","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149095,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ed Barge","original_name":"Ed Barge","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66167cd1d8f44e0163df8cba","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149098,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kenneth Muse","original_name":"Kenneth Muse","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66167ccafac50201480af811","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137562,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott Bradley","original_name":"Scott Bradley","popularity":0.155,"profile_path":"/AjQ95xfBtFc39ADKaPi1jupim2m.jpg","credit_id":"66167cedfac502017b0bd0c6","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0039251","wikidata_id":"Q887569","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/35aiI9OqdkcR1E4l0AjilaKN7FA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7vvjgWlWdSkiaKe47RypQX8k6WC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tnsQcLXL4NT224p30aC35h9BkdM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eHo7MBlBMzG5nyLJ1jGRXUzBljP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dbxrUX2aFqRgXf3EnM04QsA0KKy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":15284,"name":"cartoon cat"},{"id":155325,"name":"cartoon mouse"},{"id":191028,"name":"concert pianist"},{"id":207592,"name":"piano"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1947-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tom and Jerry - The Cat Concerto - Pãram..... pãram ...","key":"YQred-1IDHc","published_at":"2009-10-01T21:11:22.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"533ec69bc3a3685448004a1c"}]}}}
