They earn their living off the earth and a few animals they feed. Fathers always prefer one of their sons. Mothers command their daughters ruthlessly. Ömer, the son of the imam, wishes hopelessly for the death of his father. When he understands that wishful thinking does not have any concrete results, he begins to search for childish ways to kill his father. Yakup is in love with his teacher, and one day after seeing his father spying on the teacher he dreams too, like Ömer, of killing his father. Yıldız studies and tries to manage the household chores imposed by her mother. She learns with irritation about the secrets of the relationship between men and women.","popularity":0.9063,"poster_path":"/rNFveNOjsQPSjacdQ6kNzJfP6ib.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27104,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imaj","origin_country":""},{"id":5901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlantik
