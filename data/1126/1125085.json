Regardless of poverty, fear of deportation, daily harassment, sexual violence and gender identity crisis, their love towards each other, keep them fighting for a better life in Turkey. We follow their challenging journey and transformation from scratch through registration for Turkish residency, seeking help in NGO's and even \"adopting\" a new member to their self-made family from the streets. As their life seems to get better from the outside, unexpected and darker perspectives surface, and leave the audience to question the muddy waters of ethics between victimhood and becoming a perpetrator.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/Awy5LxZXZikOiSwo7QgS4HNgKDa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transformation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4055137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlsen Miriam","original_name":"Carlsen Miriam","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645bcaa36aa8e0011ca2beaa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4055136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saeed Mayahy","original_name":"Saeed Mayahy","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645bca9b3fe16000e329b444","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27478383","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l11DQF7CSbeINhrwCyITS1LZ6ks.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/Awy5LxZXZikOiSwo7QgS4HNgKDa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
