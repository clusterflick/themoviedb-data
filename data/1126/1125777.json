Setting himself a target of four weeks to cast, rehearse and direct a West End production of Romeo & Juliet, Paterson plans to show the world that Harlesden is not what people assume and prove that Shakespeare can be brought to any place, any people and any time by using a cast of all first time actors. In the background director Baz Luhrmann looks on and offers Paterson advice on how to bring Shakespeare alive for modern actors and audiences.","popularity":0.4901,"poster_path":"/qvPpmYtbvGfbBKlgpDbWRtaZ72B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Shakespeare: Romeo & Juliet for a New Generation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lennie James","original_name":"Lennie James","popularity":0.9288,"profile_path":"/hfZrdEkBHxYYbMoGHAaVomlgMi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"645da319ef8b3200fe793546","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baz Luhrmann","original_name":"Baz Luhrmann","popularity":0.7406,"profile_path":"/8K8ih7uFyGanOApYYzlzdxzcfDF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"645da3239590e300e3a2574b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paterson Joseph","original_name":"Paterson Joseph","popularity":0.8463,"profile_path":"/7CIVAl4HiuWrmp4r8Jk09sqxTBy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64ad88f7e24b9300aee3fd24","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1615627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Waldman","original_name":"Michael Waldman","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645da2e69590e3018afdf477","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0443593","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qvPpmYtbvGfbBKlgpDbWRtaZ72B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
