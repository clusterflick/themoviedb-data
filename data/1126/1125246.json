The book analyzes the process in which former \"revolutionaries\" become petty bourgeois. Wanting to imitate the classical bourgeois class in Serbia (which they destroyed with genocide, ethnocide, culturocide and urbanocide), they only manage to reach the level of provincial petty bourgeois. Their world resembles the world from Branislav Nušić's comedies. The quasi-elite even has fun with the characters and situations, recognizes themselves and enjoys their stupidity. Two horses in front of the National Assembly unsuccessfully try to prevent other \"horses\" from entering. The absurdity of what is happening in today's National Assembly even exceeds the imagination of Nušić.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/hNimHsfbnh04w1SqM2cvwDEL9Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dunav Film","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1990-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Branislav Nušić","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jovan Jovanović","original_name":"Jovan Jovanović","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645c37483fe16000fed0a905","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4055838,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Zoran Nikolić","original_name":"Zoran Nikolić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645c36e177d23b00e2f6f9de","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4055840,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vlada Milenković","original_name":"Vlada Milenković","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645c36f3156cc7011e01ca7a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jovan Jovanović","original_name":"Jovan Jovanović","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645c37171b70ae01260e1c6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1527189,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stjepan Zaninović","original_name":"Stjepan Zaninović","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645c372b77d23b0119e263e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1527189,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stjepan Zaninović","original_name":"Stjepan Zaninović","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645c37513fe160011bed753b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":823,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hNimHsfbnh04w1SqM2cvwDEL9Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":549}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sh","note":"","release_date":"1990-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
