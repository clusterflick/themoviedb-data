The spiritual dimension of the séance is captured with black and white video cameras dating back to the early 1970's that create visually stunning artifacts of light trails, black halos, and scan lines that swirl endlessly into the unknown.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Rose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2021867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bobby Abate","original_name":"Bobby Abate","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645c41ecfe077a5cafbe313e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
