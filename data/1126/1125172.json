Dozens of Armenian asylum seekers trying to survive while waiting for their application to be considered. They left behind them a country whose people have settled around the world for over a hundred years ... A country all described as desert, abandoned by its inhabitants, emptied of its life. Forced stillness, impotence, they live in an in-between space: between two countries, between two lives. In a time and abstract space, made of nothing, where their life escapes them completely. By the shore, they float in limbo.","popularity":0.0645,"poster_path":"/ziJKICfb0tHPcqH4dluMcY9KCdj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cosmographe Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":199750,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visan","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those from the Shore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1770949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Stepanyan","original_name":"Tamara Stepanyan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645c023277d23b01365f0373","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5490508","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ziJKICfb0tHPcqH4dluMcY9KCdj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":526}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
