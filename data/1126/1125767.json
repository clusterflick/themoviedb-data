Her first instinct points toward Amber's boyfriend, Griffin, who had previously interrupted her boxing session while looking for Amber. Before Sam could start a fight with him, her trainer named Reid (also Amber's dad) intervened and made Griffin leave. Sam drops off Amber back at her house after spending the night and as Sam is about to drive away, she sees Griffin approach the house. Amber meets him outside and tried to get him to go away, but Reid comes out and makes him leave again. Reid takes Amber inside and before Sam can drive away, she hears yelling from inside and goes to investigate. Upon entering the house, she sees Reid hit Amber and she intervenes. Reid and Sam get into a fight where Reid almost knocks her out, but Sam gets the upper hand and takes him down. Amber helps Sam stand up and takes her to a hospital.","popularity":0.0671,"poster_path":"/sLSHjJ3v2Js6iJsfn1q08KTFEtQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boxed
