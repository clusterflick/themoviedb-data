As a hallmark of Finnish ethnic culture, rag rugs and their makers hold special places in the hearts of Finnish America.  Cultural sociologist Michael Loukinen brings us into the homes and to the workrooms of traditional weavers in Michiganâ€™s Upper Peninsula. He portrays the interwoven world of cultural beliefs, aesthetic practices, and family history that each rug represents. From the treasured family-memory heirloom, from each carefully protected rug to its threadbare, tattered clump on a tractor seat, these rugs are an art form that embodies several Finnish American cultural values.","popularity":0.1193,"poster_path":"/t3Dc7NO5CtleP2QiTTlcFDDVaBt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199824,"logo_path":null,"name":"Up North Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finnish American Rag Rug Weavers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3946375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Maier","original_name":"Alex Maier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645cf81d1b70ae0145efabdb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3812956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Loukinen","original_name":"Michael Loukinen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645cf64077d23b01703967f2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4056577,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kristin Ojaniemi","original_name":"Kristin Ojaniemi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645cf65dfe077a5cabd27912","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3812956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Loukinen","original_name":"Michael Loukinen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645cf59577d23b01365f892c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3946375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Maier","original_name":"Alex Maier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645cf8291b70ae0166bf766b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26659808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2127,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t3Dc7NO5CtleP2QiTTlcFDDVaBt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1418},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kgoEBjWkAhH3Lv5zzLHJz8gky40.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Finnish American Rag Rug Weavers - Official Trailer","key":"72IgZKSzfM8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-11-18T21:37:04.000Z","id":"645cf5516aa8e000e4bec0d6"}]}}}
