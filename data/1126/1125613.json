Dick is just ignorant enough about art to be impressed with this buncomb, and takes Dorothy to the Cubist.","popularity":0.1416,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It is a fine feature for a farce and is carried out cleverly and with unction.","title":"The Post-Impressionists","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Nelson","original_name":"Jack Nelson","popularity":0.1447,"profile_path":"/287tmZiqPIXmMr1p88x2wBenWf2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dick Carew","credit_id":"645d32243fe16000e32a6b87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Weed","original_name":"Frank Weed","popularity":0.0926,"profile_path":"/pnZATaW6qWMUzP8teop6IFP9vPr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"David Carew - Dick's Father","credit_id":"645d3233fe077a5caedb5456","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winifred Greenwood","original_name":"Winifred Greenwood","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":"/8SWn1KVvN1FU5slv6xtpk1DGto6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dorothy Wilton","credit_id":"645d3243156cc700ffa99b07","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lafe McKee","original_name":"Lafe McKee","popularity":0.1904,"profile_path":"/iDR6BFkx3vJY9dN3LA3bNTAK24J.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"George Wilton - Dorothy's Father","credit_id":"645d3252fe077a5cabd2952f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4055234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Evans","original_name":"Rose Evans","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Miss Spinks - Dorothy's Aunt","credit_id":"645d32676aa8e000e4bedc6b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Lonsdale","original_name":"Harry Lonsdale","popularity":0.1399,"profile_path":"/xEq7ssiVJJAfsQk8gMgDclt79Cp.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Professor Le Marex","credit_id":"645d32756aa8e0011ca3735e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hardee Kirkland","original_name":"Hardee Kirkland","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/ye5vaJ6CCGmpxRUog4tieuJFUtC.jpg","credit_id":"645d32073fe16000fed144ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1409009,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maibelle Heikes Justice","original_name":"Maibelle Heikes Justice","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/8gLHsqRkaUimZ18xFfvZ0RUY1Jr.jpg","credit_id":"645d3213bcf8c900e49a53f4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0234502","wikidata_id":"Q20803174","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
