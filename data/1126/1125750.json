The film reveals art forms so radically different from familiar folk traditions that the artists -- \"Tin Man\" Charlie Lucas, Vollis Simpson, Thornton Dial, Bessie Harvey, and \"Sandman\" Lonnie Bradley Holley -- defy classification. Variously known as \"outsider\" or \"visionary\" artists, they create unique aesthetic forms that challenge traditional distinctions between \"fine\" and \"folk\" art.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/vEDsdbjWtZrJK0BuyO7PxfQtodD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boneshop of the Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4057326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bessie Harvey","original_name":"Bessie Harvey","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"645d8fbfef8b3200fe792499","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4057327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thornton Dial Sr.","original_name":"Thornton Dial Sr.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"645d8fd788b14801756666d7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4057328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie 'Tinman' Lucas","original_name":"Charlie 'Tinman' Lucas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"645d8fe288b1480136feb78d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1675860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lonnie Holley","original_name":"Lonnie Holley","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"645d8ffbaafebd0144a3a82a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4057329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vollis Simpson","original_name":"Vollis Simpson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"645d9010aafebd018b68b8ea","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4057325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Crocker","original_name":"Scott Crocker","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645d8f9def8b32011b46616a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0487194","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2914,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vEDsdbjWtZrJK0BuyO7PxfQtodD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1946}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
