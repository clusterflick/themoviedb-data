On his way to an important meeting, his elevator gets stuck. What starts out as a mere technical difficulty turns out to be a catastrophe of much larger proportions. Bit by bit and with his cell phone being the only source of information as he is trapped between floors, Claudio realizes that the world as he knew it has completely gone down the drain. Once familiar faces have turned savage and blood-smeared. A lethal virus is transforming people into highly contagious, homicidal zombies. Trapped inside a metal cage, with the ravenous ghouls out to get him, Claudio must rely entirely on his wits and survival instincts to break out of this hell on earth.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
