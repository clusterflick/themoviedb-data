Flashbacks from the past strike Prabhat as he looks at that corner where the two of them used to hang out before. Meanwhile Ahan discovers the diary that he gave Prabhat a long time ago. Prabhat still carries it. There is an uncomfortable familiarity. This is all too overwhelming for either of them to make meaning of. Ahan retires to bed.
