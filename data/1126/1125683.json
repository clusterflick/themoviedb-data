So the strong arms of youth carry old age gently to the armchair in the sunlit room for a last meeting with all her kith and kin. There came the rural types known to that modest old cottage, and then that more sacred circle of grandsons with their wives and little ones.","popularity":0.1918,"poster_path":"/6VvAFx2l55sHKRFXvOZsrrQF4KL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Granny's Old Armchair","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1650160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Hamilton","original_name":"Vera Hamilton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Granny Willard","credit_id":"645d5eb8156cc7015e79476b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Stowell","original_name":"William Stowell","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":"/fYVk4U0LqoHVWFhnT6UDO3hkqPL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tom Willard - Granny's Grandson","credit_id":"645d5ec73fe16000e32a7892","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winifred Greenwood","original_name":"Winifred Greenwood","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":"/8SWn1KVvN1FU5slv6xtpk1DGto6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sallie Willard - Tom's Wife","credit_id":"645d5ed8ad50f0011b6cac3c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4057060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Johnson","original_name":"Clarence Johnson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Walter Willard - Tom's Son","credit_id":"645d5eee77d23b4e7f8a02df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin Wallock","original_name":"Edwin Wallock","popularity":0.1345,"profile_path":"/wP5rS9fdDkWcK8vIMDdjZKMnjfC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sam Willard - Another Grandson","credit_id":"645d5efcbcf8c901383c6e66","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Gallop","original_name":"Gloria Gallop","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Martha Willard - Sam's Wife","credit_id":"645d5f0c77d23b4e7df21555","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lafe McKee","original_name":"Lafe McKee","popularity":0.1904,"profile_path":"/iDR6BFkx3vJY9dN3LA3bNTAK24J.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Simon Willard","credit_id":"645d5f1cbcf8c900feece3e0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4055633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Flynn","original_name":"Thomas Flynn","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Hy Green","credit_id":"645d5f2e6aa8e000e4bee84d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Hazelton","original_name":"Joseph Hazelton","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/k8JYpRuw3AImsThQHQW8G4CYmhM.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Doctor Jones","credit_id":"645d5f40bcf8c90172056008","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3955633,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Lane","original_name":"Chris Lane","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645d5ea8ad50f001722b4cc2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hardee Kirkland","original_name":"Hardee Kirkland","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/ye5vaJ6CCGmpxRUog4tieuJFUtC.jpg","credit_id":"645d5e983fe16000e32a7887","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0460182","wikidata_id":"Q20004931","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r3X9zasVHRWux4piYLRBELDDdWa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6VvAFx2l55sHKRFXvOZsrrQF4KL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
