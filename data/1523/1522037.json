Old photographs and a modern- day train trip through the Balkans highlight the coincidences, the similarities, and the affinities that link Balkan filmmakers. A film about all the things that unite the neighbouring countries of the peninsula, which, perhaps, are many more than the things that divide them.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/g4TFGDlMwERy210dEoiLVfgYONR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birthday Celebration, or a Silent Balkan Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Glenti genethlion i Mia vouvi valkaniki istoria","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Banquet d’anniversaire (Histoire muette des Balkans)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1602208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fotos Lambrinos","original_name":"Φώτος Λαμπρινός","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68890859194920532bcf03dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1602208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fotos Lambrinos","original_name":"Φώτος Λαμπρινός","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6889086871137d444bcf0371","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150337,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dimitris Nollas","original_name":"Δημήτρης Νόλλας","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68890873a934db57eeed0152","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0258618","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g4TFGDlMwERy210dEoiLVfgYONR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
