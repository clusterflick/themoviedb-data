At the lavish Beverly Hills estate, Dick’s four adult children, the eldest and scatterbrained Dick Jr., glamorous Penny, the ambitious Tyler, and youngest of the clan Cedar, come together for what they assume is a standard will-reading by their father’s eccentric and unconventional attorney Harvey Zuckerman. Instead, the group finds themselves embroiled in a bizarre and absurd scavenger hunt orchestrated by their late father, who has left his substantial $60 million fortune to whichever of them can solve his carefully devised riddle first.","popularity":0.15,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":269499,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Frontier Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":269500,"logo_path":null,"name":"Savant Artists","origin_country":""},{"id":269501,"logo_path":null,"name":"EMRMedia Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Run Amok","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Roberts","original_name":"Eric Roberts","popularity":2.3177,"profile_path":"/NiWg1TaUcal7xn1ZQeyA2dLd5F.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dick Muck","credit_id":"6888fe49d493fd62c7ed0113","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bronson Pinchot","original_name":"Bronson Pinchot","popularity":0.8077,"profile_path":"/oBQE58X65ANq4jY1d8iMDohl72w.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Harvey Zuckerman","credit_id":"6888fe62f8cd4800b9eec7fa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3458159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander James Rodriguez","original_name":"Alexander James Rodriguez","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":"/kAadm8iWWfL9WmUSyzwCVagkTen.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Cedar","credit_id":"6888fe6f3bf67e6c33b8ccd4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5328624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colter Ford","original_name":"Colter Ford","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Dick Muck Jr.","credit_id":"6888fe8718bb5717daed011e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3857171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Hess","original_name":"Kate Hess","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/xEdlLsyWbGSL95XPzW26tZqyDoU.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Penny","credit_id":"6888fe973bf67e6c33b8ccd8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5570086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Finn Sanders","original_name":"Finn Sanders","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6888fea75e2059b61feec7e8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5594096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benji Patterson","original_name":"Benji Patterson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Tyler","credit_id":"6888feb66ffc813cdede1204","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3455931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Truman Hanks","original_name":"Truman Hanks","popularity":9.0145,"profile_path":"/6ERfNyCNxGWnsTniEM8bfMk8TsL.jpg","credit_id":"6888fd76aa0f431c25cf033c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3455931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Truman Hanks","original_name":"Truman Hanks","popularity":9.0145,"profile_path":"/6ERfNyCNxGWnsTniEM8bfMk8TsL.jpg","credit_id":"6888fd801fa557fd45de11c0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Bonnell","original_name":"William Bonnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888fd930e2987d1c0fe1837","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Bonnell","original_name":"William Bonnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888fd9f991bdad4cdb8cd41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Bonnell","original_name":"William Bonnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888fdc505e04b2cdceec80b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3455931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Truman Hanks","original_name":"Truman Hanks","popularity":9.0145,"profile_path":"/6ERfNyCNxGWnsTniEM8bfMk8TsL.jpg","credit_id":"6888fdd341954b9741cf032d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1842482,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sebastian Twardosz","original_name":"Sebastian Twardosz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888fdeaf8cd4800b9eec7f0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37729577","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
