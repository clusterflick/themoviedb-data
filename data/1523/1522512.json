When she retired in the mid-1990s, activism became a new calling, even though she had never voted before. Her weeks soon filled with protests, meetings and campaigns.\r But as life tends to do at unexpected moments, it throws Betty a curveball - she injures herself at a large protest and must be\r homebound for months. The documentary follows Betty through several protests and her three-month recovery, leading up to her preparation for a large protest against the war in Iraq.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ikMUTB0uPN9VFEIWfByOFNIKILx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"IN BED WITH A MOSQUITO is an intimate portrait of activism and aging in New York City.","title":"In Bed with a Mosquito","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ikMUTB0uPN9VFEIWfByOFNIKILx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
