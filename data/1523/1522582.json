Three Tours is a documentary film that captures the lives of these three veterans as they work to heal the wounds and battle with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) resulting from their direct experience with the traumas of war. Told through their own voices, Three Tours documents their profound transformation from U.S. military trained killers to agents of change advocating for proper mental health treatment of veterans and an end to unjust wars.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8JPJl5WRaay1JkBZwctdrLlzbuz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Three US. militaray veterans work to heal their wounds and battle with PTSD resulting from their deployments in Iraq.","title":"Three Tours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Betty Yu","original_name":"Betty Yu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688a541deda54843a5d0263d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8JPJl5WRaay1JkBZwctdrLlzbuz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Three Tours - Trailer","key":"591789514","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-08-24T20:20:43.000Z","id":"688a5524db2a05193cb26d95"}]}}}
