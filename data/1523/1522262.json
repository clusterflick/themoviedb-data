Each collection functioned as a wearable narrative—rooted in personal memory, cultural identity, and material experimentation—moving beyond trends into emotional storytelling and bold materiality. Under creative direction by Massimiliano Giornetti (with mentorship from An Vandevorst and Tim Blanks), the show embraced unconstrained innovation: sculptural silhouettes, unexpected textiles, and global perspectives in fashion as pure creative expression.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Graduate Show 2025","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15479,"name":"fashion"},{"id":167198,"name":"fashion show"},{"id":171206,"name":"graduate"},{"id":182410,"name":"haute couture"},{"id":220225,"name":"menswear"},{"id":333862,"name":"runway"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
