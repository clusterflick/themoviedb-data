It explores how dance, in all its forms, reflects both personal expression and collective identity - shaping how we connect, communicate, and grow as human beings. At the center of the film is a unique question: What makes us human? This perspective opens a broader reflection on how we define ourselves physically, emotionally, and spiritually and where our shared potential as a species might lead.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5Vk4noEzcHvJu3k0QBzyv2HY3Xf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246079,"logo_path":null,"name":"In-Edit
