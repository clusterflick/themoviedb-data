This film, directed by filmmaker and tenor Andrew Staples, immerses viewers in Alice's imagination and her connection to Field's music, offering a rare glimpse into the artist's mind during the creative process. The interplay between historical venues and the custom-designed digital landscapes at Munich's Hyperbowl LED studio creates an atmosphere where the intangible becomes vividly real, resulting in a film that is much more than just a performance; it is an exploration of a performer's journey through the music of a neglected composer who left the world one of its most beloved musical forms: the nocturne.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":269665,"logo_path":"/oHX1wDmB5O71UlOY3ww3owo2XGJ.png","name":"Studio2359","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":269666,"logo_path":"/eznCap7GJuDvug1gBWFAbYuzQNl.png","name":"Tez Arts","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":269667,"logo_path":null,"name":"HYPERBOWL","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NOCTURNE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Alice Sara Ott: Nocturne","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3348447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Sara Ott","original_name":"Alice Sara Ott","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zspqnfUcEz0ene9DjIYkTTdOJD0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"688ac9c70f4e91b81b3353ef","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Staples","original_name":"Andrew Staples","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688ac9cfc0980a34bd767bb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5597031,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Field","original_name":"John Field","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688ac9e733c5cbc36f767c22","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2522,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ludwig van Beethoven","original_name":"Ludwig van Beethoven","popularity":0.2442,"profile_path":"/bSyMM4Y7qWLKMvDuynPJ3mn3Pup.jpg","credit_id":"688acaad2be7fa8c283353cd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"STAGE+ Premiere","release_date":"2025-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"STAGE+ Premiere","release_date":"2025-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Alice Sara Ott - Field: Nocturne No. 2 in C Minor, H. 25 (Making Of Video)","key":"lRkcD-lH7nI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2025-03-18T11:15:02.000Z","id":"688acccc2be7fa8c283353f5"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Alice Sara Ott: Nocturne â€“ A film by Andrew Staples (Trailer)","key":"MxnDd7uSQy8","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-02-12T14:31:54.000Z","id":"688ac54aaedd0c22bf5e2f9f"}]}}}
