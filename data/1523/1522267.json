Throughout the 1950s and 60s, Phoebe Smith (1939 - 2025) petitioned for fair treatment, but could not receive GRS (gender affirming surgery) legally in Georgia. After almost two decades of pleading for answers, in January of 1969 Phoebe flew across the country and walked across the border (into Mexico) hoping to finally make her transition. Realizing others might benefit from her experience, Phoebe wrote two well-received autobiographies (\"Phoebe\", 1979 and \"From Sharecropper’s Son to Who’s Who in America\", 1992) and self-published an almost 15 year run of the invaluable, worldwide newsletter, \"The Transexual Voice\" (TV, circa 1980 to 1994). Captured during her 80th year, Phoebe’s retrospective catalogs her journey, impact and integral role in 20th century Trans American history.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phoebe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37543198","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/f8AwrhK9zaQULrtiFnHyo71XQsy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":527}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
