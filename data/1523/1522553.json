The main character of the film is not a person, but an ordinary pencil, which becomes a symbol of the everyday actions and inner struggles of a young person growing up in a system of deeply corrupted values. The pencil leaves a mark of our thoughts, aspirations, and reality. Its smallest trace is a dot, a full stop. However, to come to a full stop with injustice is a necessary and at the same time a great act.","popularity":0.1571,"poster_path":"/cv4XjQJu1CetrlaurK8PwNWWaa8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Full stop!","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596158,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zita Damjanović","original_name":"Zita Damjanović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688a4ab0c4ba1112abd02637","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596158,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zita Damjanović","original_name":"Zita Damjanović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688a5171c4bea91d6a694577","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596158,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zita Damjanović","original_name":"Zita Damjanović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688a5265db2a05193cb26d8f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":757,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jGdL9Vaih84Ie2bzKMx58fNPMlg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1345}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cv4XjQJu1CetrlaurK8PwNWWaa8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":194451,"name":"social issues"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"},{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TAČKA!
