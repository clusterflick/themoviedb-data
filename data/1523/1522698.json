Donghan is accepted into a respected music college, but he drops out before completing even a semester due to biased behavior from professors. Haesook becomes hopeful about her son's independence. However the founder prioritizes the ensemble's marketability over the musicians' artistic growth, deeply distressing Haesook. Donghan receives an offer to work as a teaching assistant in an orchestra Haesook had previously known, and they dream of a new future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"A Cellist Coming to Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1939598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Hyuck-jee","original_name":"Park Hyuck-jee","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688a8d52f86e1db5a684c3ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
