Clarence Fitch was a man of and for his times, an African American who witnessed and took part in the social movements of this country from the turmoil of the sixties through the present decade. Telling a story fraught with both heroism and tragedy, the film situates Vietnam vet Clarence Fitch's life within the context of a remarkable range of issues--racism, the Black civil rights movement, the Vietnam War and its aftermath, the scourge of drugs, and finally the AIDS crisis. ANOTHER BROTHER both honors Clarence Fitch and digs deeply into the roots of his struggles.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/994Jw33uqzB43b8ROGx5U28Guzf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Through found photographs, audiotaped interviews and archival footage, ANOTHER BROTHER tells the story of Vietnam veteran Clarence Fitch.","title":"Another Brother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2240279,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tami Gold","original_name":"Tami Gold","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688a61b9b89a73b944b26d6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/994Jw33uqzB43b8ROGx5U28Guzf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
