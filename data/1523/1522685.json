It’s a gritty dive into the inner workings of a city’s infrastructure that embraces different formats, weaving newly digitized archival material together with surveillance footage and contemporary vignettes of people at work, communities in flux, and waste in motion. Observational, off-beat, and open-ended, the film finds harmonies and dissonance in patterns of creation, consumption, and renewal.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/eJEbUga1nOvlArFKxBvxxD7FqIx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Excess","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melissa Langer","original_name":"Melissa Langer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688a8ba77c6e03f8a901d67f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1498,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eJEbUga1nOvlArFKxBvxxD7FqIx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1064}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
