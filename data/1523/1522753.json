During the era of military dictatorship, the Blue House was a place of fear and inaccessibility. But as South Korea democratized, more and more people were allowed to approach it. I had grown up surrounded by countless protests, but it was the first time their sound followed me home. The never-ending noise made the house where I was born and raised feel unfamiliar. But the place they now stood was the very spot where I had held a candle to protest just months before. My right to raise my voice also guarantees theirs.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Blue Roof from the Window","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Living Across the Blue Roof (Blue House)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahn So-yon","original_name":"Ahn So-yon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688aaaf7f8b5ed6c2be13d2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahn So-yon","original_name":"Ahn So-yon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688aab30ad28ed9046581605","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
