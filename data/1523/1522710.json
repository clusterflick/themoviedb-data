Matsumoto Rika’s father was the guru of Aum Shinrikyo, the religious cult responsible for the deadly Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995 – mass murder that shocked Japan to the core. Rika was brought up with the cult. She has been exposed to discrimination and exclusion from society. Even though her trauma has driven her to the brink of suicide at times, she struggles to carve out her own life and identity. She eventually takes on a new challenge to become recognized not as \"his daughter\" but as \"Matsumoto Rika\" herself.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/n1VbnRVekVNs0SqfhEwnnJwoPZ3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2025-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Though I'm His Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rika Matsumoto","original_name":"Rika Matsumoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"688a92559f998eab2ea1a751","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yo Nagatsuka","original_name":"Yo Nagatsuka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688a917235acc78377d0261f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yo Nagatsuka","original_name":"Yo Nagatsuka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688a918a2c42ca02add0270b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yo Nagatsuka","original_name":"Yo Nagatsuka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688a919206926df0e001d5ef","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596611,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hiroyuki Kimura","original_name":"Hiroyuki Kimura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688a91b4f24f988f0c84c1bd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596615,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yuki Takeuchi","original_name":"Yuki Takeuchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688a9205bb82bb41c1581615","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"imhisdaughter"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kVp8uVNAsTbv276zbmcGo5kYFTd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/n1VbnRVekVNs0SqfhEwnnJwoPZ3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IMPACTE!
