It's delicious, low in calories and better still doesn't stain the family carpet... What's not to like? Well, for a start, it has a life of its own, and we're not talking friendly live bacteria...  Young Jason seems to be the only one who doesn't love The Stuff - in fact, he won't go anywhere near it, after having seen the pudding crawling around the fridge one night. What's more, everyone who eats The Stuff has started acting really weird... Now, teaming up with wise-cracking industrial saboteur Mo, Jason must put a stop to The Stuff and the organisation behind it or face a gooey, gloopy demise.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/oheIL2kpPVaLFo7ONmGGhSeaDBc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1950,"logo_path":"/eIoDtHIJKZaZ4hGbKgqC0PzlqJc.png","name":"New World Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":17069,"logo_path":null,"name":"Larco Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"ARE YOU EATING IT...
