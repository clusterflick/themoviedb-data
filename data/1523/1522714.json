The film moves from “episodes” of different lengths and moods/rhythms/melodies, without any apparent cause-effect, like life itself, which passes on (“passare” – to pass, to pass on) from one unpredictable event/emotion to another. Each ‘episode’ is based upon some feeling, event or place and is aesthetically resolved; but there are no links from one episode to another. The episodes may be as short as one second or as long as ten minutes; each is my subjective interpretation of actual incidents, places, feelings, etc. into the terms of pure temporal color. Everything is in actual chronological order.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passare I (Italia)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Sharits","original_name":"Paul Sharits","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/mlXPqhayQYvLv0sUQgOqXXiWS56.jpg","credit_id":"688a925a9f998eab2ea1a759","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
