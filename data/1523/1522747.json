For over 35 years, Shinpei and Hiroko Ishibashi ran a humble soup shop there. In 2020, large-scale redevelopment began in anticipation of the Tokyo Olympics. The elderly and unemployed were left behind, forgotten amid the city's transformation. Hoping to rebuildcommunity ties, Magokoro Yoshihira, a customer of the soup shop began cleaning the streets alongside the elderly. As Magokoro and the elders made a soup to serve, they begin to realise that what was truly passed down was not a recipe, but the time spent together—remembering, cooking, and reconnecting.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Disappearing Taste of My Second Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5596816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yutaka Kuwahara","original_name":"Yutaka Kuwahara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688aa71bf86e1db5a684c4a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
