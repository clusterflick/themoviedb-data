He told Sparky's dad, Mr. Paggert, he needed some boys to help carry provisions up into the mountains on a secret mission. It sounded exciting. The stranger was searching for a legendary lost gold mine and had a map which seemed to indicate exactly where the mine could be found. Sparky and his dad agreed to help the stranger carry equipment and supplies up into the mountains for his search. Nobody found a \"lost\" gold mine. What did happen makes this zestful animation film delightful viewing for kids. The boys demonstrate their Christian faith in times of need. They also have an opportunity to present the Gospel.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5ociusx7OnhrbV9G3LrDPzMo5zo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89185,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ken Anderson Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Gold Mine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":573540,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Arthur Davis","original_name":"Arthur Davis","popularity":0.2474,"profile_path":"/hNsp76FpjJFdtEeBOcnR0PSBNM7.jpg","credit_id":"68896520f7ae8329e7581128","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5008041,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edgar J.
