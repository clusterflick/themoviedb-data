Acclaimed journalist Jonathan Parker (Dean Roman Castiglione) accepts a mysterious invitation from Anastasia Vassiliev (Aylin Baykal), an ancient vampire intent on revealing her true nature to the world.  Jonathan arrives at Anastasia’s mansion in the Hollywood Hills, where he is welcomed by her loyal familiar, Penny (Alvin Soprano). Throughout the interview, Anastasia shares her personal history and her philosophy on vampirism, while introducing Jonathan to her adopted vampire daughter Natalia Svetlitskiy (Evie Campbell), who remains forever fourteen. As night turns to dawn, the interview takes a darker, increasingly unsettling turn—culminating in a revelation that changes everything.","popularity":0.1786,"poster_path":"/3WjZXx21ZTGecMKcncaMeH1bfP8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano
