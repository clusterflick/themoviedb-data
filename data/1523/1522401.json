A former nomadic society, the Saharawis, who have been under Spanish colonial rule for 90 years, were forced to flee their homeland when Morocco was invaded in 1975. Against all odds, they have sought to keep their culture alive while carrying on their fight to gain the independence of Western Sahara, the last colony in Africa. Through the lives and works of poets, singers and painters, Beat of Distant Hearts explores their collective experience of exile, loss and war and offers insight into how these art forms have played a role in the ongoing struggle.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":269583,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dakkuma Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beat of distant hearts (the art of revolution in Western Sahara)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
