It featured two sets: the first with John's 14-piece band, including backing vocalists and horn section, showcasing his flamboyant stage persona, and the second with the band joined by the 88-piece Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, with John dressed as Mozart. The concert highlighted his band lineup from the \"Leather Jackets\" album and featured new orchestral arrangements by James Newton Howard. The recording focuses on the second half of the show, with some tracks omitted. It marked the end of John's iconic stage costumes, a tradition he had maintained since the early 1970s, and was his last performance before undergoing successful throat surgery in January 1987, which would alter his voice and temporarily halt his touring.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zrT4WScZt6ikpSfnw49HcHzLoUZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elton John: Live in Australia 1986","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ghp21uCDcMopfa7H7oktug0r7ce.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1070,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zrT4WScZt6ikpSfnw49HcHzLoUZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":713}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
