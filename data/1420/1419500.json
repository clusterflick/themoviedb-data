To mark his 25th anniversary of being in power, this two-hour CBC News original documentary looks back at his life, from the Cold War to the ongoing war in Ukraine, and examines key turning points in his career to reveal his evolution from an unknown KGB agent to the all-powerful president of the Russian federation.  The documentary features dozens of former insiders, political leaders, exiled activists and liberated prisoners - many who have personally met and negotiated with Putin, or been victims of Kremlin policies that have crushed dissent and led to the devastating war in Ukraine.  Putin's Journey will take us up to the present day, as the Russian leader confronts a new American president, each bent on curbing the power of the other.","popularity":0.5242,"poster_path":"/1l9Q21lyX7KW0vkfQjlmazOacUq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238894,"logo_path":null,"name":"CBC News","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2025-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Putin's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5187523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Konstantin Eggert","original_name":"Konstantin Eggert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678ba1e2859fb4e6a86dd0d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172246,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luke Harding","original_name":"Luke Harding","popularity":0.133,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678ba25d1afc34646764ed19","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5187529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoya Sheftalovich","original_name":"Zoya Sheftalovich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678ba2871afc34646764ed3e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2600894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Khrushcheva","original_name":"Нина Хрущёва","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678ba2cdd8a5b0d00c43032e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1215272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Shprintsen","original_name":"Alex Shprintsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678b9df5dbcff33a9c64ef7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2888763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasiya Ivanova","original_name":"Anastasiya Ivanova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ba042a93ce48bca4306cf","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5187513,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Micheline Parent","original_name":"Micheline Parent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ba0be880f6bd3846dc88d","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5187514,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kevin Kirk","original_name":"Kevin Kirk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ba0d2880f6bd3846dc89b","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5027658,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ron Searles","original_name":"Ron Searles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678ba0ffa93ce48bca430720","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jjDXeH4KHwKNVePSbuZWj6icnew.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1l9Q21lyX7KW0vkfQjlmazOacUq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8570,"name":"president"},{"id":196034,"name":"vladimir putin"},{"id":213971,"name":"activism"},{"id":247987,"name":"kremlin"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Inside Putin’s dark rise to power | Full documentary","key":"leYExGi5iGo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2025-01-15T00:00:25.000Z","id":"678d37642e41634e526519fe"}]}}}
