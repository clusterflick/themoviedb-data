Barta was sent to document the lives of an agricultural brigade. Commissioned by the Ministry of Culture, the film was intended for screening in cinemas.  Eight days had been allocated for the full shoot, without prior recce. On the first day, the filmmaker gathered the men round a fire—without having informed the local mayor, the Party Secretary or the head of the SMA, as was customary at the time—and recorded their thoughts about their work: sound only, no images. Once that was completed, the remaining days were dedicated to collecting images of the community.","popularity":0.055,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":155806,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studioul \"Alexandru Sahia\"","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Intrepid Men and Their Complex Machines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3055645,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tereza Barta","original_name":"Tereza Barta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678baf70d094ea7af14309e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3055645,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tereza Barta","original_name":"Tereza Barta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678baf7b880f6bd3846dcc09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5187615,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Valentin Ilie","original_name":"Valentin Ilie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678baf917c7047471b42fa25","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2476103,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Radu Zamfirescu","original_name":"Radu Zamfirescu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678bafab1afc34646764f086","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4452342,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elisabeta Dragomir","original_name":"Elisabeta Dragomir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678bafc91afc34646764f09d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5187618,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Marin Puceanu","original_name":"Marin Puceanu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678bafe4d8a5b0d00c43088e","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4618785,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chiriță Ion","original_name":"Chiriță Ion","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678baff91afc34646764f0c2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5187619,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victor Lombardo","original_name":"Victor Lombardo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678bb0161afc34646764f0d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102364,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ioan Pelz","original_name":"Ioan Pelz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678bb021880f6bd3846dcc3b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5187621,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Elena Cezar","original_name":"Elena Cezar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678bb036d094ea7af1430a62","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4618311,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rodica Mihăilescu","original_name":"Rodica Mihăilescu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678bb04cd8a5b0d00c4308ab","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ro","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
