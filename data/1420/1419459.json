Over the course of months, and with the help of a 12-person team of animators, Demand carefully constructed a model of the ship's dining room in his signature media: paper and cardboard. In a painstaking process, he then brought the set to life through stop-motion animation. Demand meticulously retraced the movements of each item in the room—from chairs and tables to lemon slices at the bar—and recorded each shift in a single frame. The combined total of 2,400 frames creates a continuous film. The process resembles a technologically advanced version of Eadweard Muybridge's early animations of animals in motion. Devoid of human actors, Pacific Sun results in a surreal, stylized, but oddly familiar film that evokes memories of disasters at sea.","popularity":0.077,"poster_path":"/vTC4289Q7SCtXBMJUqyPQ0lFBgT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pacific Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3250895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Demand","original_name":"Thomas Demand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678b841242f27c754c64e6cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vTC4289Q7SCtXBMJUqyPQ0lFBgT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1499}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
