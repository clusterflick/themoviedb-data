Growing up felt like a safe pink bubble to her. But this bubble burst when she discovered the obstacles her parents had to overcome to have a child. For example, one mother did not exist legally for 12 years, and 30 years later this is still the reality for multi-parent families. When Afra heard this, she became determined to tell the story of these families. This documentary shows what happens to you when you fall outside the 'standard' picture of a family. In the film we follow Afra, and her two mothers, two multi-parent families, the experts Henny Bos (professor of Sexual and Gender Diversity in Youth), Sara Coster (board member Meer dan Gewenst and child wish coach) and former D66 member of parliament Lisa van Ginneken.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/xxej1MkOoXEFvYSihTuMraF7qt3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roze Bubbel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5279308,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marleen Danhof","original_name":"Marleen Danhof","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c49c54defa42aa0f4b20e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5279307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Afra Rijkhoff","original_name":"Afra Rijkhoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e3e84e7db9e70c47dca3e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rXXkFxuEQRo27ALbFtaJpTQvmVF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wx1Uqp5FRujFg2mu27JQeAHlbw9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5QGAGsliPiKHSLi2bYqA0fPZWtv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/xxej1MkOoXEFvYSihTuMraF7qt3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":224000,"name":"lgbt parenting"},{"id":280179,"name":"lgbt rights"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
