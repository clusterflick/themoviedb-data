He lives with his mother, and attends the CRIS (Social Reinsertion Center) every day, where he lives with other users with similar diagnoses such as Bea, a hyperactive woman who will become his best friend, or Hippie, who dreams of becoming a rock singer. Together with Miguel, an actor with a serious personal crisis, they create a theatrical show, inspired by texts by Samuel Beckett. What begins as a CRIS workshop, will end up becoming a way to freely express their emotions and feelings.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5rXusErB9omKuN1ff9fMdzVqlif.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beckett y el rinoceronte blanco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adán Aliaga","original_name":"Adán Aliaga","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678bfb635add61273d64fd08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30424148","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5rXusErB9omKuN1ff9fMdzVqlif.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1575}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
