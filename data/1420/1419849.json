Made from newly rediscovered images of San Francisco, cities and towns, and places throughout California where nature and culture meet, 02021's all-new show fixes on the history of our state's resources and the backbones that have made it work: transportation, extraction, communication, travel and labor.  California's many peoples, communities and histories all intersect in a panoramic poem documenting the past and suggesting possible futures in an age of climate and seismic uncertainty. As with all LOST LANDSCAPES events, the audience makes the soundtrack, and you are cordially invited to identify people, places and events, pose questions to one another and to the host, and engage in spirited conversation as the film plays.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Landscapes 02021: Earth, Fire, Air, Water: California Infrastructures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":996491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Prelinger","original_name":"Rick Prelinger","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678c5cbf880f6bd3846de83e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
