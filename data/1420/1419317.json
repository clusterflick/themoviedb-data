The Gospels and letters of the New Testament are vibrant evidence of this. In surprising ways, the Old Testament narratives and prophecies illustrate that they too are authentic records. The contrast between the laws of Moses and contemporary pagan laws is one evidence. Everything points persuasively to the conclusion that we can trust the Bible as an accurate record of Godâ€™s plan of salvation in the coming of Jesus Christ. We also respond to the challenge that Jesus of Nazareth never really lived!  Brian Edwards is a Christian minister, author, lecturer, and teacher based in the United Kingdom. His twenty books included historical biographies, Christian theologies, and apologetics. His wider ministry includes preaching and lecturing, both in the UK and abroad.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5fnV3qbpcmy6My8M0BF7ILbCSoF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Best of British Bible and Science Conference","title":"The Bible: An Authentic Book","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5186720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian H.
