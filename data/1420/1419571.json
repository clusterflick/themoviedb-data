As lands, forests and sea coasts are turned into battlegrounds for “development” women are drawn into movements to defend their right to their homelands, their own histories and their own understanding of an organic way of being. Jailed for their activities women experience violence from the prison system but they also find solidarities and deep friendships created and sustained in the time of incarceration which become life-long bonds.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Voice of Conscience","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
