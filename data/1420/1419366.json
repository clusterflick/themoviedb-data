In 43 minutes, the development of psychiatry \"in the third year after reunification\" is shown using two institutions in the new federal states as examples. A touchstone for all of psychiatry and disability care to this day. The film shows a shocking way in which disabled people are treated. The commentary uses the perspective of those affected. 50 years after euthanasia in Germany, this documentary reminds us of this once again.","popularity":0.616,"poster_path":"/q13tLzDzdCSWiRP4msUXtWsja2a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9291,"logo_path":"/g6GYZXQrjB86Z5ocVliUZF1i3Tz.png","name":"HR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hell of Ueckermünde","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Hölle von Ueckermünde - Psychiatrie im Osten","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Hell of Ueckermünde - Psychiatry in the East","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2297751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Klee","original_name":"Ernst Klee","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/kbePclqDJ5KMi4Hb9wg0SPCMe53.jpg","credit_id":"678b317eafcb32c49942f405","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2297751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Klee","original_name":"Ernst Klee","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/kbePclqDJ5KMi4Hb9wg0SPCMe53.jpg","credit_id":"678b31b72e41634e5264d6e4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5110954,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Beatrice Weineck","original_name":"Beatrice Weineck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678b43927c7047471b42f14b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2958390,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hans Evert Vennegeerts","original_name":"Hans Evert Vennegeerts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678b43a435902b0f936dc9e7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3320415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manfred Gerlach","original_name":"Manfred Gerlach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678b43c135902b0f936dca13","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5186874,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roland Rocke","original_name":"Roland Rocke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678b43f08bca661d0542fab9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4099938,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elke Scheckel","original_name":"Elke Scheckel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678b440d8bca661d0542fad3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5186875,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rosemarie Schütte","original_name":"Rosemarie Schütte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678b4444dbcff33a9c64e575","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5186877,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joachim Weiland","original_name":"Joachim Weiland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678b446508dd708bb96dd286","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vLch25TirXCnP65Tr7XjjQlij1o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":944,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/q13tLzDzdCSWiRP4msUXtWsja2a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10323,"name":"psychiatric hospital"},{"id":221825,"name":"german reunification"},{"id":273804,"name":"medical documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dokumentation - HR - Die Hölle von Ueckermünde","key":"bzKvfzscxWg","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-07-17T18:07:16.000Z","id":"678b7d072e41634e5264e1af"}]}}}
