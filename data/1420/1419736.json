Many of the artists who have defined Irish music in the past decades were there - The Chieftains, Clannad, De Dannan, Christy Moore, Mary Black - alongside such younger talents as Sinéad Lohan, Ashley Macisaac and Carlos Nuñez (some, like the latter two, hailing from the wider Celtic diaspora in Canada and southern Europe).  This DVD captures the cream of the performances from all of those involved and offers a panoramic view of the best that the Celtic scene has to offer the world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/NefNCaNiN8rJrARExB1lX9BRyG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live Concert of the Greatest Irish Artists: Gaelforce","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/NefNCaNiN8rJrARExB1lX9BRyG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":697}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
