A strange mix of both documentary and fiction, where in the future a group of people are looking back at the twentieth century. A virus has wiped out most of the culture of the twentieth century, leaving just fragments of a project called 'The Perimeter Fence' to be pieced together. These fragments make up a documentary about an exiled group of disparate yet similar minds.","popularity":0.1631,"poster_path":"/j7q4lCNPDVPSjODEkvyD3LJajB1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asylum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":554640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Moorcock","original_name":"Michael Moorcock","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a9cc3a368484e15d753","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1079766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Dorn","original_name":"Ed Dorn","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a9cc3a368484e15d757","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590473,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Sallis","original_name":"James Sallis","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a9cc3a368484e15d75b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1079767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Warner","original_name":"Marina Warner","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a9cc3a368484e15d75f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229247,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Keith Griffiths","original_name":"Keith Griffiths","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/o8L1E5SnGVsSVuwIv5m5WotVUQL.jpg","credit_id":"6260ffb563aad20051d24296","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iain Sinclair","original_name":"Iain Sinclair","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/itd7Mqaid9fsYnGZGCOhMpQdWWJ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a9cc3a368484e15d749","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iain Sinclair","original_name":"Iain Sinclair","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/itd7Mqaid9fsYnGZGCOhMpQdWWJ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a9cc3a368484e15d743","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1078794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Petit","original_name":"Chris Petit","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/jWIZPCUCjPWDlfQVkv4F0NLKO0G.jpg","credit_id":"5a557ab59251417a9d01a63c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1078794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Petit","original_name":"Chris Petit","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/jWIZPCUCjPWDlfQVkv4F0NLKO0G.jpg","credit_id":"5a557abac3a3685ebc0194f9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0275941","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2q2D6WMXlj1MIqUDx0vwS95rJKa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kBtC6XHHof9dTMWlPUVRIAqlLk7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j7q4lCNPDVPSjODEkvyD3LJajB1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
