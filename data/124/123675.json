It threatens to demolish the foundations of 20th century physics. Its authors are two of the world's leading cosmologists. If they're right, Einstein was wrong. It all began when Andy Albrecht and Joao Magueijo met at a conference in America in 1996.  This program began from Newtonian view of the universe then takes you through the General Relativity and the Flatness problem. This leads to the Horizon problem and its solution, the Inflation theory. However modern astronomy doesn't stop here, the Inflation theory has its flaw too, and what happened before the big bang? This can all be answered by changing one thing, the one thing no body dare to question until now.","popularity":0.2966,"poster_path":"/sklIE0BkTmCZsdhCd9eW81K7bDx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Einstein's Biggest Blunder","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Albrecht","original_name":"Andy Albrecht","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - University of California","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a368484e15d17b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Baldwin","original_name":"John Baldwin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - University of Cambridge","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a368484e15d17f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Durrer","original_name":"Ruth Durrer","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself - University of Geneva","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a368484e15d183","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078709,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Ellis","original_name":"Richard Ellis","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself - University of Cambridge","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a368484e15d187","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1078711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"João Magueijo","original_name":"João Magueijo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iLXSRCyi2jZCEcznjjxp3RzDdIr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - Imperial College","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a368484e15d18b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Wark","original_name":"Dave Wark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself - University of Sussex","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a368484e15d18f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":196658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Webb","original_name":"John Webb","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself - University of New South Wales","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a368484e15d193","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathew Zajac","original_name":"Mathew Zajac","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":"/eimpFgoPxaoUUqU87JmvwxlBY2T.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator (as Matthew Zajac)","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a368484e15d197","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Sington","original_name":"David Sington","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a368484e15d19d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1004220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":794,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sklIE0BkTmCZsdhCd9eW81K7bDx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
