The location is not fictitious but instead it’s the very real Fermoy in County Cork which is a welcome touch. Like much of 1980s smalltown Ireland it’s a claustrophobic place that drives people away but inexplicably retains a strange sort of hold on them. The latter is exemplified by Gina Moxley’s character, the tempestuous Mary Hartnett who has returned after a stint in London. The other members of their gang are languid Martin (Vincent Murphy), uptight Willy, and mousey Rosie who carries a torch for Phil.","popularity":0.1439,"poster_path":"/7Oj3oO8kjqtyfmqbmwZy7uIwW7f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clash of the Ash","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liam Heffernan","original_name":"Liam Heffernan","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Phil Kelly (as William Heffernan)","credit_id":"52fe4a94c3a368484e15b845","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":557128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Moxley","original_name":"Gina Moxley","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/wIWu317WbupJVCJfuF3Ycv67tRN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mary Hartnett","credit_id":"52fe4a94c3a368484e15b849","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinny Murphy","original_name":"Vinny Murphy","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Martin Hogan (as Vincent Murphy)","credit_id":"52fe4a94c3a368484e15b84d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1078697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myles Breen","original_name":"Myles Breen","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/1HW4oEeWdeHf5LbP6Dp19PwfQD2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Willy","credit_id":"52fe4a94c3a368484e15b851","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078011,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fergus Tighe","original_name":"Fergus Tighe","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a94c3a368484e15b841","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0318368","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1242,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Oj3oO8kjqtyfmqbmwZy7uIwW7f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":828}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
