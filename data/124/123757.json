Anna, a French actress studying in New York, crosses paths with a successful stock-broker, Mark, standing before a Vermeer portrait at the Metropolitan, thence ensues a peculiar romance of missed meanings and connections, with tangential asides to the steaming arts world and stock market, loft-mate conflicts, and, perhaps, love. Wrapped up in their blindered worlds, Anna and Mark deflect away from their chances, leaving at the conclusion the wistful face of Vermeer’s portrait enigmatically asking questions. All the Vermeers in New York is a comedy of manners which, as gently as a Vermeer, looks beneath the skin of this time and place, and of these characters.","popularity":0.4517,"poster_path":"/sQmBGBIjDvX2nMwUHI3yQv4YAJ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Complex Corporation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3906,"logo_path":"/iSK5VQnKq7ZZKI3ge9K1DySvJYm.png","name":"American Playhouse","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All the Vermeers in New York","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuelle Chaulet","original_name":"Emmanuelle Chaulet","popularity":0.1394,"profile_path":"/chPJ6A3Gha4XjJhlui0ckQjcoaF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"52fe4a9cc3a368484e15d71f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Lack","original_name":"Stephen Lack","popularity":0.1443,"profile_path":"/5rTcXgdYnF9GOT46cnOAjfXPCIl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mark","credit_id":"52fe4a9cc3a368484e15d723","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Garner","original_name":"Katie Garner","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Nicole (as Katherine Bean)","credit_id":"59e00516c3a36861a30ab995","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":167718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Phillips","original_name":"Grace Phillips","popularity":0.4635,"profile_path":"/iKYLiy2i18dvDGbCXOrKxpw7otV.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Felicity","credit_id":"59e00525c3a36861df0ba422","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurel Lee Kiefer","original_name":"Laurel Lee Kiefer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Ariel Ainsworth (as Laurel Kiefer)","credit_id":"59e0052f92514124c50aee14","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gracie Mansion","original_name":"Gracie Mansion","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Gallery Owner","credit_id":"59e0053792514124c90ae696","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Joseph Weiss","original_name":"Gordon Joseph Weiss","popularity":0.1194,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Gordon","credit_id":"59e0053ec3a368624d0a97c3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Ruffin","original_name":"Roger Ruffin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Max","credit_id":"59e00545c3a368620d09afc5","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Jost","original_name":"Jon Jost","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/kYXBWSdUTTGcmJWwMefeZ3nPYmb.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a9cc3a368484e15d71b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Jost","original_name":"Jon Jost","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/kYXBWSdUTTGcmJWwMefeZ3nPYmb.jpg","credit_id":"5509d1bfc3a3682b46003af4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":381120,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Henry S.
