The second film directed by the man who played the admirable lead role in Robert Bresson's A Man Escaped is a stylized and intense adaptation of a novel by Jean Giono. This police investigation in a 19th century village combines visual beauty with the rigor of the mise-en-scène—the vertigo of the criminal motivations indivisible from the refined graphics of the images.","popularity":0.2714,"poster_path":"/g3IiA459BcS1CD63KBNn40h84Jr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Jean
