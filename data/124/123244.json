Maybe your neighborhood. The Hutchins have a \"guestroom\" in their home. It's not exactly a business. It's a hobby. Or.....would you say religion? You see, Everett and Glory are practicing cannibals. It's a proclivity that you can't readily share with friend or neighbor. When Richard Ruebens answers Everett's classified add to buy a classic car, he becomes their latest potential meal. But......Richard has no intention of being a lamb led to slaughter.","popularity":0.441,"poster_path":"/mQoMNikm3IwLfat1Si9JixFCHWY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82248,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dance On Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You are cordially invited for dinner.","title":"Serving Up Richard","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Guest Room","type":"Original Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross McCall","original_name":"Ross McCall","popularity":0.7168,"profile_path":"/bUJgldKbFVlSIxxLbdViOxCS6Gd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Richard Reubens","credit_id":"52fe4a8fc3a368484e15a8cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":941433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Priver","original_name":"Susan Priver","popularity":0.1336,"profile_path":"/hYh0xsOANY4F1qBdTsOIxhKUkTn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Glory Hutchins","credit_id":"52fe4a8fc3a368484e15a8d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jude Ciccolella","original_name":"Jude Ciccolella","popularity":0.7175,"profile_path":"/sS506N50Brzyu0wgq18mk3pj4dH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Everett Hutchins","credit_id":"52fe4a8fc3a368484e15a8d5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1077552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Burke","original_name":"Brian Burke","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Stanley","credit_id":"52fe4a8fc3a368484e15a8d9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Olek","original_name":"Henry Olek","popularity":0.1325,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a8fc3a368484e15a8c9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Olek","original_name":"Henry Olek","popularity":0.1325,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a8fc3a368484e15a8c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1766143","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mQoMNikm3IwLfat1Si9JixFCHWY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
