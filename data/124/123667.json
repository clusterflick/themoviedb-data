The film features contributions from musicians including Laurie Anderson, Jarvis Cocker and Beth Orton; enlightening and often startling analysis from some of the world's most eminent birdsong scientists; a literary guide to birdsong in poetry; a bizarre birdsong-themed art 'happening'; the creation of a new musical composition from the Afro-Celt Sound System, entirely made up of manipulated birdsongs; and a strange musical duet at New York's Bronx Aviary, featuring humans and birds.","popularity":0.3564,"poster_path":"/7xCEJ6vJcB7WNA0tXBGs9eECa09.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Birds Sing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jarvis Cocker","original_name":"Jarvis Cocker","popularity":0.2281,"profile_path":"/i4EzLcmH0OPoEicgE4hasgFdkIl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4a9ac3a368484e15d109","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurie Anderson","original_name":"Laurie Anderson","popularity":0.2461,"profile_path":"/qzYxlXRWKJSa8Qbwt4bcaaUVtle.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"59065f13c3a3684b07020d05","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":154771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beth Orton","original_name":"Beth Orton","popularity":0.098,"profile_path":"/nSoGA6PfMPgUpOr0s6fZdLkBSKX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4a9ac3a368484e15d111","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078662,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Ramsden","original_name":"Sara Ramsden","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a9ac3a368484e15d105","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Archie Powell","original_name":"Archie Powell","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a9ac3a368484e15d0ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zUd9GBnbRjEtiNWSicKT3xcNzQK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3200}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7xCEJ6vJcB7WNA0tXBGs9eECa09.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
