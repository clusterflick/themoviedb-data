Shots are presented in their original order and length. Sound comes from picture locations. This is part of a filmmaking and film curating project to make films of the 50 US states using 16mm. I've invited artists to make other states. The Utah film is a part of this body of work.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2eblmhAuzG6SXzwRhOY7JznGfsI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Utah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2069800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Brown","original_name":"Kate Brown","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2c3ca2c3a3681237000491","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":1025,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2eblmhAuzG6SXzwRhOY7JznGfsI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":702}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
