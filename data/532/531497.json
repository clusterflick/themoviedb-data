This script, which preoccupied Guattari’s attention for seven years, represented a blueprint for a subversive popular cinema through an imagined hyper-intelligent infra-cellular life substance—“UIQ” (Universe Infra-quark)—capable of controlling global communications networks and plugging into the “desiring machines” of a community of squatters. After discovering the unpublished script, Paris-based artists and filmmakers Silvia Maglioni and Graeme Thomson initiated a multiform research project that culminates in their film essay In Search of UIQ, which takes on Guattari’s central quandary: how to give shape to a bodiless entity, seemingly without spatial or temporal limits.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/A1PwwYYq7Esla6GrkF6L6WBJ9kR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Search of UIQ","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Graeme Thomson","original_name":"Graeme Thomson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2c33c4c3a368123d0001c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvia Maglioni","original_name":"Silvia Maglioni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2c33b3c3a3681310000231","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.725,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sFvAEvtf8HQrF38BHKMm6qtgysu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":783},{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/A1PwwYYq7Esla6GrkF6L6WBJ9kR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
