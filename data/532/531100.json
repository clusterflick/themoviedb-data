King and other denizens of the deep south to talk about the blues. Interviewing local musicians ranging from inmates at Parchman Prison to a virtuoso guitar-playing barber, Ferris finds the genre cannot be pinned down to a single definition or origin. The blues permeates the territory as an infectious feeling, heard in musical notes thrummed from impromptu instruments like broomsticks and axes, in addition to guitars.","popularity":0.2816,"poster_path":"/eJsHbXiGwxjOBRnjkW33kJt5hSZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Give My Poor Heart Ease","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Give My Poor Heart Ease: Mississippi Delta Bluesmen","type":"Full title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"B.B.
