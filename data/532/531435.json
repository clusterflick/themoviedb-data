In 1973 concerts, the band left the stage after Act Two and a filmed version of 'The Hare...' was shown.\r A spoken-word comedic interlude (narrated by Jeffrey Hammond with an exaggerated Lancashire accent) backed by instrumentation. Presented as an absurd fable, the interlude details (with much wordplay) the failure of a group of anthropomorphic animals to help a hare find his missing eyeglasses.","popularity":0.3364,"poster_path":"/eTDRIEH5OUJYolrzYrssNqTaC1E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1973-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jethro Tull: Story of the Hare who Lost his Spectacles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Anderson","original_name":"Ian Anderson","popularity":0.2793,"profile_path":"/odGfLVeJ3CKoEE6YochUJGcYD0z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ca8d4519251411467fdafcd","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.733,"height":818,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eTDRIEH5OUJYolrzYrssNqTaC1E.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8lkc9RsZ1jfqBattwU1mNAsGaR8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"},{"id":193749,"name":"folk"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1973-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
