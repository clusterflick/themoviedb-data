Despite the abolition of slavery, Abina finds herself trapped in a society where the trade in slaves, particularly children, persists under the guise of protectorate laws. After being sold and forced to marry against her will, Abina flees to seek her freedom and confronts the British legal system. Her battle for justice is a poignant narrative that exposes the hypocrisy of the colonial powers and the resilience of those who fought against their oppression. Told through stunning animation, the film is a compelling historical drama that delves into the complexity of freedom, colonialism, and the human spirit's unyielding desire for autonomy and dignity.","popularity":0.4109,"poster_path":"/6HGfqvUJsH7Yu7JiucYUZWf7RiF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentary Film Institute","origin_country":""},{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In this evocative animated drama based on a true story, Abina, a tenacious young girl in 1876 West Africa, defies the remnants of colonial slavery and embarks on a perilous journey to reclaim her freedom.","title":"Abina and the Important Men","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Harris","original_name":"Gina Harris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator / Woman in Market","credit_id":"5b2e863e0e0a2657da00726d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Harry","original_name":"Toni Harry","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Abina","credit_id":"5b2e864fc3a3685344007ad5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dee Spencer","original_name":"Dee Spencer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eccoah Coom","credit_id":"5b2e8664c3a368534000834a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhonnie Washington","original_name":"Rhonnie Washington","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Man in Market / Quamina Eddoo","credit_id":"5b2e867c9251416e1b006a58","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1829388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Behrens","original_name":"Michael Behrens","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Magistrate William Melton","credit_id":"5b2e8694c3a3685335006d9b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sasha Whitaker","original_name":"Sasha Whitaker","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Constable Moosa","credit_id":"5b2e86ab9251416e290066ec","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soumyaa Kapil Behrens","original_name":"Soumyaa Kapil Behrens","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2e86d90e0a2657d400707f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7017858","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6HGfqvUJsH7Yu7JiucYUZWf7RiF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3012,"name":"court case"},{"id":2831,"name":"slavery"},{"id":234566,"name":"gold coast"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Francisco Black Film Festival","release_date":"2017-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
