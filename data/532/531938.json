His mind flashes back to an early memory where, as a toddler, his family try to take a photo of him in their backyard.  As he drifts in and out of sleep, his memory and the present begin to merge.  Dennis Tupicoff's 2017 short film premiered at the prestigious Annecy International Animated Film Festival.  The film's combination of hand-drawn animation with live action clips of the 1950 Film Noir D.O.A,, awakeness with sleep, and past with present creates a surreal quality that emanates throughout the film.","popularity":0.0466,"poster_path":"/4GuIH81bRRY6h2oLkIsJAxQRMuQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Photo of Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dennis Tupicoff","original_name":"Dennis Tupicoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2fb0bc0e0a26568c00609b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dennis Tupicoff","original_name":"Dennis Tupicoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2fb0c4c3a368584b004a2d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.649,"height":997,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4GuIH81bRRY6h2oLkIsJAxQRMuQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":647}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Annecy International Animated Film Festival","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
