Geraldine \"Jerry\" Howard has the claim to it left her by her father. Bill tells her that the death of the claimant, her father, makes a claim void. Infuriated, she goes to John Kenton, a crooked lawyer, for aid. Kenton sees an opportunity for wealth if he marries Geraldine, but Bill tells her that Kenton is only after her money. She gets more infuriated. While Bill and a posse are raiding an immoral cabaret, Kenton raids the Paradise freight depot to steal the money. The depot catches fire and Kenton shoots his henchman to save himself. The town and Geraldine think Kenton is a hero. It is up to Bill to prove otherwise.","popularity":0.2453,"poster_path":"/oz2mqMjUvr9db3U7nCsvkRrqIFP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40375,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metropolitan Pictures Corporation of California","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pals in Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolph Schildkraut","original_name":"Rudolph Schildkraut","popularity":0.1827,"profile_path":"/f8P8gAoYvAOtgxvE8rYyAgztSik.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Abraham Lezinsky","credit_id":"5b2ecdc00e0a2657d4009805","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bowers","original_name":"John Bowers","popularity":0.0933,"profile_path":"/j6KhoMBcaddOHhyuHjXIUxAyjzP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bill Harvey","credit_id":"5b2ecdcd9251416e4300822d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":128325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite De La Motte","original_name":"Marguerite De La Motte","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":"/lVTbD5zc5luU1vS64SPF2d7k8Ov.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Geraldine 'Jerry' Howard","credit_id":"5b2ecddbc3a368533800b03f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"May Robson","original_name":"May Robson","popularity":0.1967,"profile_path":"/pHAfACamrBpWcdMvOCE3Xc0666P.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Esther Lezinsky","credit_id":"5b2ecde80e0a2657e0009d41","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":183134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Brooks","original_name":"Alan Brooks","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"John Kenton","credit_id":"5b2ecdf70e0a2657bf009f51","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Adams","original_name":"Ernie Adams","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/zpKSSdsuDVofN1GAAbKnkn2GjrL.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Butterfly Kid","credit_id":"5b2ece040e0a2657e3009894","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Gordon","original_name":"Bruce Gordon","popularity":0.1214,"profile_path":"/qTyqhTYbKYFbbiEdZAwSKHScxaL.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Gentleman Phil","credit_id":"5b2ece1fc3a368532200ab1e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George B.
