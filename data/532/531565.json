Gareth is taking the Science class to see the Aurora Borealis but, while preparing Bessie, accidentally trips, knocks off the brake and tumbles from the train. As a cabin fire also breaks out, Gareth watches in horror as the train speeds off without a driver and the children on-board! The fire crew is called but their path is blocked by snow and ice and so Sam makes a bold decision, leaping from the helicopter to ski towards the runaway train. It’s a Race Against Time to stop the train before it reaches the end of the line!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/asSxVH0Wc6mjmBUiX2pqyIwj85x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fireman Sam Race Against Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/asSxVH0Wc6mjmBUiX2pqyIwj85x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
