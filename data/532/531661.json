Convinced that the former Liberal Party leader would be found guilty, a special post-trial programme was prepared. This was scrapped, however, when the jury returned its verdicts of not guilty for all defendants, and the programme has remained unseen for almost 40 years.  Edited and updated with new information about a fresh 2017 police inquiry into the case, Tom Mangold finally presents his story about how powerful political forces tried to protect Thorpe. The programme features revealing interviews from 1979 with Norman Scott, chief prosecution witness Peter Bessell and the alleged hitman Andrew 'Gino' Newton.","popularity":0.2263,"poster_path":"/3K1qQDoHB7262rJtCZwLNbYKiK7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jeremy Thorpe Scandal","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2070400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Mangold","original_name":"Tom Mangold","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5emElxPfNnJJafHwrO3rVOgFWvx.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b2d60320e0a2638730008ca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Scott","original_name":"Norman Scott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b2d617b0e0a263870000911","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2070402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Anderson","original_name":"Steve Anderson","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2d614dc3a3683710000abd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961385,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rachel Jupp","original_name":"Rachel Jupp","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2d6059c3a368370d000b88","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1840482,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stephen Foote","original_name":"Stephen Foote","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2d616892514102d7000901","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2070403,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karen Wightman","original_name":"Karen Wightman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2d615a0e0a2638670008e6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2070402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Anderson","original_name":"Steve Anderson","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2d61350e0a263855000985","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8487620","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3K1qQDoHB7262rJtCZwLNbYKiK7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
