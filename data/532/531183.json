Without a formal marriage contract, the Mosuo traditionally build relationships based on free love and sexual satisfaction (‘walking marriages'). But can the sexual liberty and power of the Mosuo women survive as modern Chinese society slowly encroaches their ancestral land?  The film explores the present reality for the Mosuo people as well as the dangers that threaten their inherited way of life.","popularity":0.2917,"poster_path":"/lwa4rLdiEm0kH67nK6qc7HmMVYb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fall of Womenland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2068635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xiaodan He","original_name":"Xiaodan He","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/51tpchYuUSFfZ8S9EboJSugZOp4.jpg","credit_id":"5b29c88e92514139200014e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lwa4rLdiEm0kH67nK6qc7HmMVYb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":738,"name":"sexuality"},{"id":10983,"name":"anthropology"},{"id":11921,"name":"sociology"},{"id":200690,"name":"matriarchy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SVT","release_date":"2013-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
