Knowing this, we decided to create a musical film where popular melodies of 30-40 years were played, such as \"Splash of Champagne\", \"Carioca\", \"Tiko-tiko\", \"Joseph\", \"No need to be sad\", etc. The film is structured as a conversation between a pop singer (Vera Beradze) and a collector of old records (Boris Shcherbakov). After the selected record is put on the gramophone and a familiar melody sounds, the old collector suddenly appears in the frame with the singer and transforms into a brave Mexican, then a playboy, or a guy from the outskirts of Moscow, depending on the song being played.","popularity":0.1091,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":104700,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Odeon Studio","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1994-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Records","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Shcherbakov","original_name":"Борис Щербаков","popularity":0.405,"profile_path":"/eFQC3x2WvWvJZ0eRohUdYMWMUP8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6098ee67b87aec003b9f6148","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anatoly Eyramdzhan","original_name":"Анатолий Эйрамджан","popularity":0.1371,"profile_path":"/6zuWBJ6GyAGHUWogWeQL08x7Laf.jpg","credit_id":"6098ee84a3d027003a415c38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anatoly Eyramdzhan","original_name":"Анатолий Эйрамджан","popularity":0.1371,"profile_path":"/6zuWBJ6GyAGHUWogWeQL08x7Laf.jpg","credit_id":"6098ee94d2b209003b78a578","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"12+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1994-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
