Before 1949, Wang graduated from Tongji University in Shanghai. He was a student with good morals, intelligence and health. He then served as an assistant professor in the Economics Department of Renmin University. However, he was labelled a “Rightist” in 1957 and was sent to a farm in Tianjin to undertake forced labour. There, he underwent extreme humiliating “reform” and suffered starvation. Later, on a bumpy road as he was being sent to be buried, he miraculously discovered that he was actually alive.","popularity":0.055,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Guy Who Arrived in Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hu Jie","original_name":"胡杰","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/4u1S6V6xXBK2c2LkmE0DQTMnWl9.jpg","credit_id":"6098cc39fd6300003d689576","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
