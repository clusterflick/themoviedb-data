In the documentary, director Jerzy Hoffman presents the magical world of a folk marketplace. As a result, groups of imposters, specialists in black magic, home-grown inventors and charismatic healers are gathered among the stalls. Wonder Fair is a colourful world full of figures of the Blessed Virgin Mary, gingerbread hearts and ointments for all ailments. The documentary, awarded at the 1967 Tourfilm Competition in Warsaw, gives up irony or big-city paternalism, presenting the characters with sympathy and warmth.","popularity":0.0585,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wytwórnia Filmów Dokumentalnych","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Miracle Fair","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerzy Hoffman","original_name":"Jerzy Hoffman","popularity":0.1376,"profile_path":"/29iNh2JlmeF1opRMiZiBlABJXiM.jpg","credit_id":"60980ed87ecd28003b13149b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerzy Hoffman","original_name":"Jerzy Hoffman","popularity":0.1376,"profile_path":"/29iNh2JlmeF1opRMiZiBlABJXiM.jpg","credit_id":"632415365437f5007a91084c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362141,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Halina Paszkowska","original_name":"Halina Paszkowska","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632415bd3d3557008422f3dd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090709,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ludmila Godziaszwili","original_name":"Ludmila Godziaszwili","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6324158d84591c007a2a3ec2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1687134,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wacław Florkowski","original_name":"Wacław Florkowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63241575db154f009860c524","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0171412","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
