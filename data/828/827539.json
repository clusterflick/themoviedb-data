Although the archives are opening up, almost fifty years after the signing of the Evian Agreements (March 18, 1962), direct witnesses are beginning to disappear. They are, however, unique bearers of history, often the only ones able to illustrate the harsh reality of a long-hidden period. Gérard Zwang, surgeon of the contingent between May 1956 and June 1958, is one of these essential witnesses who help us discover an original history of the Algerian War. During his service, in charge of treating the most atrocious wounds of his fellow soldiers, he sees the war from the side of its victims. He did not fight with a machine pistol in his hand, but behind the closed doors of an operating room where life gives way to death in a matter of seconds.","popularity":0.284,"poster_path":"/2HduU6vh8jgL379uFUgw0yzLvcq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24678,"logo_path":"/2XgHpNJsBm6jh4CVrgqpLQemXmU.png","name":"CC&C","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":32645,"logo_path":"/voB1FAfKtxxhFbVT93hVJcNO28z.png","name":"Planète+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surgeon during the Algerian War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Costelle","original_name":"Daniel Costelle","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/aTcWpu8uetTBosLZdzYdUz4781g.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"60974e7d9bcd0f003b7778a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4096695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérard Zwang","original_name":"Gérard Zwang","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/dS5DUcPRhRYYDrHIChhxi40wv6e.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"647c945217497300c132e637","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130159,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Léon Rousseau","original_name":"Léon Rousseau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/drI7CKUMwKbduKbz1dLRBU0EGww.jpg","credit_id":"60974e9bdd2589003ced6d9d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabelle Clarke","original_name":"Isabelle Clarke","popularity":0.271,"profile_path":"/rl5BEBpv6RilKlWnGdYM2MzK0ao.jpg","credit_id":"60974ea854508d003c0d6467","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2415505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mickaël Gamrasni","original_name":"Mickaël Gamrasni","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60974ef59661fc003c992b82","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabelle Clarke","original_name":"Isabelle Clarke","popularity":0.271,"profile_path":"/rl5BEBpv6RilKlWnGdYM2MzK0ao.jpg","credit_id":"60974eb510dad6003d1082d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kévin Accart","original_name":"Kévin Accart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60974eea1130bd003e8d8eb5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Costelle","original_name":"Daniel Costelle","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/aTcWpu8uetTBosLZdzYdUz4781g.jpg","credit_id":"60974eca9661fc003d9a6244","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2193051","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":762,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/pQPikySoNemXu0ThHGSKg9tdHYg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":509},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2HduU6vh8jgL379uFUgw0yzLvcq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2263,"name":"algerian"},{"id":213473,"name":"algerian war (1954-62)"},{"id":280002,"name":"war surgeon"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Planète+","release_date":"2012-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
