Marder). Ceramic sculptures were gardened for a year letting plant life grow on them as their skin. Four super-8 cameras were made into a mobile, thereby also filming the process and its shared motion. To embrace the filmed material as a fictional construction, it was optically printed and altered; to accompany the notion of the sculptures as possible chests, containers of heart, vocal sounds were recorded with Camila de Laborde and weaved into the film.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/gsSayCl9TtPg0g3Vi5p7bnkwqHm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2021-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fictions conjures representations as if it is imagined from the perspective of the plant world.","title":"Fictions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490733,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Manuela de Laborde","original_name":"Manuela de Laborde","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60988006b0040a003ed3bc6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15440046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gsSayCl9TtPg0g3Vi5p7bnkwqHm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
