Filmed during the winter of 1964-1965 by the young director Ennio Lorenzini, it is the first international Algerian production which paints a rare portrait in color of a multifaceted nation, far from the simplistic vision created by the press and the French army. Produced by Casbah Film, Les Mains Libres (initially titled Tronc De Figuier) bears witness to the stigmata of colonization and the future of free Algeria throughout the Algerian territory and reveals the richness of its landscapes and the diversity of its traditions . The documentary, using the aesthetics of militant cinema of the time, is made up of four scenes: Sea and Desert, The Struggle, The Earth, Freedom.","popularity":0.327,"poster_path":"/cmz5Sv63zAJDtIUizhlZ8HWTCk1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10207,"logo_path":"/wWGJsB8qAy9gqD1zCZL5J2pcYvu.png","name":"Casbah Film","origin_country":"DZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"1965-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Mains Libres","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5107215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Si Mohamed Baghdadi","original_name":"Si Mohamed Baghdadi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/rjInfnTbj5FaXzFvA1JaorAmpHm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6756150ca7b2fcb11e527278","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ennio Lorenzini","original_name":"Ennio Lorenzini","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/nwp1D5fbJ2CephfTxc6QxLrPx9I.jpg","credit_id":"60974c8ea055ef0040be35bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yacef Saâdi","original_name":"Saadi Yacef","popularity":0.1591,"profile_path":"/7zRZq2sS1XFQa4JgKZVtauWKAv3.jpg","credit_id":"6755fc7b431108aa23d113ee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed Zinet","original_name":"Mohamed Zinet","popularity":0.1767,"profile_path":"/1zbSOuOYT9lBPlN2ZNihEtgU9wV.jpg","credit_id":"6755fc87431108aa23d113f9","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15132,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mario Serandrei","original_name":"Mario Serandrei","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6755fcd7431108aa23d11418","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557153,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Claudio Racca","original_name":"Claudio Racca","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6756333f6f37f6e89adc6b80","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450788,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Belkacem Bazi","original_name":"Belkacem Bazi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67563408eafc4a14955b87b1","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443344,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sidi Boumedienne Dahmane","original_name":"Sidi Boumedienne Dahmane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67563543f31dc8ce88fd8b5d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0856239","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u99vQyIe5zYV2esFauFEbzuTN8A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h0KRuVFRxJnkDPwRg6wLs5YIdJp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eHuig0YJijaQNLk5p3UZhvdIK2e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2xogocZzVLX8BUYIBlM93YbMgue.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yzcQ5CxzPNuqdKmjhjDVKTXOGMp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cmz5Sv63zAJDtIUizhlZ8HWTCk1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":187196,"name":"french colonialism"},{"id":213473,"name":"algerian war (1954-62)"},{"id":262858,"name":"anti-colonialism"},{"id":293245,"name":"maghreb"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":293620,"name":"independance war"},{"id":296484,"name":"algerian cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
