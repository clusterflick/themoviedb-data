Now, working as a server at a fancy tourist hotel, she is raising her two sons alone, back where she started. Filmed against magnificent backdrops and stunning vistas, Dropstones captures a year in the life of a family pulling together to weather snowstorms, first jobs and family barbecues. As the matriarch of the family, Sonya's mission to raise Luke and Sean as \"two good men\" proves difficult at times, especially when balancing the demands of a seasonal job with single parenting. Despite the many high-pitched arguments, Sonya takes the time to show affection and love to her boys, always ready to listen to Sean's recommended technology upgrades and Luke's school woes. A coming-of-age story that takes the time to connect to place, identity and tradition.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6kj17N1wOfUpRbLQsdQmgTQDlUH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dropstones","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1784128,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caitlin Durlak","original_name":"Caitlin Durlak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60984caaaf58cb003cb19513","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1784128,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caitlin Durlak","original_name":"Caitlin Durlak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6197f11abc2cb300427a2bd7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3316622,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Durlak","original_name":"Alex Durlak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6197f14f798e060062ac9f7a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1784128,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caitlin Durlak","original_name":"Caitlin Durlak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6197f12963536a002a7b2506","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6kj17N1wOfUpRbLQsdQmgTQDlUH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":944}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hot Docs 2021 Trailers: DROPSTONES","key":"Ktj2G4ZvddA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-14T14:03:50.000Z","id":"6197f1bb1e259a004384be77"}]}}}
