Across North America, newspapers are dying, but in Lakefield, Terry McQuitty, the town paperâ€™s publisher, carries on a rich, 150-year-old tradition. Set to the pace of small-town life, Unheralded is a testament to the vital role newspapers can still play, and the close bond between reporter and reader.","popularity":0.0774,"poster_path":"/9J0t6gxPHEMd6VtFR5GkMtzYOkY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unheralded","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779509,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Grant Edmonds","original_name":"Grant Edmonds","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce05a59251415a41016d7a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779507,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Allie Caldwell","original_name":"Allie Caldwell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce05d9c3a36850fb016335","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Hancox","original_name":"Aaron Hancox","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce05ee9251415a8b016e03","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779510,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Rose","original_name":"Nick Rose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce05c9c3a36850c0014271","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Hancox","original_name":"Aaron Hancox","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce0560c3a36850fb0162a2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Hancox","original_name":"Aaron Hancox","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce053bc3a368510e0161e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779507,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Allie Caldwell","original_name":"Allie Caldwell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce05539251415a45016d6d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779507,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Allie Caldwell","original_name":"Allie Caldwell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce056dc3a368510401604f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261493,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Silva Basmajian","original_name":"Silva Basmajian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce05ba9251415a7d0173af","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105043,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lea Marin","original_name":"Lea Marin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce05e0c3a36850c001428d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779508,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lawrence Jackman","original_name":"Lawrence Jackman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce0587c3a36850c0014233","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2660472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zZK2ezsN02X49Bbwwj9CUHezGmF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":796,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9J0t6gxPHEMd6VtFR5GkMtzYOkY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
