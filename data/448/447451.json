Koszulinski investigates a region defined by imaginary histories and landscapes, from the drained and dredged river known as The Everglades to the man-made white sand beaches that make up Florida's coastline. Early visions of Florida landscapes are revealed, from the early 20th-century Koreshan utopian community, founded by Cyrus Teed in the swamplands of Florida, to the world's largest planned subdivision--Golden Gate Estates--which projected a population of over 400,000 residents. Five-hundred years after Ponce de Leon's discovery of Florida, Koszulinski reflects on the many ways in which Florida's landscapes have been irreversibly shaped by human desires.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Stop, Flamingo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1483430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georg Koszulinski","original_name":"Georg Koszulinski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58cc25579251415e2f01646c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3071522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
