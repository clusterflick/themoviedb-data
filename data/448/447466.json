Eric Owens is Jaufré Rudel, a troubadour in 12th century France who has become tired of his hedonistic life and longs for an idealized love. Enter the Pilgrim (Tamara Mumford) who tells him his perfect love does, in fact, exist, far across the sea. She is Clémence, Countess of Tripoli (Susanna Phillips). The magic of the characters’ inner lives as they explore the meaning of love, longing, life, and death is heightened by Saariaho’s hypnotic and bewitching score, conducted by Susanna Mälkki.","popularity":0.6421,"poster_path":"/3RGyOu77m4G5a3v27nV89vacFfa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: L’Amour de Loin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Met Opera Live: L'amour de Loin","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanna Phillips","original_name":"Susanna Phillips","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/kOzAsB7AplYc4tbEVLqYtkeOqJ5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Clémence","credit_id":"58cc416d925141744f000ca7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1183532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Mumford","original_name":"Tamara Mumford","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/aUHYvL0yoPmOSzcX3JHF93P3m1B.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Pilgrim","credit_id":"58cc4175c3a3685190000d54","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1549003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Owens","original_name":"Eric Owens","popularity":0.112,"profile_path":"/mi0vGNuhdBL02I0RKjlBxiXHE2g.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jaufré Rudel","credit_id":"58cc41809251417426000df1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":266422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Voigt","original_name":"Deborah Voigt","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":"/oofK3iDXS6FDclhHK8mDWwTWFC5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"5eb35a7eccb15f002283e0a6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MET Orchestra","original_name":"MET Orchestra","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6003b68c420228003fef19ed","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1778516,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Susanna Mälkki","original_name":"Susanna Mälkki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58cc4161925141744f000c9c","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38527,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lepage","original_name":"Robert Lepage","popularity":0.2823,"profile_path":"/cgPCsNrKLuRVQ0IwuIHmdje1N7H.jpg","credit_id":"58cc412e9251417447000dab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1778513,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kaija Saariaho","original_name":"Kaija Saariaho","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/cSwq8KIQOdTRucF3m0QFAkd56NQ.jpg","credit_id":"5eb35770cc277c001f656341","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2195218,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amin Maalouf","original_name":"Amin Maalouf","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/mGWncXHompAbV8T5lcWcNFkSnAW.jpg","credit_id":"5eb4743c0cb3350020c96feb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Halvorson","original_name":"Gary Halvorson","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/9KwJweL5GN0y5rvsvBhBRlVtmb0.jpg","credit_id":"5eb47408c3514c001e558ffe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6505058","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zNRcRcJOvCNNS8MnUvxb77dQfmh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1151,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xbwNFNCP5gpZEFeKHDqvduJVQyt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3RGyOu77m4G5a3v27nV89vacFfa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":764},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/Alg1uxTpBKlVMpHSGFITVaxkUGc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":222119,"name":"opera live performance"},{"id":238456,"name":"the metropolitan opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Met: Live in HD 2016-2017 - L'Amour de Loin trailer","key":"alKk-7z0h7A","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-02-10T03:39:29.000Z","id":"5eb3570966469a001de1861d"}]}}}
