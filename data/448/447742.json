But thanks to playboy Lumpkin, he's mistaken by his prospective son-in-law Marlow for an innkeeper, his daughter for the local barmaid. The good news is, while Marlow can barely speak to a woman of quality he's a charmer with those of a different stamp. And so, as Hardcastle's indignation intensifies, Miss Hardcastle's appreciation for her misguided suitor soars. Misdemeanours multiply, love blossoms, mayhem ensues. One of the great, generous-hearted and ingenious comedies of the English language, Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer offers a celebration of chaos, courtship and the dysfunctional family.","popularity":1.1466,"poster_path":"/m2e7uOqw39Dwn7Q5ItivtJIMbWy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16355,"logo_path":"/tWuPpLrD2urqKPXIit4VLTHWvgK.png","name":"National Theatre","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-03-29","revenue":84448,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Theatre Live: She Stoops to Conquer","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"She Stoops to Conquer","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":204807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Fynn","original_name":"David Fynn","popularity":0.5338,"profile_path":"/6knJVGZnTMM11fVQFKjWdel9xhG.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Tony Lumpkin","credit_id":"58ce0ac8c3a36850e90161db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Hadden-Paton","original_name":"Harry Hadden-Paton","popularity":0.3959,"profile_path":"/qyP94KSd95vGScVwIpENI3aWTYb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Young Marlow","credit_id":"58ce0ad5c3a368508c016e66","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1417351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cush Jumbo","original_name":"Cush Jumbo","popularity":0.8903,"profile_path":"/yM3hmPlsSdAFcSUZkeiqs9M9qBf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Miss Neville","credit_id":"58ce0aecc3a368510e0168c4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":543632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Kelly","original_name":"Katherine Kelly","popularity":0.6179,"profile_path":"/gh8uNkRvuC6cHpnXKtaT2iKg0Ht.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Miss Hardcastle","credit_id":"58ce0afdc3a36850c0014810","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Pemberton","original_name":"Steve Pemberton","popularity":0.9025,"profile_path":"/j4AFPsF6DM9nfccol3VFQgPJ6Ia.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hardcastle","credit_id":"58ce0b0e9251415a8b017440","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1647688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Rainey","original_name":"Zoe Rainey","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/opYLLpi9ZBMQ2m4bsZmz1PolExe.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Phyllis","credit_id":"58ce0b199251415a6101825c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Thompson","original_name":"Sophie Thompson","popularity":0.766,"profile_path":"/tRPHovRBLwZTeWodLBqUD2arrlH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Hardcastle","credit_id":"58ce0b46c3a368510e016941","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Jackson","original_name":"Oliver Jackson","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":"/4inUELF72RQhPwTCCGkaJE8yja1.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Diggory / Ensemble","credit_id":"61bf8e4c873f00001b23a2da","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1779553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie Lloyd","original_name":"Jamie Lloyd","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce0bc7c3a36851040167cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779556,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oliver Goldsmith","original_name":"Oliver Goldsmith","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ce0bd39251415a7d017b68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2108180","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m2e7uOqw39Dwn7Q5ItivtJIMbWy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":674}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":246884,"name":"filmed theater"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official She Stoops to Conquer Trailer | National Theatre Collection","key":"pUrcaEq2jko","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2020-06-01T17:59:59.000Z","id":"64617fa46e0d7200ff4bd08d"}]}}}
