Exactly twelve years ago, when he was six, his father filmed him while he was visiting a park in Warsaw. Tomek used to stop next to some old people sitting on the benches, and, with childish frankness, would ask them questions about joy, loneliness, fear of death, dreams, love and lack of love. Now, after twelve years, on his birthday, Tomek comes back to the garden of his childhood. A magical encounter will commence.","popularity":0.0965,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If It Happens","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Łoziński","original_name":"Marcel Łoziński","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c988c5c3a3682350000bb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Łoziński","original_name":"Marcel Łoziński","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c988be9251415e85000b64","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362141,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Halina Paszkowska","original_name":"Halina Paszkowska","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c989699251415e8d000c1f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777054,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ino Kümek","original_name":"Ino Kümek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c989529251415e72000bf2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1408555,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katarzyna Maciejko-Kowalczyk","original_name":"Katarzyna Maciejko-Kowalczyk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c989439251415e76000bbc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1068350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacek Bławut","original_name":"Jacek Bławut","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/vgY51KdOASBi0qO3JCN3xmDbC7F.jpg","credit_id":"59017783c3a36810d7005c2c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6427,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Artur Reinhart","original_name":"Artur Reinhart","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/83VRsGj428u5IwH0eD8I9Mfvq1c.jpg","credit_id":"59017789c3a36810c6006524","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14603690","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
