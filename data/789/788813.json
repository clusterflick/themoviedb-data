In his 7,000-mile adventure, Sayle discovers mounties, moose, and a colorful assortment of railroad men and women. He also shares glimpses of a lesser-known Canada - Fishermen of the Maritime provinces, Indian settlements on the edge of the Arctic Ocean, polar bears frolicking, cowboys in the prairies - all loosely linked by the now resurgent transcontinental railway. Take the LAST TRAIN ACROSS CANADA for an unforgettable rail adventure, one filled with romance and extraordinary beauty.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Train Across Canada","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
