But nature and tourism do not always go hand in hand. The rich investor W. Horst from North Rhine-Westphalia is building more and more hotels and accommodation, the planning of which is approved by four men on the municipal council without any problems. The motto is growth.

They see an upcoming local election, in which they must win a majority, as their only chance to oppose this.","popularity":0.1323,"poster_path":"/xzsffsOp8A83nlwo5UwnkQlonn8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35210,"logo_path":"/41NPHKSaV2kFGRfmgzm97wWQEHF.png","name":"Ostlicht Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Owns My Village?","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfried Horst","original_name":"Wilfried Horst","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Investor","credit_id":"6737c361ad278a8963f82d75","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Förster","original_name":"Nadine Förster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bewohnerin","credit_id":"6737c46d9c16dafa06f99107","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernd Elgeti","original_name":"Bernd Elgeti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bewohner","credit_id":"6737c484443543191ccbab2d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Pigard","original_name":"Markus Pigard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bewohner","credit_id":"6737c49835f1e6d17d2e8724","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Möller","original_name":"Klaus Möller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Bewohner","credit_id":"6737c4cd281ac972ea44854f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans-Haral Ott","original_name":"Hans-Haral Ott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Bewohner","credit_id":"6737c4dd443543191ccbab51","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin Kopplin","original_name":"Edwin Kopplin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Bewohner","credit_id":"6737c4ef281ac972ea448562","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Pester","original_name":"Wolfgang Pester","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Bewohner","credit_id":"6737c5039c16dafa06f99152","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2072496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Eder","original_name":"Christoph Eder","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60088860de11e5003e32a066","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2072496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Eder","original_name":"Christoph Eder","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60088868ce6c4c003e4fdcb5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2224010,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Domenik Schuster","original_name":"Domenik Schuster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600888743f8ede00405e9d6a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358608,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Patrick Richter","original_name":"Patrick Richter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6008887fe04d8a0040c18dc1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13882316","wikidata_id":"Q106870253","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aeWIZ44ET1tRSszyIPepsvfpJ5i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/xzsffsOp8A83nlwo5UwnkQlonn8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/wcfUhgF2TpiCtQpJOjD1qdoSfs9.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1810},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":928,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/9nfdC4P9Cr3fgnmeVtrj1KcDjeF.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":654}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmfestival Max Ophüls Preis","release_date":"2021-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
