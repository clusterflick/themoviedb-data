The video contains footage of The Gatekeeper, a man who often interrupts the game to occasionally punish or reward the players at random. For example, if a player fails to answer him with \"Yes, my Gatekeeper\", he may banish them to the Black Hole. At the end of the game, if no player has won, the Gatekeeper appears and ends the game, declaring himself the winner.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/A3QNSccMdtrjopPPP7iswVDshyO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"TURN THE VOLUME UP AND THE LIGHTS DOWN","title":"Nightmare: The Video Board-game","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Atmosfear","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Atmosfear","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Atmosfear","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1775367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wenanty Nosul","original_name":"Wenanty Nosul","popularity":0.2098,"profile_path":"/suL2HEh3COP78zqRCazilKTAwDR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Gatekeeper","credit_id":"6009d485d70594003b1b623f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1244390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillip Tanner","original_name":"Phillip Tanner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206595fcb802800685f64a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1244390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillip Tanner","original_name":"Phillip Tanner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206596793388b00df0d5a15","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1244390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillip Tanner","original_name":"Phillip Tanner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206596f29733800f7abd6fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3421880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brett Clements","original_name":"Brett Clements","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206597fce5d8200c8341e7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3421880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brett Clements","original_name":"Brett Clements","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620659859408ec008ce1bc03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3421880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brett Clements","original_name":"Brett Clements","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206598b93388b001b284551","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n1sK6lGiwTOYNYlqym9tDxfFofo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/A3QNSccMdtrjopPPP7iswVDshyO.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8NpkyYQ7Foqm7wYlvEv5LLGdkGQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
