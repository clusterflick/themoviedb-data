The dramatic material is intertwined with life and the emotional scenes of the musical; it creates a distinctive choreography, which is a statement of the deaf people’s craving to love this world and to be open. Reciting to music, which is the way of singing of the deaf, is the strongest and most unexpected witness of the realities of their world.","popularity":0.0885,"poster_path":"/r0mqUWbLmYgFDSt3EZAEanZyEjE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63320,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kaupo Filma","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2004-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romeo and Juliet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viesturs Kairišs","original_name":"Viesturs Kairišs","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":"/eN7MeihOABSaOw4UuL0OPwvnjOW.jpg","credit_id":"600a3086391b9c0041d2b7a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viesturs Kairišs","original_name":"Viesturs Kairišs","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":"/eN7MeihOABSaOw4UuL0OPwvnjOW.jpg","credit_id":"600a3091dd83fa003d8eb5b4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297706,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gints Bērziņš","original_name":"Gints Bērziņš","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600a30a54d0e8d003d6f9b7d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189303,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ieva Jurjāne","original_name":"Ieva Jurjāne","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600a30b923d278004035f7d1","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297711,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","original_name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600a30cde04d8a003dc4aafa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Hundsbichler","original_name":"Klaus Hundsbichler","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600a30df2495ab003f09e448","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599480,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Normunds Kļaviņš","original_name":"Normunds Kļaviņš","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600a30f2cf9ba3003f838459","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1733549,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guntis Trekteris","original_name":"Guntis Trekteris","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600a3104cf9ba3004183c744","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1013696","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":780,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r0mqUWbLmYgFDSt3EZAEanZyEjE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
