By the pool, in the hammock and even round the campfire they are buried in their books. Or they discuss literature. This changes when they come across a sleeping Ghanaian in the garden. The rather mousy Mira takes care of his ill mother and, soon, of other stranded boat people. The haven of peace changes into an aid station, not to everyone's pleasure. Harmless collisions - does the Ghanaian have to read Michel Houellebecq to gain a better understanding of Europe? - get out of hand more and more, until the idyll crumbles.","popularity":0.1196,"poster_path":"/mLjlANd6LDBvraC6wK1JrbXiyrE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2006-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maybe Sweden","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2945017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marleen Scholten","original_name":"Marleen Scholten","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60089f62ce6c4c003f50b734","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2945018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theophilus Felix Mensah","original_name":"Theophilus Felix Mensah","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60089f6ce04d8a003fc1ab71","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matijs Jansen","original_name":"Matijs Jansen","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":"/iCAoAqXtUcpOWcvm9MJFVhgXHzD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60089f7e676ce200495e4779","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2945020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nana Obusu","original_name":"Nana Obusu","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60089f86cb8028003ffb2b63","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2945021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Asiedu","original_name":"Elizabeth Asiedu","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60089f8ece6c4c003e4ff56f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1077769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maartje Remmers","original_name":"Maartje Remmers","popularity":0.1312,"profile_path":"/zn9JkotQ9I2Lv21DBdcsOaUvBIC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"60089f960752880040751124","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wine Dierickx","original_name":"Wine Dierickx","popularity":0.1553,"profile_path":"/dKKvvKRMlpfc4aWdC0SNTjHHVOK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60089fa0176a9400500b6b87","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2945024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Bart","original_name":"Walter Bart","popularity":0.193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"60089fad7d5504003ebbfcfd","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1007643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margien Rogaar","original_name":"Margien Rogaar","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60089f2f3a993700484e161b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0847502","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mLjlANd6LDBvraC6wK1JrbXiyrE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
