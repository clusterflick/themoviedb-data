Since Peachem has a hefty mortgage on the inn, he thinks he can use it to effect a union, but the girl is not interested in him. She already has a sweetheart, handsome Randolph Roanoke (Owen Moore). Peachem and his dumb-as-dirt assistant, Blaa Blaa (Sennett), try to keep Roanoke and Mabel apart. Their feeble attempts are in vain, and Mabel easily manages to outwit them and win the man she loves. - Janiss Garza","popularity":0.351,"poster_path":"/pCN1UR4QNRYKC72bNhD8sqqaKGY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh, Mabel Behave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Normand","original_name":"Mabel Normand","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/7aSeqYhxHaqd0wCHE9yaXu9XWOV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Innkeeper's Daughter","credit_id":"60081c82676ce2004b5dc0dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Owen Moore","original_name":"Owen Moore","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/6iBzyALpUaf22lKD2kRgzmsHGuC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Randolph Roanoke","credit_id":"60081c92676ce200515dd863","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Blaa Blaa","credit_id":"60081ca04d0e8d003f6d98e8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ford Sterling","original_name":"Ford Sterling","popularity":0.2488,"profile_path":"/jWwCuNR2eRpgxlRBKNTCTmCVHP0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Squire Peachem","credit_id":"60081cb54d0e8d003e6d6ab4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Davenport","original_name":"Alice Davenport","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/wDTYw5DAcHcgueWfbIFTuQLU6ph.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Innkeeper's Wife","credit_id":"60081cca4d0e8d003c6d45a7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1263416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fontaine La Rue","original_name":"Fontaine La Rue","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/gUlDAnnczXncfSFtOTHGu9wLtBO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Barmaid","credit_id":"60081cdf2d531a00585f9a23","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","credit_id":"60081cface6c4c00414f9b61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ford Sterling","original_name":"Ford Sterling","popularity":0.2488,"profile_path":"/jWwCuNR2eRpgxlRBKNTCTmCVHP0.jpg","credit_id":"60081d08cb80280041f9feca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0013448","wikidata_id":"Q7080373","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pCN1UR4QNRYKC72bNhD8sqqaKGY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":236121,"name":"colonial america"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1922-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
