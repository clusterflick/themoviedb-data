It was a few of our friends, in the last days of summer, trying to figure out how to remember. Sometimes we made them in secret. Sometimes we spent days on them. But a plaque could be a hastily-done afterthought, and it would still become a symbol to future generations of what friendship could really be, what it could mean in our lives. Some of us made several plaques - some of us never put our name on any. But anyone who's spent time in the Tzofim Bet Am knows that a unique, mysterious history lives on its walls, and what a summer once felt like, way back then. Because everyone loves a good story.","popularity":0.2448,"poster_path":"/oxlj9KIkVl2P3bPnPNuYjpCOcv9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It was a few of our friends, in the last days of summer, trying to figure out how to remember.","title":"I Was Here: Eisner's Story from the Inside Out","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2946533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Freelander","original_name":"Adam Freelander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600a1230cb8028003efc95f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2946534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evyatar Gour","original_name":"Evyatar Gour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600a12647d5504003dbdf6ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1989,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oxlj9KIkVl2P3bPnPNuYjpCOcv9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1326}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11704,"name":"judaism"},{"id":275791,"name":"eisner camp"},{"id":275792,"name":"urj"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
