A road movie discovering the working world of tomorrow. This documentary will take you on a journey through the post-industrial knowledge and services workshops, our supposed future working place. In this new world work will be handled more liberally. Time clocks cease to exist. Attention is not compulsory any more. The resource “human“ comes into focus. The film closely follows the high-tech work force – people who are highly mobile and passionate to make their work their purpose in life. Further episodes resume this topic and lead into the world of modern office architecture and into the world of Human Resource Management.","popularity":0.5063,"poster_path":"/bKKCZExCYzLhQtmcmzTI1TWwJi0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":36590,"logo_path":null,"name":"HUPE Film- & Fernsehproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Work Hard Play Hard","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48542,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carmen Losmann","original_name":"Carmen Losmann","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49969251416c750ccd0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006849,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erik Winker","original_name":"Erik Winker","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49969251416c750ccd11","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752897,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dirk Lütter","original_name":"Dirk Lütter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a79581c0e0a2659850216cf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1711009,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Henk Drees","original_name":"Henk Drees","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7958350e0a2659880212aa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48542,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carmen Losmann","original_name":"Carmen Losmann","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a79582ac3a368227302081a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2084148","wikidata_id":"Q2593423","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1683,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/anjpNsGH2K8o7BaTvRcZrTJc2FB.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/bKKCZExCYzLhQtmcmzTI1TWwJi0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2346,"name":"worker"},{"id":554,"name":"manager"},{"id":1438,"name":"office"},{"id":3131,"name":"modern society"},{"id":8162,"name":"industrial society "},{"id":11943,"name":"mobile"},{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"},{"id":156076,"name":"human relationship"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
