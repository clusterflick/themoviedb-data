The second story, \"King of the Vampires,\" deals with a slight-figured killer called the King of the Vampires by Scotland Yard. The third, \"Monster Raid,\" is about a man turned zombie when he ODs on his experimental drug. \"Spark of Life\" deals with a doctor Mendell obsessed with the experiments of a thrown-out professor named Erich von Frankenstein. \"Count Alucard\" is a variation on the Dracula story, with the Count acquiring the deed to Carfax Abbey from Harker as vampiresses and dead bodies start turning up.","popularity":0.8085,"poster_path":"/z6Xy1rJQ1FYfu7NsGCwp5zsMDyR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15937,"logo_path":null,"name":"American General Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":132810,"logo_path":null,"name":"Borealis Enterprises Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":132811,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dorad Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"So shocking it will sliver your liver!","title":"Gallery of Horror","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":28,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Gallery of Horrors","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Return from the Past","type":"TV title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dr. Terror's Gallery of Horror","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Witch's Clock","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"La galleria degli orrori","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dr. Terror's Gallery of Horrors","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lon Chaney Jr.","original_name":"Lon Chaney Jr.","popularity":0.7445,"profile_path":"/xj8gBZ7Vbu1rGm1uaL11MfD8RSe.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Mendell","credit_id":"52fe49769251416c750c8d6b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Carradine","original_name":"John Carradine","popularity":0.8306,"profile_path":"/hv2AAXNlTHVmGgXn8q7025S0g2b.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator / Tristram Halbin","credit_id":"52fe49769251416c750c8d6f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rochelle Hudson","original_name":"Rochelle Hudson","popularity":0.2932,"profile_path":"/2Mi0CBL9pvzLnCBTnfekH0JizcM.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Helen Spalding","credit_id":"52fe49769251416c750c8d73","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Gentry","original_name":"Roger Gentry","popularity":0.1238,"profile_path":"/A6ax0qp4qJ4nmuAbh3pRja3Xzay.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bob Farrell / Mob Leader / Dr. Sevard / Jonathan Harker","credit_id":"52fe49769251416c750c8d77","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Doyle","original_name":"Ron Doyle","popularity":0.0775,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Brenner / Dr. Charles Spalding / Dr. Cushing","credit_id":"52fe49769251416c750c8d7b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Joy","original_name":"Karen Joy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Julie Farrell / Medina, the Vampire","credit_id":"52fe49769251416c750c8d7f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vic McGee","original_name":"Vic McGee","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/7HWIrKfd1gtXsqAYDUUiU7GX7Vo.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Dr. Finchley / Desmond / Amos Duncan / The Burgermeister","credit_id":"52fe49769251416c750c8d83","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Brogan","original_name":"Ron Brogan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Marsh","credit_id":"52fe49769251416c750c8d87","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2614741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Moore","original_name":"Margaret Moore","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Mrs. O'Shea","credit_id":"5ea4a779af4324001da0e2a5","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":100160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gray Daniels","original_name":"Gray Daniels","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"The Coachman","credit_id":"5ea4a786ec455200213fb866","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2614743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitch Evans","original_name":"Mitch Evans","popularity":0.106,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Count Alucard","credit_id":"5ea4a7a73faba0001e466c9d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":102959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Benson","original_name":"Joey Benson","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"Dr. Sedgewick","credit_id":"5ea4a7b518b751001f380a20","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David L.
