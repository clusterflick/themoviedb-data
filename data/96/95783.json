He goes to Merlin to seek his counsel, and Merlin begins a story of his own, about a young boy with strange abilities and visions. The boy, called Emrys, is feared in his village called of as a demon. Eventually, King Vortigern comes and forces his village to build a tower for him. However, the tower crumbles. His wizards advise him to find a demon boy and spill his blood upon the ground. However, when the boy is brought before Vortigern, he predicts that there is a pool of water beneath the foundations of the castle that weaken it. The workers find a pool of water and two strange stones, from which two beasts emerge, a white and a red dragon.","popularity":0.6449,"poster_path":"/yQqaiTC4G85JQ9SkIXdeeCuZBr2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6223,"logo_path":"/lOxuAoSiKVeePamkUq5VCyUFiPw.png","name":"Shanghai Animation Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":46328,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lightyear Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merlin and the Dragons","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Merl√≠n y los dragones","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Kline","original_name":"Kevin Kline","popularity":1.4282,"profile_path":"/ArH5dACd9AmWNNMnI6bGEkiFYIM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe49959251416c750ccb2d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":571917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dennis Woodyard","original_name":"Dennis Woodyard","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49949251416c750ccb23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1006803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hu Yihong","original_name":"Hu Yihong","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49959251416c750ccb29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Alan Lee","original_name":"Alan Lee","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":"/jwIR5GIRLCIZLTNqLofMYPimXeO.jpg","credit_id":"67f53f38ddf9194387d9fa29","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6880,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Robert Gould","original_name":"Robert Gould","popularity":0.168,"profile_path":"/m08LDuOUJFppXiHZMxFVaLQgjh6.jpg","credit_id":"67f53f59ddf9194387d9fa36","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425697,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arne Holland","original_name":"Arne Holland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f53fcfeddec28b03addb30","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5357798,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joshua M.
