Jerem's dream has always been to be a great soldier for a king. His family tells him a man named Jesus is the real King. But when he sees Jesus enter Jerusalem on a donkey, he thinks he has been tricked.  Disheartened, he runs off and meets with two Pharisees who promise to enlist him as a soldier to tell people that Jesus is a hoax. In a hard lesson about appearances and judging, Jerem learns that Jesus is a true King. But, is he too late? Has he helped the Pharisees condemn Jesus to death? Originally created by the Christian Broadcasting Network as a fully animated video, this exciting new Easter book features artwork from the video and re-telling of the same story.","popularity":0.53,"poster_path":"/oJh8RINZ6UnPLKAck8PUNEZMmHT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
