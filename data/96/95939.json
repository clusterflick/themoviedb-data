Dave Shipper (John Weisbarth) is all set to enjoy a quiet summer, but the arrival of his cousin Jon (Frank Jimison) throws a wrench in his plans. Rather by chance, they happen upon an old map that sets them on a quest, along with Dave's friend Freddy (Freddy Rible), to seek out a legendary treasure said to be buried deep inside the ocean cliffs. With the help of an old local fisherman (\"Smokey\" Tom Hodgins), the boys compile clues that unravel a 30-year-old murder mystery and lead them closer to their prize. They quickly draw the attention of a bumbling crew of malicious treasure-hunters and a mysterious pickaxe-wielding \"digger\", all intent on capturing the gold for themselves.","popularity":0.2466,"poster_path":"/9Nw1fhLUdkxVNtskgoyPGRivaTV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Relentless Race For A Mysterious Fortune","title":"The Treasure","video":false,"vote_average":3.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Skarb","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Skarb: The Treasure","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Treasure","type":"VHS"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1310162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Weisbarth","original_name":"John Weisbarth","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"534ce2dfc3a36860a3000903","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freddy Rible","original_name":"Freddy Rible","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"534ce2eac3a36860960008c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Jimison","original_name":"Frank Jimison","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"534ce2f6c3a36860960008cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Hodgins","original_name":"Tom Hodgins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"534ce306c3a36860830008ec","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310161,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James King","original_name":"James King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534ce212c3a36860750008e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":158054,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Cohen","original_name":"David Cohen","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534ce27ac3a368607c000853","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310160,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Cording","original_name":"Robert Cording","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534ce25cc3a36860880008fc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310160,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Cording","original_name":"Robert Cording","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534ce1d4c3a368607c00083d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4952060,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ralph Linhardt","original_name":"Ralph Linhardt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec877095ef84e3ec32634a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0100812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qZuTes36yc8EPhgMoNuX02XM0bB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/16ETrdZL9zSo6OGHUhUA4v25mKQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/13tiob6PMoMiQB3JRYgFaQbqok1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/76MlqbkcWoSL3MA5h523skQWT7K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9Nw1fhLUdkxVNtskgoyPGRivaTV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aXX9UCmAJz11Xh6e1JxOvcX4t6g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/orFG8bBFd5NojaZnunkUBMUJtLq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":682}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6956,"name":"treasure hunt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
