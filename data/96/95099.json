A fourteen-year-old student, Dannie, feels the real cause is linked to her recurring dreams. When the infection reaches an epidemic level. it becomes clear that this infection not only kills, but restores the body to a minimally functioning state where the infected become the \"living-dead\". This unique twist on the classic zombie theme, centers around the highly-intuitive Dannie Jacobs and a group of four other middle school students who try to save their friends, their town and themselves in spite of the odds against them. While they are desperately trying to find an answer before it's too late, they meet researcher Sue who may hold the key to the infection and Dannie's dreams.","popularity":0.3308,"poster_path":"/9kNtUsugwY8G3U9tB2cXce57lRX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Do you know what happens when you drink the water?","title":"Pathogen","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1137449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Kent-McGlew","original_name":"Rose Kent-McGlew","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dannie","credit_id":"52fe49779251416c750c8dff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1137450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alec Herskowitz","original_name":"Alec Herskowitz","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"52fe49779251416c750c8e03","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":947565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiger Darrow","original_name":"Tiger Darrow","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Christine","credit_id":"52fe49779251416c750c8e07","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1137448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Vespe","original_name":"Tony Vespe","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Cameron","credit_id":"52fe49779251416c750c8dfb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1137451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Schroeder","original_name":"Alex Schroeder","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Stacy","credit_id":"52fe49779251416c750c8e0b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1137453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Elliott","original_name":"Rebecca Elliott","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Researcher Sue","credit_id":"52fe49779251416c750c8e13","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2025305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estrella Gonzalez","original_name":"Estrella Gonzalez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Jen","credit_id":"5ad7805e0e0a26433f0000e7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928106,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"C.
