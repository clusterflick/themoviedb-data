Promoting their hit album Brothers in Arms, the tour included a thirteen-night residence at Wembley Arena (featuring Eric Clapton helping out) and a brief jaunt at Live Aid (featuring Sting), before winding up in Australia in the Spring of 86. They ended with a 21-night stand at Sydney's Entertainment Center, packing the place every night, and wrapping it all up with one final show on April 26th. Featuring the one-off calypso version of \"So Far Away\" and an impromtu version of the Australian folk anthem \"Walktzing Matilda\" (with the whole stadium providing the vocals), it is truly a show for the ages.  This show represents a band at their very finest, a band that has perfected the art of transitioning from structured verse/chorus parts to solos and back, bringing the audience along on an emotional and gorgeous journey for each and every song.","popularity":0.4994,"poster_path":"/zVsFid0PhhYfIuo41lKTQQgsCPZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dire Straits: Thank You Australia and New Zealand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Dire Straits - Live in Sidney","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Dire Straits - Thank You Australia","type":"Bootleg DVD"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Knopfler","original_name":"Mark Knopfler","popularity":0.5755,"profile_path":"/1s2Q4Z6UoPOF6hcUbuzGldvGkgn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Guitar, Vocals","credit_id":"52fe49759251416c750c89e9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Illsley","original_name":"John Illsley","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/by2jUUZbmBuQXQ8Xy019393St8y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Bass, Vocals","credit_id":"52fe49759251416c750c89ed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Sonni","original_name":"Jack Sonni","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/431Fe1FxswJJ0jYtkn9ty1EybgF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - Guitar, Vocals","credit_id":"52fe49759251416c750c89f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Clark","original_name":"Alan Clark","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/v1Fvujcmm5iBnS0McCOGp8L10M1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself - Keyboards","credit_id":"52fe49759251416c750c89f5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139560,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guy Fletcher","original_name":"Guy Fletcher","popularity":0.1249,"profile_path":"/xLElt0ioWC8NavhmP5Fs9GJVG2q.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - Keyboards, Vocals","credit_id":"52fe49759251416c750c89f9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris White","original_name":"Chris White","popularity":0.0624,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself - Sax, Flute, Drums","credit_id":"52fe49759251416c750c89fd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Williams","original_name":"Terry Williams","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/inoRcX1GizU9WiFO7To7zzyIHFx.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Himself - Drums","credit_id":"52fe49759251416c750c8a01","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qSX3w3SgiQzF2UHkVIjlMwkRuUR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3JZuLZObGKz6M3GFbyP1alo1v2L.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4XDPHDBhlejHPBKZxCC3IlOhzgM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bxJFioFqFEYxoKEnkQCxnOENavW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zVsFid0PhhYfIuo41lKTQQgsCPZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1062,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ma7WBr5FmGs4Ub6GAYfhyEx0LvE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":709},{"aspect_ratio":0.687,"height":1437,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gWRCzY3xivM1R3L708bVB309Dgy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":987}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":196067,"name":"blues rock"},{"id":211707,"name":"roots rock"},{"id":212520,"name":"pub rock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
