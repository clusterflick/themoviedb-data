(If Albert Einstein, who was rated 1800, were to join the team, he’d only rank fifth best.) Chess has transformed the school from one cited in 2003 as a “school in need of improvement” to one of New York City’s best. But a series of recession-driven public school budget cuts now threaten to undermine those hard-won successes.","popularity":3.1347,"poster_path":"/aHRwEeUjQkzxz7o8NfvYGcws0xW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rescued Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-10-19","revenue":219407,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Imagine a school where the cool kids are the chess team.
