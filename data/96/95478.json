Robert Paige plays roadhouse operator Con Conway, whose establishment is in danger of being squeezed out by its competition. Stranded entertainers Hope Holloway (Jane Frazee) and Gabby Trent (Eve Arden) decide to revivify Conway's establishment by staging an energetic floor show built around the talented Merry Macs. A rival club owner dispatches his two top hooligans Jigsaw Kennedy (Lon Chaney Jr.) and Benny the Bounce (Shemp Howard) to wreck Conway's club by posing as waiters, but the two stupes are easily cowed into submission--by the leading ladies!","popularity":0.8006,"poster_path":"/rRIUPqvllfc2qGC4xemiTcR1gqh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's a Fun-Filled Fiesta!","title":"San Antonio Rose","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Frazee","original_name":"Jane Frazee","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/dhxIqsrzLr9r8rrWlNio9Jkf6hN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hope Holloway","credit_id":"52fe49869251416c750cad8f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Paige","original_name":"Robert Paige","popularity":0.2654,"profile_path":"/3ZwsxO24hm19O73gKIeJbYdbELJ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Con Conway","credit_id":"52fe49869251416c750cad93","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eve Arden","original_name":"Eve Arden","popularity":0.5987,"profile_path":"/54He7YAbDOob0T0dkd4rULfbARz.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gabby Trent","credit_id":"52fe49869251416c750cad97","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lon Chaney Jr.","original_name":"Lon Chaney Jr.","popularity":0.7445,"profile_path":"/xj8gBZ7Vbu1rGm1uaL11MfD8RSe.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Jigsaw Kennedy","credit_id":"52fe49869251416c750cad9b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shemp Howard","original_name":"Shemp Howard","popularity":0.1693,"profile_path":"/b6L3kV2qnputHSsd7uYirjKEMBC.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Benny the Bounce","credit_id":"52fe49869251416c750cad9f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Lane","original_name":"Richard Lane","popularity":0.2662,"profile_path":"/mzGnnilkdUC8Fzoq5z5GhhfV7yd.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Charles J.
