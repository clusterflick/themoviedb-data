The Tulse Luper Suitcases reconstructs the life of Tulse Luper, a professional writer and project-maker, caught up in a life of prisons. He was born in 1911 in Newport, South Wales and presumably last heard of in 1989. His life is reconstructed from the evidence of 92 suitcases found around the world—92 being the atomic number of the element Uranium. The project by Peter Greenaway includes three feature films, a TV series, 92 DVDs, CD-ROMs, and books.","popularity":2.1209,"poster_path":"/49WgZjZoTG8gBYbrnx2wkgevsHU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2004-02-09","revenue":24250,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tulse Luper Suitcases, Part 2: Vaux to the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Tulse Luper 2","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Куфарите на Тълс Лупър, епизод 2: Замъкът Во","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"JJ Feild","original_name":"JJ Feild","popularity":0.4464,"profile_path":"/8YIIH6ebWmIhWWJC3RGe16Z1biK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tulse Luper","credit_id":"52fe4386c3a36847f805ab37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond J.
