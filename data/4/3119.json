His supportive father Les Williams is also a dreamer, who has never been successful in life. When his father dies, his mother becomes lost with two boys, and tries to change the behavior of Earl. One day, the boy finds the \"true Frankenstein\" lost by a Carnival, and decides to bring the monster back to
