Slicker Walburn convinces them they will need \"invisible rays\" to bring it to life which he just happens to have to sell to them. As they rush off to get their money, Slicker gets Boxcar Smith to wear the robot's outer body so when he \"brings\" the robot to life, it will be Boxcar bringing it to life. The gang unsuspectedly gets their robot to mow the lawn at Froggy's house, but with a signal from Slicker, Boxcar runs amok and mows down everything in his path. Froggy gets to explain what happened to his parents who bust up the fraud and get the miscreants to work with the gang to clean up the mess.","popularity":0.7984,"poster_path":"/oph26KBekK3COTCEiaWlAcwmIFd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robot Wrecks","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Blake","original_name":"Robert Blake","popularity":0.4859,"profile_path":"/gxhVHS4qhVp1xJiCy9s08ltIiPu.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mickey","credit_id":"52fe4392c3a36847f805e77d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darla Hood","original_name":"Darla Hood","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/nXqxSjQig8asRbeoqD9CCAC4k5u.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Darla","credit_id":"52fe4392c3a36847f805e785","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Laughlin","original_name":"Billy Laughlin","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":"/yGSAJvnPuNijphmJW4azrHLSRmN.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Froggy","credit_id":"52fe4392c3a36847f805e789","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George McFarland","original_name":"George McFarland","popularity":0.4405,"profile_path":"/quBwmnI4bHufiDIuHb9a7nmw6Ac.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Spanky","credit_id":"52fe4392c3a36847f805e78d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie Thomas","original_name":"Billie Thomas","popularity":0.17,"profile_path":"/w7atHOoODZe0u7aRNe3Dci6mNvq.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Buckwheat","credit_id":"5ac9d9c792514162a2053b42","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Bert","original_name":"Margaret Bert","popularity":0.0915,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Froggy's Mother (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4392c3a36847f805e779","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Bletcher","original_name":"Billy Bletcher","popularity":0.4537,"profile_path":"/ncapDtCeDsMJxEKFXocJTFfnpau.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Froggy's Father (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4392c3a36847f805e781","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward L.
