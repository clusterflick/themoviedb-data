In the interests of conquering the irrational, Salvador Dali opened exhibitions dressed in a diving suit, Marcel Duchamp turned himself into woman, Benjamin Peret assaulted priests, and Yves Tanguy ate spiders. Andre Breton, nicknamed \"the Pope of Surrealism\", led an inspired gang of artists, lunatics and writers. By the 1950s they were denouncing each other for betraying the movement, but their ideas had infected Hollywood, advertising agencies and were turning up as TV humor and album covers.","popularity":0.7234,"poster_path":"/xinNlfQpwgMpf5c8D53Ysm0S7Y5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Europe After the Rain","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Europe After the Rain: Dada and Surrealism","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1234969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Bakewell","original_name":"Joan Bakewell","popularity":0.1444,"profile_path":"/rhej0oHwiT28FciJNATXKbC8MBc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"644cfe5ec1ffbd0342c59a18","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":175910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Cadell","original_name":"Simon Cadell","popularity":0.2656,"profile_path":"/4LnlFp7LEPhUMadnz08vE38pvVl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Poetry Reciter","credit_id":"644cfe6f336e013a577317d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Duchamp","original_name":"Marcel Duchamp","popularity":0.2633,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"644cfe852d1e4004ed773c11","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Ernst","original_name":"Max Ernst","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"644cfe9b53f8330c7e195a2d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nickolas Grace","original_name":"Nickolas Grace","popularity":0.2561,"profile_path":"/gmPM47lFXdK5Gry52Pvs0v45YYf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tristan Tzara","credit_id":"644cfeb02d3721176f0108f0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Petherbridge","original_name":"Edward Petherbridge","popularity":0.1459,"profile_path":"/mJ9hRnEhrNArBrPq1AA8eDgrKkb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Poetry Reciter","credit_id":"644cfec85e14e504e6b8836b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1926897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Clinton","original_name":"Dennis Clinton","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Communist Party Representative","credit_id":"644cfee653f83302fb195a5d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael N.
