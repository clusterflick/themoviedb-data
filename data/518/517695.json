In his stirring tribute to the great filmmaker, Raim examines Ozu's life and work through archival treasures such as his diary and the red teakettle from the family drama \"Equinox Flower\" (1958); sits down with Ozu's nephew and the producer of the director's gently elegiac final film, \"An Autumn Afternoon\" (1962); and interweaves many scenes and images from the vibrant and humane films with which the director capped his career.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/p4Q8LxeQpRj8J2NTyCDvAxzEIqE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10932,"logo_path":"/AscjWwkpQC23EZgRxbeOqs4KhRI.png","name":"The Criterion
