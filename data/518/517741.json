The libretto is comprised of passages from “The Bhagavad-Gita,” India’s greatest philosophical epic, and perfectly complements Glass’ ravishing score, mysteriously transporting the audience with a serene power and an all-encompassing sense of peace.","popularity":0.4534,"poster_path":"/lrZd6EowdUwxOzWHnTQmo7o4lhp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38242,"logo_path":null,"name":"RM
