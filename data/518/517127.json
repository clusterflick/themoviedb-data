He ends up on the other end of the earth and out of his element, but he learns that there are no accidents. Along the way, DJ meets a cast of characters that touch his heart, make him laugh and cause him to rethink everything that he has ever known and thought was true. His journey takes him through the highs and lows of a life that he never knew existed, and he will ultimately be put to the test when tragedy strikes.","popularity":0.5205,"poster_path":"/7rPpcKP1RXfs8Qs0h0rdJKQSbV8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96601,"logo_path":"/tnKR9K9ZgOVGdi4UBPqFRMuWuoI.png","name":"Rossetti
