When Branwell - the ne'er-do-well, tubercular brother of the Brontë sisters - discovered that Emily was writing her first novel, he offered to be her editor. Once he realized that he was the model for the alcoholic Hindley Earnshaw character, he reimagined the story as a musical memoir of his own life with Hindley as the hero. Reconstructed from Branwell's letters to his friend Francis Leyland along with notes, sheet music and damaged film fragments - this 1898 film originally premiered on the 50th anniversary of the consumption deaths of Branwell and Emily Brontë.","popularity":0.1097,"poster_path":"/xJJeCPtIqfHc4qfZsWQ53HG5P0v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Branwell Wuthering Heights 1898","title":"The Drunkard's Lament","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Pinheiro","original_name":"Isabella Pinheiro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/95aFS5lh9OP5og8OOe4xwIQjTUF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Cathy Linton","credit_id":"5de0c3003faba00015087e31","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Montano","original_name":"Linda Montano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Hindley Earnshaw","credit_id":"5de0c31d0cd446001233f0f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murray Gordon","original_name":"Murray Gordon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Heathcliff","credit_id":"5de0c346c51acd0011f55549","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nandini Khaund","original_name":"Nandini Khaund","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Widow","credit_id":"5de0c3ac3faba0001307b056","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2219280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Tarragó","original_name":"Paul Tarragó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Branwell Brontë (voice)","credit_id":"5de0c3cd0cd4460014335c2a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1357849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Timms","original_name":"Sally Timms","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/awiHg9VTdyNNSQUk4F25dik9suX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Singer (voice)","credit_id":"5de0c3e60cd446001933eb98","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cosmina Mazza Finn","original_name":"Cosmina Mazza Finn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5de0c3f64f58010012fe70c3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Mazza Finn","original_name":"Franz Mazza Finn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Linton Heathcliff","credit_id":"5de0c40dc51acd0011f55684","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cat Mazza","original_name":"Cat Mazza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5de0c4323faba00015087f56","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Finn","original_name":"Jim Finn","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/oDKCbuzJTwqZmkK2cHy6M2cSqVn.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5de0c4413faba0001307b237","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Finn","original_name":"Jim Finn","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/oDKCbuzJTwqZmkK2cHy6M2cSqVn.jpg","credit_id":"5ad024320e0a26303c00021f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Finn","original_name":"Jim Finn","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/oDKCbuzJTwqZmkK2cHy6M2cSqVn.jpg","credit_id":"5de0c46ac51acd0015f4a3e8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen Burke","original_name":"Colleen Burke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de0c47f3faba0001307b2a3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2187730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ty Flowers","original_name":"Ty Flowers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de0c4920cd4460014335db7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7311280","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":979,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xJJeCPtIqfHc4qfZsWQ53HG5P0v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":652}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
