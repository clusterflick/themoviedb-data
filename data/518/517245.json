Director and former classmate Andres Veiel organizes a reunion in search of clues. Despite huge differences in their personalities, the course their lives took and how each died, the three young men are indicative of life in a southwestern German small town in the 1980s. Pressure and career expectations from parents clash with adolescent desire for creative or sexual fulfillment. Even years later, the unspoken reflects the unspeakable that plagues the bereaved.","popularity":0.1916,"poster_path":"/hLItBv5HCuIQVnMRqQKZwmLxLyy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Journal-Film Klaus Volkenborn KG","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1996-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Survivors","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Veiel","original_name":"Andres Veiel","popularity":0.0751,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5acbf42bc3a3687e0e01c4e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Veiel","original_name":"Andres Veiel","popularity":0.0751,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679890ba192115901e8f666b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1528031,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Klaus Volkenborn","original_name":"Klaus Volkenborn","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798911a372cb20cf823856f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11249,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bernd Euscher","original_name":"Bernd Euscher","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67989128192115901e8f66b7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27072,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lutz Reitemeier","original_name":"Lutz Reitemeier","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67989136b99d7e78c78f2de8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0118246","wikidata_id":"Q20049436","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":791,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hLItBv5HCuIQVnMRqQKZwmLxLyy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlinale","release_date":"1996-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1996-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
