Diana lives with her mother close to a United States Air Force base. Much of the film consists of her mother berating Diana about not having a boyfriend. When her mother leaves the room, Diana changes into her Wonder Woman costume and admires her reflection in a mirror. What she sees is not Diana Prince, but rather a sexy super-heroic figure (played by Linda Harrison) who proceeds to preen and pose as the song \"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\" plays on the soundtrack.","popularity":0.4562,"poster_path":"/uYnljmC20FK7F3hFi7onRYq3bJx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greenway Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wonder Woman: Who's Afraid of Diana Prince?","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1779783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellie Wood Walker","original_name":"Ellie Wood Walker","popularity":0.2204,"profile_path":"/6Flv4aDLL9HNXCfwOlaetmr198p.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Diana Prince/Wonder Woman","credit_id":"5acabb2f92514143410059a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":151503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maudie Prickett","original_name":"Maudie Prickett","popularity":0.3818,"profile_path":"/hj5WNiyFWLOyqO5TxX3ywYNJEcF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Diana's Mother","credit_id":"5acabb46c3a3687e48006389","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Harrison","original_name":"Linda Harrison","popularity":1.093,"profile_path":"/9TGLtHHLwGY4THTt1StPdf1tngF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wonder Woman's Reflection","credit_id":"5acabb5a9251414322005e33","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie H.
