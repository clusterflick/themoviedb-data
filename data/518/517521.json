His wife is running out of life-sustaining medicine, their young daughter is missing in the storm, electricity and phone communication have been cut off, and their food and water are running out. As He Tianying cares for his dying wife, in this isolation and confinement, his conscience starts to emerge. As a policeman, he has been involved in the vicious persecution of common Chinese citizens who follow the spiritual practice of Falun Gong. In a series of flashbacks, he painfully recalls one particular Falun Gong practitioner whom he had been attempting to force to renounce her beliefs.","popularity":0.3837,"poster_path":"/zVFn7f7ITzOYJCxHgFRaJPJfFhC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Requisite Films","origin_country":""},{"id":165770,"logo_path":null,"name":"NTD Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":165771,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Tang Dynasty Films","origin_country":""},{"id":165772,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wildcat Releasing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The darkest moments can reveal the deepest truths","title":"Sandstorm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3335161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lili Li","original_name":"Lili Li","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"The Practitioner","credit_id":"61ab7adbd6d64d72ee55ffff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3335162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Huang","original_name":"Angela Huang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Young Policewoman","credit_id":"61ab7aeb6728a8008bc5bef7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3335164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Hong","original_name":"Steve Hong","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Supervisor","credit_id":"61ab7afa0b5fd6001918af11","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2701425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guang Cheng","original_name":"Guang Cheng","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Young Policeman","credit_id":"61ab7b08001bbd00417f4a22","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3335165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rong Tian","original_name":"Rong Tian","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"He Tian Ying","credit_id":"61ab7b17cb75d10063204839","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1227521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Mahonen","original_name":"Michael Mahonen","popularity":0.3949,"profile_path":"/maWPWVMDoM63MFfO9rsgTLN2BMs.jpg","credit_id":"61ab7a48fe5c91008d4d7a55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1227521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Mahonen","original_name":"Michael Mahonen","popularity":0.3949,"profile_path":"/maWPWVMDoM63MFfO9rsgTLN2BMs.jpg","credit_id":"61ab7a52d6d64d72ee55ff21","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3335157,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Boudreau","original_name":"Rebecca Boudreau","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ab7a68d8f44e0043948e30","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1227521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Mahonen","original_name":"Michael Mahonen","popularity":0.3949,"profile_path":"/maWPWVMDoM63MFfO9rsgTLN2BMs.jpg","credit_id":"61ab7a72bf09d10068e6d420","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1974064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Chai","original_name":"David Chai","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ab7a800cd44600882d44b8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1974064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Chai","original_name":"David Chai","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ab7a85001bbd006179a321","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3335158,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Manna Hu","original_name":"Manna Hu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ab7a90bf09d10095c23cf8","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3335159,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Christi Johnson","original_name":"Christi Johnson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ab7a9fd8cc4a001d1ccad5","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743157,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dianne E.
