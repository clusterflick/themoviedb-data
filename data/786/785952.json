But maybe more important things never seem to be told. Soon after the director moves into her 22nd house, she gets a phone call that her Grandma, who lives far away, is in a critical condition. Elsewhere, a huge apartment made of sand is being constructed as the tide rolls in, while she belatedly tries to build a relationship with her Gran. As the camera sensitively observes how we wait for the upcoming days, the film embraces the fragility of life, full of uncertainty.","popularity":0.1298,"poster_path":"/aTjWCpYhbda42yq3sYQx2pA33tY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way We Wait","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4797109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Young-Ja Kim","original_name":"Young-Ja Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"667ce07dfb39b85a148cfa40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4797110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tae-Yeon Kang","original_name":"Tae-Yeon Kang","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"667ce088fc73279e12b92870","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4795896,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Julian Triandafyllou","original_name":"Julian Triandafyllou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667c14090f528e6bb71850dd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2839256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ji-Yoon Park","original_name":"Ji-Yoon Park","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667c14271cc035d8f9f9b9d5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4795901,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ji-Yoon Park","original_name":"Ji-Yoon Park","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667c147b39405c382faa6f1d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Davie","original_name":"Emma Davie","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667c1458a25483ea7eb8ca0c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2839256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ji-Yoon Park","original_name":"Ji-Yoon Park","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667c144a5c23b05cd5d23103","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2839256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ji-Yoon Park","original_name":"Ji-Yoon Park","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64becf66c51acd00af639891","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13575880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xZUEHaXIdcFYmBVyTZp0eSM2tds.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":808,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTjWCpYhbda42yq3sYQx2pA33tY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":539},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aYauzursXuriOYejfuitKmTBVnb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Open City Documentary Festival ","release_date":"2020-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
