When the tiger stopped at the entrance of a cave, the goats in the cave were frightened, but with an idea, it thought of a good way. The goat pretended to be the king, shouted that the tiger meat was delicious, and told the tiger to enter the cave quickly. Later, thinking about it, he was worried that the tiger might really break in, so he simply walked out of the cave, and then used his wisdom to scare the tiger out of his wits.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/zgA7DfwWp0aEki2DA5ggm7Ygx9c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shanghai Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1956-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Clever Goat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Jìzhì dé shānyáng","type":"(original title)"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Jizhi de shanyang","type":"(original title simplified)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2932831,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kejun Zhao","original_name":"Kejun Zhao","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d1212af30a7b3c8003aefe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1925657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xi Jin","original_name":"Xi Jin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vI9hBE83cPXL2tostqMAmSgSKgM.jpg","credit_id":"5ffd8339c3c8910042716a2f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2933219,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jinhui LI","original_name":"Jinhui LI","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffd838320af77003d1fc4f4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2933216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wan Chaochen","original_name":"Wan Chaochen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffd8312de11e5003ef3a716","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2933218,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Xi Lei","original_name":"Xi Lei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffd834d47c9fb00417af6e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13820894","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/zgA7DfwWp0aEki2DA5ggm7Ygx9c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1956-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
