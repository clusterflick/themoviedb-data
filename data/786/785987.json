Starved Rock? Lake Geneva?  The Dells?  Maybe the Indiana Dunes?  Or Michigan’s Harbor Country? The road trip is a time-honored tradition. “Are we there yet?” is a familiar refrain, but with Geoffrey Baer behind the wheel, you’ll be asking, “Where are we going next?”  WTTW takes Chicago on Vacation to the beloved lakes, resorts, and towns we go to escape life in the city—and the stops we make along the way. Through archival film, old home movies, testimonials, interviews, and beautiful new footage, Geoffrey explores these cherished destinations for rest and recreation now, and in generations past.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chicago on Vacation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Baer","original_name":"Geoffrey Baer","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/yR1vMIXjkIMpI6jDFUGNEqgzJER.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself/Host","credit_id":"6001d125aa659e003e9302bd","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9887384","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
