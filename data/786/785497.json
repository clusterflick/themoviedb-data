It stars Dean Cain (Superman), Kristy Swanson (Buffy The Vampire Slayer), and John James (Dynasty). The film’s script is unusual in that it is completely verbatim and consists of the text messages, declassified files, congressional and court transcripts, tweets, and statements of top government and FBI officials.  And it also features the embarrassing and conspiratorial text messages of “FBI Lovebirds” Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Obamagate also features appearances by James Comey and the Obama CIA Chief James Brennan and their cringeworthy tweets read aloud. Co-produced by the Unreported Story Society and Tom Fitton's Judicial Watch, the ObamaGate Movie exposes the Deep State plot to undermine the Trump candidacy and presidency and it reveals the lies behind the fake Russia Collusion narrative.","popularity":0.5094,"poster_path":"/jWXGNn6agPDiIOgFMw2SzfRf9L1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171544,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Unreported Story Society","origin_country":"US"},{"id":219199,"logo_path":null,"name":"Judicial Watch (US)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Trump's not ever going to become president, right?\" \"No, he's not.
