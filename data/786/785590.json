We will follow the long journey of his life, from his childhood in a small village of Apulia, until the transfer to the United States; the transition from a peasant civilization of the early 1900s to that of a great metropolis projected into the future. The dreams of a poor child who leaves his mother and his land to seek fortune overseas, will come true on the circuits where his car will force every opponent to eat his dust.","popularity":0.1642,"poster_path":"/upEXo1ktqI5jBI6kkJd9V2wodXY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151670,"logo_path":null,"name":"MAC Film","origin_country":""},{"id":151671,"logo_path":null,"name":"Twisterfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ralph De Palma: The Fastest Man on Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1879926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandra Carrillo","original_name":"Alessandra Carrillo","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/AuiywrCN2uA3gjUBxzpsdwHxCAx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffeb52afea0d7003d8d72e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincenzo De Michele","original_name":"Vincenzo De Michele","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/nJDRHAZFh7QrVlVdfYWKKXaa9cN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffeb531594c94003f8ec914","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone Montedoro","original_name":"Simone Montedoro","popularity":0.2897,"profile_path":"/hlyp67XKqqfc6EOnpbjmNqPTho7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffeb538678259003e9a9756","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1822552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandro Tersigni","original_name":"Alessandro Tersigni","popularity":0.2692,"profile_path":"/boqkUdC5hJNdT4gMlSrZ3PxqiZr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffeb54090cf51003c4d0fdc","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2373535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Silvestre","original_name":"Antonio Silvestre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffeb51d90cf51003d4d28c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11803876","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/57vu3pwUNdpPzWnqfPSLvNkc8oH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/upEXo1ktqI5jBI6kkJd9V2wodXY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1497},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/1KlGoH6WPEqW4xmhIheNzYeyzDB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
