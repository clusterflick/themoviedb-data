Steam locomotives are captured in action as they traverse the 20 mile route between Bishops Lydeard and the coastal resort of Minehead.  Stunning scenery provides a back-drop as we witness a large selection of mainly Great Western associated motive-power negotiating taxing gradients as they pass through the stunning landscape in the shadow of the Quantock and Brendon Hills.  Intermediate stations include Crowcombe Heathfield, famous for the part it played in the Beatles Hard Days Night movie, Stogumber, Williton, Doniford Halt,Watchet, Washford, Blue Anchor and Dunster, which stands on the coastal plain overlooked by the famous Dunster Castle.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":147261,"logo_path":null,"name":"On Track Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steam Scenes: The West Somerset Railway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"On Track Productions: Steam Scenes No.2 - The West Somerset Railway","key":"IxnM3CRKDMw","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-07-18T16:17:19.000Z","id":"5ffdafcf0fb17f003b421bc6"}]}}}
