In a series of mises-en-scène shot only in natural light, we see a domestic setting overrun by a pack of dogs that roam around restlessly, attacking objects and furniture. The interior of this home is a mental space, violated and lacerated like a body that has undergone violence. Fruit, game, and remnants of food are arranged like still lifes, with allegorical elements evoking the precariousness of life and the loss of innocence.","popularity":0.1903,"poster_path":"/AeNtjc7o8JbU8eOYHUzZDGXYypC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76361,"logo_path":null,"name":"In Between Art
