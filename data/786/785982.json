Never before have classics like the 400E, Olympian, National Limited, and the Hiawatha pranced about in such realistic scenery - mountains, groundcover, tunnels and trees. Accessories include the Power Station, Hellgate Bridge, Terrace Station, and many more - even two loops for the Lionel Race Cars and a Snow Village Christmas scene.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celebrity Train Layouts Part 2: Tom Snyder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0383968","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
