And because people again and again told him that his voice sounded lovely, he decided to make a career as a musician and go to Bremen. On his way, he met a dog, whose fate was to spend the rest of his life in the animal asylum, because his old master had died. The dog was a great drummer, so the donkey asked him to come along with him. On their way they met a cock and a cat, who were also living in a desperate situation. Since they too were good musicians, it was only logical that they completed the band. And what nobody ever believed came true. After many adventures, they were finally on stage. Where? Of course in Bremen.","popularity":0.3381,"poster_path":"/ut6M9TZMIrzd0NFaGmkzqJJXkEI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dingo
