Whilst others have painted one image or another of Donner, John Webster’s interpretation differs in that it pulls most of its material from Donner’s last-intended interview in December 2019, and an immense never-before-seen collection of photographs from albums simply labelled “Donner – Privat”. As a result, the film morphs into an epilogue of sorts, of Donner’s life story.","popularity":0.178,"poster_path":"/hJc3A83LvBkbaVTilOg6JJu1xoT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79811,"logo_path":"/jSzhkuSGhdQtKulhYDGNS4Ig01E.png","name":"Bufo","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2021-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Donner
