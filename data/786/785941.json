In 1980, he decided, however, to leave his career to write a book. Not any book; he wanted to write his prediction about the future, which became for him a life-long project.  Combining archive material, interviews, and dramatizations, the film Tidresenären brings the viewer closer to Wahlforss’s fascinating life and predictions.","popularity":0.1412,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":147384,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parad","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2021-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Future Remains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Aikamatkaaja","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2957005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrik Wahlforss","original_name":"Henrik Wahlforss","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6014483acb8028003e0a657a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2957072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leif O.
