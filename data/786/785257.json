Intermediate stations exist at Kelling Heath, a halt also built during the preservation era and Weybourne, where the locomotive fleet is based with restoration and maintenance also being carried out here.  Steam trains are captured in action along the route which, despite the county of Norfolk's mainly \"flat land\" image, features gradients that make locomotives work for their living. Occasionaly trains are seen with the North Sea as a backdrop, a reminder that the line would once have carried holiday makers for a welcomed break from the industrial heartlands of the north and the midlands.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steam Scenes: The North Norfolk Railway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
