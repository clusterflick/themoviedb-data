Several over bridges, three original stations, signal boxes and signaling, working mail exchange equipment and reservoir viaducts, all combine to recreate a past era. Add to this both visiting and resident preserved steam locomotives and a whole host of coaches and rolling stock, which can be used to assemble together many different types of train configuration, and todayâ€™s Great Central Railway has without a doubt restored the atmosphere of a railway as it was in the days of steam.  This DVD captures sequences of a number of steam locomotives and train formations at work in several locations along the entire length of the 8 mile preserved railway from Loughborough Central to the newly constructed southern terminus station at Leicester North.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steam Scenes: The Great Central Railway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
