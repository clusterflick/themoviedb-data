It is today the longest preserved\r standard guage line in the principality and trains are seen passing along\r the scenic Dee Valley.  Featuring a variety of steam locomotives, the railway is captured throughout\r its full running length, with the six stations that exist to serve passengers\r also being seen, including the site that is being developed as the future\r terminus station at Corwen.  The locomotive department that today occupies what was once the\r Llangollen Goods Shed and Yard is also featured, together with the often\r busy Llangollen Goods Junction.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steam Scenes: The Llangollen Railway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
