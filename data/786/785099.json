While the film will remain cutting edge in it's display of riding, the crew pushed hard to create a visual that is compelling to all sorts of boarders (something snowboarding lacks big time at the moment), reinforcing an idea we've been pushing in all our movies: unite in the spirit of unfettered adventure. All you really need is your board, your friends and a bit of help from Mother Nature.","popularity":0.0858,"poster_path":"/8IXHS5Pis5B052Qnk55m3X3LeA3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Method Movie 3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10789834","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8IXHS5Pis5B052Qnk55m3X3LeA3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
