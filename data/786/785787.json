Women saved men, heroes died unwept and unsung, whites lived with Indians and benefited from the experience. Three of her stories were made into films and many critics consider \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" to be the cornerstone of the modern western. This documentary looks back on Dorothy's life, and her place in history.","popularity":0.4871,"poster_path":"/mXFnWNPecixRASFndvPNKXaLTFW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gravel In Her Gut and Spit In Her Eye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margot Kidder","original_name":"Margot Kidder","popularity":1.2484,"profile_path":"/bqFP3Tnd40ff9GzaBzqfNxWZkFq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dorothy M.
