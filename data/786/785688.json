It's very reductionist because I was interested in dealing with the computer and the digital imaging process on its own terms. The only analog image is a voltage-controlled moving square created with the Rutt/Etra synthesizer. I used that image pattern through which to key and genlock other computer-created textures and square shapes. I was using a program called \"Clear Center\" where the pixel is routed from the center of the raster all the way around the rectangles in either direction at very high speed. By controlling the luminance and width of the pixel you get different kinds of textures within the square. Here, the square is articulated as an evolving architecture in time-from classical space (Greece) to outer space (Jupiter) using light energy as the building material.\" - B.B.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cJ5CiLmg52PJp93LAKZQg74ASFr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greece to Jupiter: It's a Matter of Energy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Buckner","original_name":"Barbara Buckner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fff16d6cb3084003cd439e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":1640,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cJ5CiLmg52PJp93LAKZQg74ASFr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
