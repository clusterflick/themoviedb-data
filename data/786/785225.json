Shot entirely in the UK, it consists of a diverse series of arresting ‘films within a film’, each presented as if made about us from the perspective of the animals whose lives we may appear to celebrate, but continue to exploit and to destroy. While John Berger doesn’t appear in the film and wasn’t directly involved in it’s making, he narrates to great effect the text he co-wrote to accompany the film’s provocative opening sequence.","popularity":0.0811,"poster_path":"/bOfTFXYzbp7cG6QjsWZZ5JkaYg3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parting Shots from Animals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Berger","original_name":"John Berger","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":"/m8pMStl7CAsjVvDYdcCNJyxalab.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (narrator)","credit_id":"5ffd88a70fb17f003c43526b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356292,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christopher Rawlence","original_name":"Christopher Rawlence","popularity":0.0611,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffd8726de11e5003ff25a30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Berger","original_name":"John Berger","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":"/m8pMStl7CAsjVvDYdcCNJyxalab.jpg","credit_id":"5ffd874ce19de9003e19ce40","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Dibb","original_name":"Mike Dibb","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/cCQQSpkwfaG45vQmAnaKd2i28bA.jpg","credit_id":"5ffd8714fcec2e003e196175","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576175,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Malcolm Kipling","original_name":"Malcolm Kipling","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffd877a20af77003f1ed4d4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lWnr0Fcgxx5McahDTRgM1Res4Tw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":956,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bOfTFXYzbp7cG6QjsWZZ5JkaYg3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
