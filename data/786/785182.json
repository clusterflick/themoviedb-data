At the beginning of the story, five couples are sitting on the benches and embracing. A 99-year-old lady appears in the park to gather cigarette butts. A poet sees her and admonishes her for disturbing the lovers and for using a park bench that rightfully belongs to those in love. They debate life and love. The old lady confesses that when young she was a beautiful woman and was admired by Captain Fukakusa. Upon describing a dance she attended, she and the poet find themselves at the dance, many years earlier, in Rokumei Hall, a ballroom where many handsome men and beautiful women are dancing. Everyone in the ballroom recognizes the old woman as the beautiful Komachi and comment on her beauty.","popularity":0.2439,"poster_path":"/qVn9jVQKaUreq52DEb4M2V0BGXk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sotoba Komachi","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Надгробие Комати","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinobu Terajima","original_name":"寺島しのぶ","popularity":1.7311,"profile_path":"/tOk9ggHemFL5FCvhfYeIkyS3Fk9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Old woman","credit_id":"5ffd3b1d1089ba0041cb6cb0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yukiya Kitamura","original_name":"北村有起哉","popularity":0.6009,"profile_path":"/qbUKeVee8IPNHZ2aelTDWbGkx7P.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Poet","credit_id":"5ffd3b2d1089ba0040cba30d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kichitaro Negishi","original_name":"根岸吉太郎","popularity":0.2309,"profile_path":"/ycGiJzCQnmG0i10Fw3wypruzWyP.jpg","credit_id":"5ffd3b018b959e003d40e92b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140102,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yukio Mishima","original_name":"三島由紀夫","popularity":0.5541,"profile_path":"/c6uskrzHB3zYOly4Hr3DD5ibjWu.jpg","credit_id":"5ffd3f95470ead003fbaadd6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cby5kCHMvo8btTcMyyka0HCdJIa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qVn9jVQKaUreq52DEb4M2V0BGXk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ja\", \"native_name\"=>\"Japanese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
