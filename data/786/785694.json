His only consolation are his visits to Dr. Drudy, a psychiatrist whom he can tell about the love of his life - the President of Ireland. A new motorway puts Timmy's guesthouse off the map. A strange Spanish pilot named Marcel comes to visit and create havoc in the guesthouse. Timmy goes to a scriptwriters' conference where only fast, urban and up-beat stories are expected, nothing like Timmy's own story. Uneasy in any of the four provinces of Ireland, he desperately tries to reach the Fifth Province, the province of magic, of passion, of possibility.","popularity":1.0171,"poster_path":"/bkHW8S7vhOvdI2bgfHX4qVzCqCm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1997-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fifth Province","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lia Williams","original_name":"Lia Williams","popularity":0.948,"profile_path":"/d7BIswSeHeAdIobNjsWEFG2uj1H.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Diana De Brie","credit_id":"5fff1c597d5db5003dc965f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Higgins","original_name":"Anthony Higgins","popularity":0.5771,"profile_path":"/97ldqHkMzAyGCZZGozJA7RGMpDN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marcel","credit_id":"5fff1ca30ff15a00405bc16a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brían F.
