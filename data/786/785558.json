Aldar means deceiver, Kos - beardless. And what was the name of this man in fact, and whether he lived at all, no one will say for sure. But in every Kazakh village, in every yurt in the mountainous Dzhailau, they talk about Aldar Kos as their good friend. He tells about him in different ways, but everything converges on the fact that he was poor and kind, hated the oppressors of the people, fought against injustice and helped the offended... Like a tumbleweed bush, Aldar Koshe, who was forever wandering through the boundless Kazakh steppes, once met a beautiful woman and fell in love with her. But the girl loves another — a brave, honest and kind poor man, herding the herds of a rich man.","popularity":0.1325,"poster_path":"/zRP7rtJDnh9Fv3AWtlLiQd0ohgx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":232195,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kazakhfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1965-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beardless Deceiver","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Aldar Kose","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Безбородый обманщик","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yeleubai Umurzakov","original_name":"Yeleubai Umurzakov","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/yf5arHWhY5Y1ow6aPqLCZL2RH17.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Isa Baksy","credit_id":"60969bb0356a71003fc713f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shaken Aimanov","original_name":"Шакен Айманов","popularity":0.6806,"profile_path":"/xfwc1LMpQ63N1KryX2Nh93p03ot.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Aldar-Kose","credit_id":"60969bd2b2e074003d6e5c71","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2728535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanat Zhailibekov","original_name":"Tanat Zhailibekov","popularity":0.0675,"profile_path":"/yP0bH4cOQ2qgirh7IvSflB0y838.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"60969bfddd2589003dec8e01","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serke Kozhamkulov","original_name":"Serke Kozhamkulov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/wOyFwadEovkybbBSRrbx9HQlsM2.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60969c11a055ef003ebc7741","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2437662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kapan Badyrov","original_name":"Капан Бадыров","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lQh8ZK63anWjj3S7r6H1Bs3LWEY.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"60969c4a9bcd0f003b75e814","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4529266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bayan Adilova","original_name":"Bayan Adilova","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/c1LRDBQjNb9PKdfLfAUWHaNO0hT.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Karlygash","credit_id":"65c7c360ce6c4c017cb96106","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2429405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kuatbay Abdreimov","original_name":"Куатбай Абдреимов","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/rATOVPUonqy43wQTmBAX7BFUfS9.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67a8b24adf55e8f213f131a4","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shaken Aimanov","original_name":"Шакен Айманов","popularity":0.6806,"profile_path":"/xfwc1LMpQ63N1KryX2Nh93p03ot.jpg","credit_id":"60969b63b34409003db80aa3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shaken Aimanov","original_name":"Шакен Айманов","popularity":0.6806,"profile_path":"/xfwc1LMpQ63N1KryX2Nh93p03ot.jpg","credit_id":"60969b6d9661fc003c98bb86","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3083236,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lev Varshavskiy","original_name":"Lev Varshavskiy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60969b957f0540003bbda355","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0169609","wikidata_id":"Q110741209","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/xD9peodeqkdsyMCOBsE2bAuo5CX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":892,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zRP7rtJDnh9Fv3AWtlLiQd0ohgx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":633}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1965-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
