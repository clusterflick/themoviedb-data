Through this character, Kim explores the Mongolian animist belief that positions land, mother rock, stones, and sacred caves at the center of their universe. By likening rocks and stones as the Earth’s memory storage vessel, the work illuminates the futurist potential of animism: “Quartz can be considered to be a type of natural computer since it absorbs and stores a large amount of energy“. The traditional spirituality oriented towards land or ancient animism reveals the potential equivalence between primeval objects and the futuristic memory sphere.","popularity":0.0847,"poster_path":"/wgFN9RmGAOLjPRHyMjkrGJgj0dJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2019-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mongolian","iso_639_1":"mn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Petrogenesis, Petra Genetrix","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2933495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yundenbat Boldbaatar","original_name":"Yundenbat Boldbaatar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Historian","credit_id":"5ffdd3b0e19de9003f187e87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2933496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bulgantamir Odkhuu","original_name":"Bulgantamir Odkhuu","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Geologist","credit_id":"5ffdd3b80fb17f003d431d28","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2528313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Ayoung","original_name":"Kim Ayoung","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/kpeIgRvqS8Ix2KfKBJd27ZplI6I.jpg","credit_id":"65686788680be800adb667f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2159068,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oh Hee-jung","original_name":"오희정","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffdd3d1470ead003fbb8686","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2933500,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Uuganbayar Ganbaatar","original_name":"Uuganbayar Ganbaatar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffdd3dfe19de900401924e6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wgFN9RmGAOLjPRHyMjkrGJgj0dJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Korea Artist Prize, MMCA Seoul, Korea","release_date":"2019-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Migration: Speaking Nearby, Asia Culture Center, Gwangju, Korea","release_date":"2019-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":" Frequencies of Tradition, KADIST Online Video Exhibition","release_date":"2020-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
