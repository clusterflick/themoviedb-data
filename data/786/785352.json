But for the past several years, the teenagers have been stuck in Zaatari, the world’s largest camp for Syrian refugees, located in Jordan. With uncertain legal status and an interrupted education, their prospects are limited. On the local soccer pitch, however, they can imagine a brighter future as professional athletes, a path to escaping the camp and providing for their families. When scouts from a world-renowned Qatari sports academy visit Zaatari, Fawzi and Mahmoud believe they might be able to realize their dreams—if given the opportunity.","popularity":0.2139,"poster_path":"/idxD1BPCcHJpaciBQe24BJW8k5V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13150,"logo_path":"/v9s0IXHruAX6APhu08b8FItrIf1.png","name":"Naked Edge
