When a mixture of different groups on the French colony of Saint Domingue rose against the colonists, few expected the rebellion to succeed. However, under the leadership of figures such as Toussaint L'Ouverture, Henry Christophe and Jean-Jacques Dessalines the Haitians became one of the few peoples to not only successfully rebel against their masters, but also to success in retaining control over the colony. This documentary looks into the story of the Haitian Revolution and how its legacy endures to this day.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Independence or Death: The Haitian Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2934488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Bowsher","original_name":"Mark Bowsher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffeddd1ad59b5003dfb464f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
