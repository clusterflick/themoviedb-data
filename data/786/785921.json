In between filming, Mohsen lets Maya off the leash and allows her to roam in this sparsely populated landscape – she is the first ‘free’ tiger in Iran in over 60 years. But instead of the perfect experience of the wild that Mohsen hopes it to be, the trip kickstarts a series of events that mark the end of Mohsen and Maya’s relationship and in the process reveals a much darker and more complex side to Mohsen and the Zoo in which Maya and the other animals are kept.","popularity":0.1444,"poster_path":"/gvGsXGABy7KDTSUsnBEhw6YiEFR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147375,"logo_path":null,"name":"Banyak Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2020-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maya","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935882,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Reza Jafarzadeh","original_name":"Reza Jafarzadeh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b9dea0c2f44b0040b67fe9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935884,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Majid Tahermanesh","original_name":"Majid Tahermanesh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b9de98dfaae9005780b916","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935888,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hassan Balalii","original_name":"Hassan Balalii","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600021667d5db5003bcb6e9d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266027,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ollie Huddleston","original_name":"Ollie Huddleston","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6000215ac0348b003d33eefa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anson Hartford","original_name":"Anson Hartford","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60001f98ad59b5003efc94c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugh Hartford","original_name":"Hugh Hartford","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6000214b67825900409dd063","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugh Hartford","original_name":"Hugh Hartford","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6000217d326c19003d7f4152","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamshid Mojaddadi","original_name":"Jamshid Mojaddadi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60001f8c594c94003f90b078","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anson Hartford","original_name":"Anson Hartford","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6000213f223e20003fb23f2c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11199704","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gvGsXGABy7KDTSUsnBEhw6YiEFR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7D93lXEzmc8pYV8Zd4opa0lGRrn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1716,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/riks8JGXq0TucQjxSBVs2Um6RyL.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1144},{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1716,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uzvolQ3Jy84jrOOCf8aFM88pqwi.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1199}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Zurich Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"One World Online","release_date":"2021-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"On The Edge West International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MAYA - trailer","key":"yzsjjs596-E","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-21T21:27:42.000Z","id":"60b9ded118b75100296f1c16"}]}}}
