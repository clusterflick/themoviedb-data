For years Drew Hayden Taylor, prolific playwright and author of dozens of Canadian-Indigenous books, has noticed a high proportion of German tourists visiting Canada, many who have come looking for a real \"Indianer\" experience (what Germans call the North American Native lifestyle). Inevitably, almost every one of these Germans will relate stories of Winnetou: Germany's most famous, but mythical, Apache warrior. Winnetou was their childhood hero. As one museum curator explained: \"Winnetou is like Superman for the German people\". Fascinated with this phenomenon Taylor spent last summer in Germany trying to uncover the over 100-year roots of its Winnetou obsession. There Taylor revealed camps where thousands of Germans dress and attempt to live like Indigenous people.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cV1tNDACtsOUL6eGANmnDv6E2WD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching for Winnetou","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2023077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Red Haircrow","original_name":"Red Haircrow","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fff45bfad59b5003dfc12de","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7958836","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zDhXxA2SujkftOjzQ8DaJnj8vs9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1310,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cV1tNDACtsOUL6eGANmnDv6E2WD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":924}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
