She’s a Telepath–someone who can read minds. It’s a talent she’s never known how to explain. Everything changes the day she meets Fitz, a mysterious boy who appears out of nowhere, and who can also read minds like her. She discovers there’s somewhere she does belong, and that staying with her family will put her in grave danger. In the blink of an eye, Sophie is forced to leave behind everything and start a new life in a place that is vastly different from what she has ever known.","popularity":1.0406,"poster_path":"/xoaAJ4U4dMSmvXYBcNs0WkQVeYE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2,"logo_path":"/wdrCwmRnLFJhEoH8GSfymY85KHT.png","name":"Walt Disney Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":29313,"logo_path":"/1whsMqm5kAPxKBhnTlKNcbXBQJK.png","name":"Pearl Street Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"","title":"Keeper of the Lost Cities","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Affleck","original_name":"Ben Affleck","popularity":5.6127,"profile_path":"/aTcqu8cI4wMohU17xTdqmXKTGrw.jpg","credit_id":"5ffc942d1c04350040bf09be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2932150,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shannon Messenger","original_name":"Shannon Messenger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffc9444fcec2e00411921ce","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2932151,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kate Gritmon","original_name":"Kate Gritmon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffc946bde11e50040f299c2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2050917,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Madison Ainley","original_name":"Madison Ainley","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/agmAeVEEBkqaLZMY46kaSZxwQpk.jpg","credit_id":"5ffc947b1d0191003fa16cf6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13825848","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1926,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xoaAJ4U4dMSmvXYBcNs0WkQVeYE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1284}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
