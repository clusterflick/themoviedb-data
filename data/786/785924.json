The same endless piles of trash left by humans cover all the shores. Our shared ocean is loaded with time travelers made of plastic, the fruit of our throwaway culture and our indifference. They are the seeds of destruction, as they end up in the entrails of creatures living in the sea. Most of the beachcombers share the same worries about the environment. Beside the plastic trash, many travelers drift between continents, such as various plants’ seeds. Like all species, they look for new living environments where they could survive on a warming planet.","popularity":0.1856,"poster_path":"/w2cjIDYoXtaLQ4MeKbufadJHJQW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33380,"logo_path":"/clYqCO5abrqHIZtw5PYE5MupdMw.png","name":"Tuffi
