Ignacio (11) is celebrating his First Communion, a step that, according to catholics, puts him closer to God and opens up a space for him in the believers community. Communion implies, he will have enough grace to go to Paradise one day. It is also the day he is declared as a “conscious” person. However, from long time before, his tutor, sister Josefa, and the priest of the church, have said terrible things about his dead father, a communist that by now, as they say, should be burning in hell’s fire.","popularity":0.0605,"poster_path":"/sIAZimci3nY5oAuHLbQkz4iJ86h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157392,"logo_path":null,"name":"BOGOSHORTS Film
