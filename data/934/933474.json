Your mission: to voyage where few have gone before--behind the scenes of Star Trek: The Next Generation! Join Jonathan Frakes, Next Generation's Commander William Riker, for this fascinating chronicle of Gene Roddenberry's beloved, Emmy Award-winning series. You'll explore the Enterprise, meet the show's stars (and some villainous guest stars), learn special-effects secrets and makeup magic, and finally get the answer to that nagging question, \"Where is the bathroom on the Enterprise?\" Other highlights include a visit to a Star Trek convention, and a stop at the scoring stage to watch Marina Sirtis (Lt. Commander Deanna Troi) lead the orchestra in a recording session. This program concludes with a special look at the series' thrilling final episode (\"All Good Things . . .\") and a sneak peak at the crew's movie debut, Star Trek: Generations. So set a course for an adventure like no other.","popularity":2.8551,"poster_path":"/qEooIkZgC7qe3rM78v5DuUd66cG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beam aboard the Starship Enterprise for an exclusive journey through the past and into the future of Star Trek: The Next Generation.","title":"Journey's End - The Saga of Star Trek: The Next Generation","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Frakes","original_name":"Jonathan Frakes","popularity":1.3358,"profile_path":"/b6ljJL0sn9VGoivLF3AH5sX1lcK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Host / Self","credit_id":"61f92508559d220105d1f631","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Stewart","original_name":"Patrick Stewart","popularity":2.1942,"profile_path":"/3yExCGqCMfSOVVHdEYTJhXaTtFZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f92514fe6c18009383637a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Crosby","original_name":"Denise Crosby","popularity":0.7877,"profile_path":"/1Eoo8o3xRGflJ9kHxg1eFVwAwQa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f92524b7abb500e88b2da7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"LeVar Burton","original_name":"LeVar Burton","popularity":0.6994,"profile_path":"/tC74tISKpFGmJkrw24MMLix5nNa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f925307a97ab011f96ff70","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213783,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rick Berman","original_name":"Rick Berman","popularity":0.1929,"profile_path":"/mEznRUFYLmpD6jPPeZKLWkHtPdn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f9253d6dc507004490e1ca","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brent Spiner","original_name":"Brent Spiner","popularity":0.8051,"profile_path":"/wHaOTfxOEKOPssDYaSSB5zenml4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f92549b7abb5001b25f879","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Dorn","original_name":"Michael Dorn","popularity":0.7,"profile_path":"/6mVjb0YsidC0gW9P8mXMkQirfcK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f925580c4c1600dc071eae","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Sirtis","original_name":"Marina Sirtis","popularity":1.299,"profile_path":"/xMrHyXrv21suNglAHD24GDY7Uhx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f92563559d22009148c465","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1219348,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeri Taylor","original_name":"Jeri Taylor","popularity":0.1874,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f9256ecb802800ec069bc9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2536085,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Richard D.
