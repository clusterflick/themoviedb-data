The day after he arrives, he dresses up in his uncle's hat, cartridge belt, chaps, etc., and is about to take an old gun from the wall to put in his belt when his uncle asks him not to take the gun, as he prizes it very highly. He then tells the boy the story of how the gun came into his possession. The story is so vivid to the boy, that when his uncle leaves him to round up some bandits, and he is left alone in the cabin, he falls asleep and dreams the same story his uncle has just related to him, only HE is the hero.","popularity":0.1647,"poster_path":"/2qojqpeA7TNyjLWk8x85csvHvid.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of the Old Gun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Todd","original_name":"Harry Todd","popularity":0.1268,"profile_path":"/98T2jrTJCLo39PV7XOX2BBHzmff.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"John Purcell - Sheriff, Yuba County","credit_id":"61f86fd6dcf87500ed7396ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3353958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel P.
