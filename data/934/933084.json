Only by looking at oneself, Latvianness and the code of identity - in the lines and patterns of Latvian signs, an unimaginable power will be revealed. And one to one, two to four, tens to hundreds, and \"one\" will be \"we\" again.  \"To dress in Latvian signs\" (\"Latvju zīmēs rotāties\") is a special and unique event in the history of Latvian stage folk dance, because instead of the usual stadium or stage format, the signs are arranged in a digital environment, merging hundreds of dancers with tradition, animations and editing possibilities. Also, what has been unprecedented in the context of stage folk dance is the sound quality with which this performance offers to listen to 15 original compositions based on folk lyrics by Mārtiņš Miļevsks.","popularity":0.2805,"poster_path":"/nfz9Oj8AAXrChjRgkMtRe28Zgu6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2022-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"And one to one, two to four, tens to hundreds, and \"one\" will be \"we\" again.","title":"To dress in Latvian signs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3406231,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dagmāra Bārbale","original_name":"Dagmāra Bārbale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620d7dc2f3b49a004773a5d2","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3406231,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dagmāra Bārbale","original_name":"Dagmāra Bārbale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620d7db768b1ea006778caf3","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3406247,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Reinis Blūms","original_name":"Reinis Blūms","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620d7dfa71458f0043f9eca8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3406248,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Laura Leontjeva","original_name":"Laura Leontjeva","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f7eb9dcb80280045c2bbd0","department":"Sound","job":"Vocals"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3406232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reinis Suhanovs","original_name":"Reinis Suhanovs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/7CEIpfULSCnyTkSObn86lnQCrSw.jpg","credit_id":"61f7e9c2072166009995fdf5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937749,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mārtiņš Miļevskis","original_name":"Mārtiņš Miļevskis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f7eaf60c4c1601097b46a6","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872662,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kaspars Bārbals","original_name":"Kaspars Bārbals","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f7e9dd68929c0068abacda","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"LatvjuZimesRotaties","instagram_id":"latvjuzimesrotaties","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rNXg6I7ypZNfF4A5cezRloSdgZS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"lv","file_path":"/nfz9Oj8AAXrChjRgkMtRe28Zgu6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":638}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6382,"name":"folk music"},{"id":274230,"name":"latvian"},{"id":281402,"name":"folk dance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lv","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LATVJU ZĪMĒS ROTĀTIES - VEIDOŠANA - 3.DAĻA","key":"KapKJTgaxb0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-01-27T11:43:33.000Z","id":"61f7ec467a97ab00a963c977"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LATVJU ZĪMĒS ROTĀTIES - VEIDOŠANA - 2.DAĻA","key":"0vniCK5n37o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2022-01-27T11:41:40.000Z","id":"61f7ec3b59e8a90092528129"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LATVJU ZĪMĒS ROTĀTIES - VEIDOŠANA - 1.DAĻA","key":"4anH6jH7tSQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Bloopers","official":false,"published_at":"2022-01-27T11:39:06.000Z","id":"61f7ec2abb105700a0b1de77"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LATVJU ZĪMĒS ROTĀTIES - Official Trailer","key":"MPkJg9gzRXU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-01-27T08:12:34.000Z","id":"61f7ec117a97ab007325225f"}]}}}
