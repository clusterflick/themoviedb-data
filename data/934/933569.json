Grace is undecided whom she loves the best, John Hunter, a ranchman, or Kane, but finally decides to marry Kane. Some time later, we see Kane abusing his wife, neglecting her and always in a state of intoxication. Hunter has always been a friend of the family and it was nothing unusual to see him in their home, but Kane, entering the house one evening under the influence of liquor, misinterprets the meaning of Hunter's presence there, and upbraids his wife, slapping her in the face. Hunter is furious, but controls himself.","popularity":0.0978,"poster_path":"/dgzRGSVG8xZ84CLZozQqhg5TBIK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Gamblers' Way","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Stockdale","original_name":"Carl Stockdale","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":"/y642LERKLtOlqTjcckH8oWDVBGb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"John Hunter, a Ranchman","credit_id":"61f97584dfaae900455ac797","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"True Boardman","original_name":"True Boardman","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/lQCtb4xD1O6zBuW1LWNa9MaJNps.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jim Kane","credit_id":"61f9754d559d22006a06e6be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1031882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Selbie","original_name":"Evelyn Selbie","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/l75Ol7KP1ku0K8ErZ46qW7bjWag.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Louise Carew","credit_id":"61f9755c9e401200dd73b831","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3406433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reina Valdez","original_name":"Reina Valdez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Grace Carew","credit_id":"61f9756a397561004498e95b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Potel","original_name":"Victor Potel","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/obZCOU7xnxvlkLLfHtlZPs3EB3Q.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Bartender","credit_id":"61f9757a7a97ab011f9756ef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Todd","original_name":"Harry Todd","popularity":0.1268,"profile_path":"/98T2jrTJCLo39PV7XOX2BBHzmff.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61f9758cb7abb500e88b84a0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3059352,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Josephine Rector","original_name":"Josephine Rector","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/bjUKlju3hZO6O66EMYTF9Y0hcHW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"61f975946dc50700909d0155","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1023434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emory Johnson","original_name":"Emory Johnson","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/bhjxPzKIyVslP87KkDyDpUJoTks.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"61f9759d07216600e0122cf7","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Ingraham","original_name":"Lloyd Ingraham","popularity":0.1387,"profile_path":"/rt2FD3CxxiBDcyQAUvyb9P0OasY.jpg","credit_id":"61f9753339756100a3a5980d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0419763","wikidata_id":"Q13529936","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dgzRGSVG8xZ84CLZozQqhg5TBIK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
