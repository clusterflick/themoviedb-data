The camera roves with fierce curiosity amongst the Orange Order Parades, the raging 11th Night Bonfires of Belfast, the wall paintings of Londonderry, empty border-lands, murder-sites, cemeteries, home interiors, town and city streets whilst exploring how the troubles are both revealed and concealed by the Northern Irish landscape. Interviews with a mix of Northern Irish politicians, religious figures and victims of the troubles, including Rev. Ian Paisley and Bishop Emeritus of 'Derry Edward Daly, combine in a cinematic study of the complex effects of Northern Ireland's conflict history suspended in language.","popularity":0.283,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"New Zealander Alex Monteith’s open-ended, experimental documentary invites us to consider her images of a Northern Ireland ‘defined by the troubles’, and to listen to the eloquent voices of the troubled.","title":"Chapter and Verse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","title":"Chapter & Verse","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Attwood","original_name":"Alexander Attwood","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f8d91feee186009118d481","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Denyson","original_name":"Mark Denyson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f8d95d072166011b9bd908","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Emery","original_name":"Jim Emery","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f8d97159e8a9009253fde6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ervine","original_name":"David Ervine","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f8d9b0559d220043c8c076","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek Hussey","original_name":"Derek Hussey","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f8d9c9eee186490a17209a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie McHugh","original_name":"Charlie McHugh","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f8d9eaccb15f006aae418e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Paisley","original_name":"Ian Paisley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f8da80397561006cd2f3b5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Daly","original_name":"Edward Daly","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f8dab239756101125d9219","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Jarman","original_name":"Neil Jarman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f8dad439756101125d9239","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Walsh","original_name":"Margaret Walsh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61f8db245f2db100dc556410","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Monteith","original_name":"Alex Monteith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f8dbf270309f001c6407fc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407362,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeffery Holdaway","original_name":"Jeffery Holdaway","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f8dc09bb1057006daa8f3f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Monteith","original_name":"Alex Monteith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f8dba070309f00435d2b10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Monteith","original_name":"Alex Monteith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f8dbe2dfaae900455a5414","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5824,"name":"video surveillance"},{"id":7005,"name":"northern ireland"},{"id":11933,"name":"conflict"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"New Zealand International Film Festival","release_date":"2005-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Chapter and Verse 2005 04 Alex Monteith","key":"54004773","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2012-11-21T09:40:17.000Z","id":"61f8ea81028420001b7e5775"}]}}}
