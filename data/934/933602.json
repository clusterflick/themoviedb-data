We open on a self-assured and poetic guide, whose sculptural hair is adorned in constellations. With her invitation, we dive into four ecosystems that reside within her, each with distinct movement, casting, color and sound worlds exploring four forms of Black joy. We return to our guide one final time to find her transformed. Touching on the divinity of the body, sisterhood, and being, BLACK.ECO invites us to experience Black fantasy as a shiny vehicle for transcendence.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/osbmh3PYefd4EqRTE90cPGciomw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BLACK.ECO","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shauna Davis","original_name":"Shauna Davis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"65de51e924b3330185b7e06c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chani Bell","original_name":"Chani Bell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"61f9841f68929c00a4820513","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chawnta' Marie Van","original_name":"Chawnta' Marie Van","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"61f98429072166532c6a63cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emara Neymour-Jackson","original_name":"Emara Neymour-Jackson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"61f98433559d220043c955d9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Freeland, Jr.","original_name":"David Freeland, Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"61f9843cccb15f006aaecd50","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damontae Hack","original_name":"Damontae Hack","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"61f984459e40120044d873d1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derion Loman","original_name":"Derion Loman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"61f9844c9e401200dd73ce15","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shauna Davis","original_name":"Shauna Davis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f9839cdfaae900f5e097eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408155,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Bulbrook","original_name":"Anna Bulbrook","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f983c5fe6c1800688b3801","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408156,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nathan Kim","original_name":"Nathan Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f983d00c4c16009ba78cfa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408157,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Ryan Williams","original_name":"Chris Ryan Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f983e9397561006cd39361","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408158,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nina McNeely","original_name":"Nina McNeely","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f983f770309f00a0b8eac4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shauna Davis","original_name":"Shauna Davis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65de5202dcb6a3018586f711","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/osbmh3PYefd4EqRTE90cPGciomw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
