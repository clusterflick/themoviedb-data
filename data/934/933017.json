In a world turned upside down, peace and brutality walk side-by-side, while love and loyalty are sacrificed to the new order.  \"As the Beast Sleeps\" is set in Belfast's Protestant Rathcoole housing estate and explores with an up-to-the-minute urgency, the fragmentation within an extended family of loyalists in the context of the current cease-fire.","popularity":0.8441,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20639,"logo_path":"/qypOd6AlNrfHIXN9nArZmyMv6do.png","name":"BBC Northern
