This makes Craig popular at school and allows Brock to exact revenge upon his emasculating ex-girlfriend, but it also damages Craig's budding relationship with a girl he may really like. Luther, a homicidal 70s-style drug kingpin, wants the formula, and comes to get it at GrooveTaco, the play-within-the-movie, an homage to lesbian assassin hookers written by Craig's psuedo-freudian drama teacher.","popularity":0.0855,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luther’s Magic Weed","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norberto Briceno","original_name":"Norberto Briceno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Thug","credit_id":"61f7ee2adcf875008aca0c71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110712,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthew Brown","original_name":"Matthew Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bryn","credit_id":"61f7eea9072166001bd2ac45","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1759108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Browne","original_name":"Corey Browne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"DeMarcus","credit_id":"65c4fb0607faa20163c28c30","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elissa Dowling","original_name":"Elissa Dowling","popularity":0.223,"profile_path":"/1lv1Q9upYSm0tN1FvGrAq98zVMK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vanessa","credit_id":"61f7efddfe6c180068894a13","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3406261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ambrose Gibbs","original_name":"Ambrose Gibbs","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Luther","credit_id":"61f7f0157a97ab00a963cd48","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1111216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heather Gault","original_name":"Heather Gault","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Penny","credit_id":"61f7f05dcb802800ec04d599","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Snoopy Green","original_name":"Snoopy Green","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f7f08168929c00a47fd154","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1921006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
