Born and raised African-American speaking only English, he also belongs to the richly diverse West African country - Ghana. Attempting to reconnect with his terminally ill Grandfather (who he's named after), he realizes how out of place he is in a society that should be his inheritance. In one life changing taxi ride, we get to the root of his cultural displacement and why he feels he needs to establish a bond with his homeland and his people.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/59d2z6VNxEqsJ5prsgp1fOWF3ED.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GH","name":"Ghana"}],"release_date":"2020-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Twi","iso_639_1":"tw","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Like It Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2830486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amartei Armar","original_name":"Amartei Armar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f984afae2811006a649781","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1980,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/59d2z6VNxEqsJ5prsgp1fOWF3ED.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1320}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BlackStar Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
