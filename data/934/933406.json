An Australian expatriate, ex-Catholic, and ex-leftist radical with a penchant for speeding, espresso coffee, and four letter profanities, Robin Courtin hardly seems a likely candidate for a Buddabist nun.  And yet, since her conversion, Robina has traveled the globe, teaching her very unique brand of Buddhism to an international following of passionate devotees.","popularity":0.0776,"poster_path":"/hNaZfMKRwVBjDszBkgZP4z8QjK3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119150,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemedia","origin_country":""},{"id":2818,"logo_path":null,"name":"SBS Independent","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasing Buddha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2527977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robina Courtin","original_name":"Robina Courtin","popularity":0.0619,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Featured Subject","credit_id":"61f8c5467a97ab0073269d91","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amiel Courtin-Wilson","original_name":"Amiel Courtin-Wilson","popularity":0.1432,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c16874fdc14600ad551c4e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amiel Courtin-Wilson","original_name":"Amiel Courtin-Wilson","popularity":0.1432,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c16878871b34013b568c76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0260796","wikidata_id":"Q123287966","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1334,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hNaZfMKRwVBjDszBkgZP4z8QjK3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"2000 Sundance Film Festival","release_date":"2000-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
