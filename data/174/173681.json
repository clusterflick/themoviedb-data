For most, it means swimming pools, baseball, and beaches, but to a select few, to our people, the summer means only one thing...Outdoor Motocross.  All access was granted by the world's best riders. The TGO crew stepped inside their boots, showcasing their lives during the week and at the races. A first for the series is this intimate look at our MX heroes and their families as they attempt to take on the toughest sport out there.  In the 450 class, an unlikely champion was crowned. American hopefuls Mike Alessi, Andrew Short and Josh Grant faced off against the 2 time SX Champion, Australia's Chad Reed. Injuries, drama, and surprise performances turned the season upside down.  The 250's battled all summer long with an eclectic and world-class line up. As the season came down to the wire, Team Suzuki's Ryan Dungey and Pro Circuit's Christophe Pourcel traded blows respectively, only to end in heartache for one and triumph for the other.","popularity":0.3133,"poster_path":"/eCfyXhBEQ8ilFIPuEUkA2bVymo7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Outdoors: American Summer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Great Outdoors 2009: American Summer","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"TGO: American Summer","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"TGO 2009: American Summer","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"TGO 8: American Summer","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Alessi","original_name":"Mike Alessi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d39c3a36847f8255645","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":106262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Reed","original_name":"Chad Reed","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d39c3a36847f8255649","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Short","original_name":"Andrew Short","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d39c3a36847f825564d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Dungey","original_name":"Ryan Dungey","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d39c3a36847f8255659","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Pourcel","original_name":"Christophe Pourcel","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d39c3a36847f8255655","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Grant","original_name":"Josh Grant","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d39c3a36847f8255651","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Villopoto","original_name":"Ryan Villopoto","popularity":0.1076,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d39c3a36847f825565d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1149174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Troy Adamitis","original_name":"Troy Adamitis","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d39c3a36847f8255641","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eCfyXhBEQ8ilFIPuEUkA2bVymo7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10110,"name":"motocross"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TGO American Summer","key":"uWsqKo1HhU4","published_at":"2010-05-11T21:22:11.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec704c3a368544800a263"}]}}}
