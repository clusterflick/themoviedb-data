It is a straight-forward telling of the intermingled lives of a group of strangers doomed to die in a collapsing bridge accident. The Art Direction, paltry and unremarkable, surprisingly won an Oscar over the far more remarkable work nominated in THE IRON MASK. The special effect scene of the lovers plummeting with the bridge into the chasm is unforgettable and remarkably done.","popularity":0.7684,"poster_path":"/iiHIrhue0jDvcY4TMa0rUIuzjy9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bridge of San Luis Rey","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lili Damita","original_name":"Lili Damita","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/qxCID05o51oho6z5BUHH8EQoQzQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Camila (La Perichole)","credit_id":"52fe4d37c3a36847f8254e19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Torrence","original_name":"Ernest Torrence","popularity":0.1818,"profile_path":"/g1Fhsm1aVrhK4lAW8GUz9w9SzZz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Uncle Pio","credit_id":"52fe4d37c3a36847f8254e1d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raquel Torres","original_name":"Raquel Torres","popularity":0.1604,"profile_path":"/8Ek8ZeTMmLIvtYJJsHSkuRohTfV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Pepita","credit_id":"52fe4d37c3a36847f8254e21","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Alvarado","original_name":"Don Alvarado","popularity":0.1429,"profile_path":"/8ALQlPCzVEYjAz3nBlWYGV9UzhR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Manuel","credit_id":"52fe4d37c3a36847f8254e25","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duncan Renaldo","original_name":"Duncan Renaldo","popularity":0.2247,"profile_path":"/vusu8EXimaP9o79MH8QDHlnze9O.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Esteban","credit_id":"52fe4d37c3a36847f8254e29","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry B.
