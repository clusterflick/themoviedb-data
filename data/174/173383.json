Boots!","overview":"Musical comedy starring George Formby alongside his wife Beryl in his first ever feature film. George plays John Willie, the shoeshine boy at the upmarket Crestonian Hotel. He's a cheeky little man with no time for authority, a head full of dreams, a pocketful of songs and a heart full of love for the hotel's scullery maid (Beryl Formby). After causing more than his fair share of chaos at the hotel, he finally gets the chance to redeem himself - and show off his hidden musical talents - when he finds himself topping the bill at the hotel's Gala Cabaret Night. Songs include: 'Why Don't Women Like Me?', 'Sitting on the Ice in the Ice Rink' and 'I Could Make a Good Living at That'.","popularity":0.0925,"poster_path":"/siPekng426pLwwTkhfzna69PbLI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15596,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blakeley's Films (M/C) Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1934-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boots!
