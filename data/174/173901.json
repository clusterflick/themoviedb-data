Chen admires Wang, but Wang has fallen for Zhang's charm; Zhang fancies Li, whose heart is set on Chen ironically. The two young men seek to approach their objects of affection on the pretext of inviting the dream date of each other to an outing in the country during which they are teased and made fun of by the two women. To wipe away the shame, Wang and Li plot to intoxicate the women, who pretend to be in a drunken stupor while calling for help from their uncle and father respectively. In front of the elders, Chen declares her love for Wang, and Zhang for Li. Hit with the realisation of the women's sentiments, the two men reciprocate their respective admirers with their well-deserved love.","popularity":0.3768,"poster_path":"/jIjWkefqIaeRH1kzO2DkdXzEv2k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motion Picture & General Investment Co.,
