Among the highlights of the gig are a spunky rendition of Built For Comfort and the stirring, little-known composition Peace; its simplistic lyrics and heartfelt sentiments make it a bluesy first cousin to John Lennon's Give Peace A Chance. Interspersed with the great music are warm recollections from Dixon as he covers topics ranging from composing to his mid 1960s re-emergence in England via cover versions of his best material courtesy of The Rolling Stones and Cream (which featured long time admirer Eric Clapton).","popularity":0.1845,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":31580,"logo_path":null,"name":"Music Video Distributors","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"The blues are my heritage....and the blues are here to stay.\" - Willie Dixon","title":"Willie Dixon - I Am The Blues","video":true,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willie Dixon","original_name":"Willie Dixon","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Vocals, Stand-Up Bass","credit_id":"5471276c92514138130021b5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baby Doo Casten","original_name":"Baby Doo Casten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Vocals, Piano, Organ","credit_id":"5471277692514112e700627b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Watkins","original_name":"John Watkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"54712795c3a36830c4002130","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur \"Butch\" Dixon","original_name":"Arthur \"Butch\" Dixon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Piano","credit_id":"547127bdc3a36830c4002137","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carey Bell Harrington","original_name":"Carey Bell Harrington","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Chromatic Harmonica","credit_id":"547127e392514121f40002ec","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Morrison","original_name":"Mike Morrison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Electric Bass","credit_id":"54712802c3a3681286000213","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clifton James","original_name":"Clifton James","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"5471286fc3a3680e2200118d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388129,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Schwartz","original_name":"Robert Schwartz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"547128fd92514112ee00599f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":175506,"name":"blues music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
