However, seedy headmaster Dr. Jankers (music hall favourite Fred Emney) is in the toils of shady bookmaker Harry the Scar (boxer Freddie Mills) and has so-far kept his golden goose perched firmly at the bottom of the class. Blissfully unaware of nefarious intrigue around him, Cardew continues to flirt coyly with the French mistress and gamble for school dinners on the form room roulette wheel. But canny Scots solicitor McTavish has been sent to investigate... Featuring television's Billy Bunter, Gerald Campion, gorgeous Vera Day, Will Hay cohort Claude Hulbert, muddle-mouthed Stanley Unwin, a young Ronnie Corbett, and enough old jokes to fill a Christmas Cracker factory.","popularity":1.3394,"poster_path":"/pT1nrr4mTdq2KHKa9Jn80ZVedbn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43567,"logo_path":null,"name":"David Dent Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1955-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fun at St. Fanny's","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Emney","original_name":"Fred Emney","popularity":0.1953,"profile_path":"/d9B1QcQWlkVEcWRpoF34PiSna40.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dr. Septimus Jankers","credit_id":"52fe4d3ec3a36847f825666f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cardew Robinson","original_name":"Cardew Robinson","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/jV9esawCP4cs3HSCgoFxsSNGj0I.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cardew the Cad","credit_id":"59875306c3a3681c6500c4fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Karlin","original_name":"Miriam Karlin","popularity":0.1638,"profile_path":"/3VbYzKcHJdVYGkrBcqMgcKRmICE.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"'The Private Eye'","credit_id":"62bd78db097c490ba555ff15","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":107538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabrielle Brune","original_name":"Gabrielle Brune","popularity":0.0812,"profile_path":"/n9FFn3rLNcHR0I389WlCv2ViWR6.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"Matron","credit_id":"62bd78be229ae22291cd2c17","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Day","original_name":"Vera Day","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":"/rGim6s3eCaxiisp9rYeFYpVNVaQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maisie","credit_id":"52fe4d3ec3a36847f8256677","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aud Johansen","original_name":"Aud Johansen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":26,"character":"Mlle.
