In a period of three years they shot over 40 hours of New York Dolls footage. Now for the first time ever this footage is unveiled. This feature length documentary captures the band during early performances in New York at Kenny’s Castaways and Max’s Kansas City, then follows the Dolls on their tour of the West Coast, including footage from the Whisky A Go Go, the Real Don Steele Show, Rodney Bingenheimer’s E Club and much more. Intercut with revealing interviews, backstage banter and late night debauchery, this is THE definitive document of the New York Dolls.","popularity":0.502,"poster_path":"/vUIWtZqMWX3sKfSIXorwYgYikuS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Living dolls...","title":"New York Dolls: All Dolled Up","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Johansen","original_name":"David Johansen","popularity":0.3056,"profile_path":"/efK1QHpUbRqiMZNT5Is0m86qjE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a36847f82548e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvain Sylvain","original_name":"Sylvain Sylvain","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a36847f82548eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Thunders","original_name":"Johnny Thunders","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/6zeDWYf5W1Lby4kW9GhokZqEdz6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a36847f82548ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Kane","original_name":"Arthur Kane","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a36847f82548f3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Nolan","original_name":"Jerry Nolan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a36847f82548f7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Gruen","original_name":"Bob Gruen","popularity":0.1675,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a36847f82548fb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadya Beck","original_name":"Nadya Beck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a36847f82548ff","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadya Beck","original_name":"Nadya Beck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570acc109251417da7000b84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Gruen","original_name":"Bob Gruen","popularity":0.1675,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570acc2d92514155ed000ebb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1153033","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2743,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vUIWtZqMWX3sKfSIXorwYgYikuS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1829},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m5E9V3o17BkUHXrCvnrIupt6FGg.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7AkbzcwUHk5vKcV8J4mTMdBJXPd.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":10610,"name":"live"},{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":33973,"name":"glam rock"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
