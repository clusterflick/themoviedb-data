Komrade Irina and Komrade Ivan Ivanovich arrive from Transylvania, bringing with them the \"dead\" Count Dracula to be placed on display. After hearing the Killer Barbies, however, Dracula awakens, falls in love with Silvia (who looks like Charo on a bad hair day), and decides to make her his own. Realizing that they have a vampire on their hands, park owners Pepe Morgan and Martin Fierro call in the world famous, blind vampire hunter, Dr Seward. While Seward tries to track Dracula with his nose, Dracula manages to knock off a few cast members -- a faux Dracula, Bela, an acrobot with orange hair, and both Komrades Ivan and Irina. When Dracula tries to bite Silvia during a performance, Dr Seward decides to use Silvia as bait. He sends her out walking alone. When Dracula follows, they pursue and stake him. Dracula metamorphs into a white rabbit and hops away.","popularity":0.6326,"poster_path":"/wGwH5aYrp8ykfyiiLGrVAUcyJEN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Impacto Films","origin_country":""},{"id":6910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quiet Village Filmkunst","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2002-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Kiss me, Vampire!","title":"Killer Barbys vs. Dracula","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":563848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvia Superstar","original_name":"Silvia Superstar","popularity":0.1398,"profile_path":"/exIx38nBPFl8FIG2UofAQ2Kf435.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Silvia","credit_id":"52fe4d3cc3a36847f8256115","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":186397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrique Sarasola","original_name":"Enrique Sarasola","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Count Dracula","credit_id":"52fe4d3cc3a36847f8256119","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":101472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lina Romay","original_name":"Lina Romay","popularity":14.779,"profile_path":"/ac2RgHkvJ1MM8Z5jI1y8CSMOZZR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Irina von Karstein","credit_id":"52fe4d3cc3a36847f825611d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aldo Sambrell","original_name":"Aldo Sambrell","popularity":0.3727,"profile_path":"/lJsoZtOeNaer5jZSydSjONL32xp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pepe Morgan","credit_id":"52fe4d3cc3a36847f8256121","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan van Husen","original_name":"Dan van Husen","popularity":0.1632,"profile_path":"/9mrSfDIZT8M77FVmKu4PA6mJaFL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dr. Seward","credit_id":"52fe4d3cc3a36847f8256125","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bela B.","original_name":"Bela B.","popularity":0.3305,"profile_path":"/hSeyOuRSJoNVfmVpEyQjoR6mqGY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bela Blasko Lugosi","credit_id":"52fe4d3cc3a36847f8256129","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":101588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carsten Frank","original_name":"Carsten Frank","popularity":2.796,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Albinus","credit_id":"52fe4d3cc3a36847f825612d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy King","original_name":"Billy King","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"52fe4d3cc3a36847f8256131","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":102139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katja Bienert","original_name":"Katja Bienert","popularity":0.36,"profile_path":"/vMXLpzJY8g4rjw0Jvgyxkmp4Tm4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Katja van Barenboim","credit_id":"52fe4d3cc3a36847f8256135","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pietro Martellanza","original_name":"Pietro Martellanza","popularity":0.1335,"profile_path":"/n0JK5BKsHR50ml9z5toToSSd8I4.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"False Dracula","credit_id":"52fe4d3cc3a36847f8256139","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Ibarra","original_name":"Sandra Ibarra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Selena","credit_id":"52fe4d3cc3a36847f825613d","order":10},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":100302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fata Morgana","original_name":"Fata Morgana","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Puri","credit_id":"52fe4d3dc3a36847f8256141","order":11},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1107804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Montes","original_name":"Carmen Montes","popularity":1.697,"profile_path":"/yOEkcUFJqWczbIp9SqbfiX6Ck9d.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Carmen","credit_id":"52fe4d3dc3a36847f8256145","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Lapidus","original_name":"Paul Lapidus","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Martin Fierro","credit_id":"52fe4d3dc3a36847f8256149","order":13},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":100301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Seastrom","original_name":"Viktor Seastrom","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Ivan Ivanovich","credit_id":"52fe4d3dc3a36847f825614d","order":14},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1156698,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"José Roberto Vila","original_name":"José Roberto Vila","popularity":1.851,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Inspector (as J.R.
