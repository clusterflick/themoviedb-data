In true farcical style, the magistrate too ends up at the music hall, and before long all the characters are trying not to avoid each other... Mainly notable (a) because of its depiction of the music hall as seen by a generation which knew it intimately (b) because of its use of music hall acts of the time and (c) because it gave Will Hay his first film role.","popularity":0.8257,"poster_path":"/cGukeGyaASibHi7Fy6pX6qY7yHu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":305,"logo_path":null,"name":"British International Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1934-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Were the Days","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Hay","original_name":"Will Hay","popularity":0.2205,"profile_path":"/6dQ6oCFt4UeXVsOiOswFmWevgIg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Magistrate Brutus Poskett","credit_id":"52fe4d2dc3a36847f8252c77","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":975949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iris Hoey","original_name":"Iris Hoey","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":"/2PbJ7ooPmtpq2Ed3cOfiV6fs4VU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Agatha Poskett","credit_id":"52fe4d2dc3a36847f8252c7b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Baddeley","original_name":"Angela Baddeley","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Charlotte Verrinder","credit_id":"52fe4d2dc3a36847f8252c7f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claud Allister","original_name":"Claud Allister","popularity":0.2048,"profile_path":"/hd4cj6X8VZj1XSOYjn6WXeekRI9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Capt.
