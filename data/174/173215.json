These young men are called gold farmers in the online games, and the in-game goods they produce are sold for real dollar to American gamers who need a short cut to success in the games. In this documentary, gold farmers describe how it feels to live at the border between the virtual and real, to mix play and work, and to interact with foreign gamers who they would never have the chance to meet if not for this globalized virtual world. We also hear conflicting views from various American gamers who are affected by this particular entanglement of the virtual and the real.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gold Farmers","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1155990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gin Je","original_name":"Gin Je","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d2ec3a36847f82530d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1743932","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
