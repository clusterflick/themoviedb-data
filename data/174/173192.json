Locked away in Texas prisons for a quarter century, he has years to ponder questions of justice and innocence, truth and fate. Though he is virtually invisible to society, a team of dedicated attorneys spends years fighting for the right to test DNA evidence found at the murder scene. Their discoveries ultimately reveal that the price of a wrongful conviction goes well beyond one man’s loss of freedom.","popularity":0.311,"poster_path":"/tuuse3PuibyIwDUx6xeoZRa4GbZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Bandana Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Truth Matters.","title":"An Unreal Dream: The Michael Morton Story","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Michael Morton Story: An Unreal Dream","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1746395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Morton","original_name":"Michael Morton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"588c2587c3a3687839003f21","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7854,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Al Reinert","original_name":"Al Reinert","popularity":0.1623,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d2ec3a36847f8252fcd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58049,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Levie Isaacks","original_name":"Levie Isaacks","popularity":0.1682,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d2ec3a36847f8252fd3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3315849,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Dean","original_name":"John Dean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619ad19abe7f350043c38bf0","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2555202","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8iqPNg0tpDe1812tzKV9VN1CExw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tuuse3PuibyIwDUx6xeoZRa4GbZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6139,"name":"innocence"},{"id":9826,"name":"murder"},{"id":10714,"name":"serial killer"},{"id":161188,"name":"austin, texas"},{"id":182711,"name":"dna testing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
