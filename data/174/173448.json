Although Munro dispatches a letter urging them to take refuge at Fort Edward until the road is safe, an Iroquois scout intercepts the warning. So Major Duncan Hayward is unaware of the danger as he escorts Alice Munro, her sister Cora, and her young brother Davy from the sanctuary of the fort. When their guide Magua, a vengeful Iroquois played by Buster Crabbe, betrays them, only one man can save the travelers from his savage trap.","popularity":0.5623,"poster_path":"/eseO5LhfaN5DR3xe5kSIuOvW3zc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":121016,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sam Katzman Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"TEMPTATION IN THE WILDERNESS!","title":"Last of the Redmen","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le Dernier des Peaux Rouges","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Last of the Redskins","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Hall","original_name":"Jon Hall","popularity":0.1534,"profile_path":"/yNrYXKw5gxY4fRbXmwoUNUY6uX8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Major Heywood","credit_id":"52fe4d33c3a36847f8254193","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael O'Shea","original_name":"Michael O'Shea","popularity":0.1142,"profile_path":"/6ObslaW4FasbSlhvMqITDVL8Foq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hawk-Eye / Natty Bumpo","credit_id":"52fe4d33c3a36847f8254197","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Ankers","original_name":"Evelyn Ankers","popularity":0.4353,"profile_path":"/yJYhqiYRD4HGhDLjzFr9bdYGW23.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alice Munro","credit_id":"52fe4d33c3a36847f825419b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Bishop","original_name":"Julie Bishop","popularity":0.1635,"profile_path":"/e0PQwkBiHBcjaLaoYIZry7bn3xA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cora Munro","credit_id":"52fe4d33c3a36847f825419f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buster Crabbe","original_name":"Buster Crabbe","popularity":0.4029,"profile_path":"/1spocNgJFavXTuXXTu1PvRf3A5d.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Magua","credit_id":"52fe4d33c3a36847f82541a3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert \"Buzz\" Henry","original_name":"Robert \"Buzz\" Henry","popularity":0.1081,"profile_path":"/9Ij9hKwvNMkZElSFEoPv4lKv5HM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Davy Munro","credit_id":"52fe4d33c3a36847f82541a7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Vallin","original_name":"Rick Vallin","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":"/7dMOEKv7uTCH6GzjCZbrod1h7qr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Uncas","credit_id":"52fe4d33c3a36847f82541ab","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Worlock","original_name":"Frederick Worlock","popularity":0.1434,"profile_path":"/8i21iKKMvqDxxqzYT1MW06FOAJ4.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Gen.
