New Orleans is the setting for Getting Back to Abnormal, a film that serves up a provocative mix of race, corruption and politics to tell the story of the re-election campaign of Stacy Head, a white woman in a city council seat traditionally held by a black representative. Supported by her irrepressible African-American aide Barbara Lacen-Keller, Head polarizes the city as her candidacy threatens to diminish the power and influence of its black citizens. Featuring a cast of characters as colorful as the city itself, the film presents a New Orleans that outsiders rarely see.","popularity":0.3181,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Getting Back to Abnormal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Odabashian","original_name":"Peter Odabashian","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d30c3a36847f82536cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Kolker","original_name":"Andy Kolker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d30c3a36847f82536c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":209975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Stekler","original_name":"Paul Stekler","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d30c3a36847f82536d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1110926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Alvarez","original_name":"Louis Alvarez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d30c3a36847f82536c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2452236","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South by Southwest Film Festival","release_date":"2013-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS, POV","release_date":"2014-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Getting Back to Abnormal - Trailer","key":"oVqMgf0NzU4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-10-11T23:24:49.000Z","id":"5e1916413679a10013941cd7"}]}}}
