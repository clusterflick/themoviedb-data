A posibility. Speculative technology, time machine prototypes. Repetition. Change, transformation of forms and potential forms to happen.  One tortilla is never the same as another and is always the same. Contingency machine. Technology, which dreams of the great primal comal, seriality and uniqueness.  Anahuac against robots. An invisible war takes place, it is a confrontation of magical order. It is the signs and their repetition that produce time and its symptoms.  mystical materialism.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La máquina del futuro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Varela","original_name":"Bruno Varela","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657ca86e63e6fb013b4635ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
