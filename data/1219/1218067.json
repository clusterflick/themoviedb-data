Now Mumbo is forced out on a challenging journey in order to encounter an unpredictable witch. Luckily Mumbo's best friends join him. It’s still an insurmountable task, but at least the friends are facing it together. It is not easy being a small hippo, nor a giant one, and when the only way back to normal depends on the cooperation of a frank and mischievous witch, anyone can imagine that it requires a true effort. Hopefully Mumbo Jumbo will develop a strong belief in himself during the adventure. Otherwise, it will definitely be an impossible mission.","popularity":0.1685,"poster_path":"/xViXnOy9pMBlZQbEdL926mCpF0N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3922,"logo_path":"/uXDOnG25HLnban0UfpRVjxASMWW.png","name":"A.
