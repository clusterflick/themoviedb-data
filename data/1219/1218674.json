She didn't talk much - certainly not about what moved her. It is only after her death that I use this film to search for how war and violence affect relationships and create silence. In everyday life, in the household and in the family. Digging out, looking for continuities, creating continuities lies this film’s soul. A tender portrait that takes us back to a time, which still resonates with us today.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/eq566QGOVLjI0SX49zg46A0cSyc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":296,"logo_path":"/oPCnyumoJtIedjQoQin6zSSHkv8.png","name":"Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Feel Your Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4433277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Heinig","original_name":"Laura Heinig","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657dabfdfd140b076b8242e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2965812,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jochen Wolkersdorfer","original_name":"Jochen Wolkersdorfer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2c4d13ff2df0163406459","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3076788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Schares","original_name":"Simon Schares","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2c479873f000162f532a5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Fritz","original_name":"Daniel Fritz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2c4bb873f0000c8f530ea","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2622815,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frederic Hellmann","original_name":"Frederic Hellmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2c4c7db952d0148dacb2b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4433277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Heinig","original_name":"Laura Heinig","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2c4833ff2df017c40637c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4386630,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paula Meier","original_name":"Paula Meier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2c48bdb952d0183dacc62","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4433277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Heinig","original_name":"Laura Heinig","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2c4df873f0000c8f530f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2622815,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frederic Hellmann","original_name":"Frederic Hellmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2c495ce4ddc014a8abc51","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4500124,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Laura Heining","original_name":"Laura Heining","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2c46a96386401640ed7fc","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eq566QGOVLjI0SX49zg46A0cSyc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Analogica Selection","release_date":"2023-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
