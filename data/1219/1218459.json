The recital project revolved around three Pieces for three soloists by Helmut Lachenmann, a nucleus that manifests itself as an index of radicalism from which a story of the direction that guides the career of its author can be undertaken.  The program concluded with the simultaneous performance of those three Pieces, a version that appears in the Lachenmanian catalog under the name of Montage and for which there is no score or record. What is heard at the conclusion of this documentary could be the only record, so far, of that ghost version that the composer advises not to try.","popularity":0.249,"poster_path":"/zie6l0kKWfV30q1K4T9OPQPhXD0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20124,"logo_path":"/uyKNacxTuJItGNZoqMzPtKtZBLn.png","name":"El Pampero Cine","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":226186,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciclo de Conciertos de Música Contemporánea","origin_country":""},{"id":107848,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fundación PROA","origin_country":""},{"id":226187,"logo_path":null,"name":"Complejo Teatral de Buenos Aires","origin_country":""},{"id":226188,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tenaris","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2015-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Montage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarita Fernández","original_name":"Margarita Fernández","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Margarita Fernández","credit_id":"657cebfa60c75104ef76fb14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helmut Lachenmann","original_name":"Helmut Lachenmann","popularity":0.0619,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Helmut Lachenmann","credit_id":"657cec707ad08c051f4f75e0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4432380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Dillon","original_name":"Francesco Dillon","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"657cec7f0816c7053208cb4e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4432381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Federico Landaburu","original_name":"Federico Landaburu","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"657cec8dc9054f049eb4d950","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejo Moguillansky","original_name":"Alejo Moguillansky","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":"/e3Rgu4bdkeK4KkbwmcMrRu8Jo3W.jpg","credit_id":"657cece05f2db10509dd94b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2958384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helmut Lachenmann","original_name":"Helmut Lachenmann","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657cecfd0816c704ea08ced1","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejo Moguillansky","original_name":"Alejo Moguillansky","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":"/e3Rgu4bdkeK4KkbwmcMrRu8Jo3W.jpg","credit_id":"657cecf10816c704ea08ceba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1027,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zie6l0kKWfV30q1K4T9OPQPhXD0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":684}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
