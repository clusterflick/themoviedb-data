None of the local children her age can read yet, so to impress them she boasts that she can read, but this is a lie. When the children find a bottle containing a map and a mysterious message, they look to Rouxelle to translate it for them. In a panic, she guesses the meaning, and says it will lead them to find treasure. But as they go exploring and end up separated and in danger, they find out Rouxelle wasn’t telling the truth.","popularity":0.0657,"poster_path":"/8WpLaUocQxi0MTKkmEt5diB7G8Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12189,"logo_path":"/1ictacTW028ZDtea9GqYWnIR8aJ.png","name":"La Boîte, ...
