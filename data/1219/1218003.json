Labeled a degenerate artist, Pablo Picasso takes refuge in Royan, where Maya, his daughter, and Marie-Thérèse Walter, his companion, are staying. He is accompanied by his secretary Jaime Sabartes and also by the captivating Dora Maar. Within this setting of peace and light, surrounded by friends and family, Picasso is soon seduced by this laid-back lifestyle. This apparent tranquility is perhaps only a false pretense... In the privacy of his studio, the artist is visited by monsters, reminding him of the threat of imminent danger. Confronted with dark forces, the artist cannot escape forever and has to face his truth and the truth of the world.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/22atsjcRlYaXKaAhYQfKKe18YFT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130160,"logo_path":"/4ZSZjnqP69Q038EtLBgxvxpkPGt.png","name":"Les Films du poisson rouge","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":216076,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imagic TV","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Picasso in Royan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2558167,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Estèves","original_name":"Catherine Estèves","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b76407ecd280101d33e6a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2558166,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jordi B.
