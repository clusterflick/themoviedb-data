Kuba and his 3.5-year-old daughter Emilia crash land on a desert planet. While Emilia explores the new world, Kuba tries to repair the rocket listening to the noises from the space, including hypnotic sounds of a black hole. In a parallel, realistic thread, we meet Jagoda, Kuba's partner and Emilia's mother, who suddenly ends up in hospital. Through the messages exchanged with her close ones, we follow the story of her battle with an illness. Meanwhile, on the planet, Emilia discovers life - a land of fantastic flowers. When a black hole comes close to the planet, Emilia rescues Kuba by taking him to a fairy-tale world of a child’s drawings.","popularity":0.0564,"poster_path":"/qEZQZsRuHOMAOMCNUhnpgrhNsiW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86773,"logo_path":"/lbjAsmIuOcIEFJG2WRSz1NUAXvi.png","name":"Madants","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":114433,"logo_path":null,"name":"Letko","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Pale Pink","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2016989,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Piotr Szczepanowicz","original_name":"Piotr Szczepanowicz","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b74978e2ba60138b890b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761368,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beata Rzeźniczek","original_name":"Beata Rzeźniczek","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b7481a1d33229e3a96f90","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2085075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kuba Mikurda","original_name":"Kuba Mikurda","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/kVhmTKGxwgrVDPYYLxsGyOAoH8E.jpg","credit_id":"657b747b176a9400e130b234","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/45tPnTadhLfxfkxgdN3zw9XCH1A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qEZQZsRuHOMAOMCNUhnpgrhNsiW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
