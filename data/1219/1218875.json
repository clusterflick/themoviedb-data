This observational documentary film portrays mind-crippling Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and shows its devastating effect on families and family life. For Hugh every day is a battle against every object in his house because every single piece has a particular place where it must be placed, oriented precisely according to Hugh's OCD condition. From the bacon in the fridge to the socks in his chest of drawers, the ornaments on the mantelshelf, even the sound a door's magnetic latch makes and the position of the dog's water bowl are the cause of consternation to Hugh who must have everything exactly right.","popularity":0.302,"poster_path":"/4t2ZKHASoCF5tKZeES1qdK4E43X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Is Obsessed With The Number 12","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Carter","original_name":"Jim Carter","popularity":0.6746,"profile_path":"/okiL3gc0mNqP0kPfMQHHvFjKnHb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"657e6c2a904f6d07097f590e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4434197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Turner","original_name":"Hugh Turner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"657e6cfe48333a25b2cb05d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4434195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Veale","original_name":"David Veale","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"657e6ce0394a870877731c58","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2779629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Everson","original_name":"Simon Everson","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657e6b93394a87082f7357e4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2750194,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marc Davies","original_name":"Marc Davies","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657e6dfb8f26bc23d7751b04","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2779629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Everson","original_name":"Simon Everson","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657e6b8859008607eab1e1d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2384477","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4t2ZKHASoCF5tKZeES1qdK4E43X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
