Have to Endure It, which draws attention to sexual harassment and abuse of power in Czech art schools.  For years, the rampant sexism and bullying that exist behind the walls of many Czech universities have escaped media attention. In 2021, Marie-Luisa Purkrábková decided to speak out about toxic university relationships. She invited her DAMU (Faculty of Performing Arts) classmates to do the same. As the co-founder of the feminist initiative You Don't! Have to Endure It, she has become the voice of a humiliated student body for many. In this documentary, she shares the joy of her small successes as well as her doubts regarding how long she can face the pressure of such a responsible role. Scenes from her private life and public appearances create a portrait of a woman who clearly understands that even when pushing for far-reaching changes, one cannot afford to ignore one’s own health.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/lnYKu0AeR48qxylA2i7ObrrC0DB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2023-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After the Silence Was Broken","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3281600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikoláš Arsenjev","original_name":"Mikoláš Arsenjev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b7cff7a3c5200ca7b1859","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3281600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikoláš Arsenjev","original_name":"Mikoláš Arsenjev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a69cbdf74f5f012b69002b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3281600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikoláš Arsenjev","original_name":"Mikoláš Arsenjev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a69cc39bcd0f012eba9234","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4484269,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Klára Davydova","original_name":"Klára Davydova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a69cdb97a4e601314f85ce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3281600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikoláš Arsenjev","original_name":"Mikoláš Arsenjev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a69cf89bcd0f012eba9247","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2705480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Belova","original_name":"Anna Belova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a69d0a97a4e601314f85d8","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3504364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliška Kerbachová","original_name":"Eliška Kerbachová","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a69d17c525c4012bf8d6c9","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27030736","wikidata_id":"Q116995894","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1654,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/lnYKu0AeR48qxylA2i7ObrrC0DB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1169}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"One World Festival","release_date":"2023-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
