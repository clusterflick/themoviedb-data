He has always been supported by the people in his close circle. However, he has never met someone with the same condition, someone who also goes through this mental seesaw.  We will meet a young magician and the mother of a boy with OCD, all touched by the same condition and its various faces. Edgar will seek answers to questions that constantly haunt his mind, such as: How on earth have they been able to understand their minds? How have they overcome the various obstacles? And if they have overcome them at all.","popularity":0.0872,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beast with a Thousand Faces","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4433904,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edgar Barrera","original_name":"Edgar Barrera","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657e34fd394a87080b730c97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4433904,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edgar Barrera","original_name":"Edgar Barrera","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657e350e8f26bc191475178e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4433904,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edgar Barrera","original_name":"Edgar Barrera","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657e351b904f6d07097f0e13","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4433907,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mar Canet","original_name":"Mar Canet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657e3528124c8d072d38a986","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f2HEec5TIoTQZr1pJoa5nckkJ9j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":159315,"name":"mental health"},{"id":162735,"name":"disability"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
