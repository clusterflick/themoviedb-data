They needed pilots - young guys who had everything to prove and nothing to lose. And all this to honor the promise of faster mail. Jean Mermoz, a young ex-Air Force officer, proves to be the best pioneer of the skies. Against nature and against mechanics, he always delivers mail to its destination. Captivated by his conquests and prodigies, he sees only the success of the airline: Faster. Further. The dawn of progress. But a few years later, with many pilots now dead and the world still reeling from the 1930s Wall Street Crash, l'Aéropostale is at the brink of bankruptcy. Mermoz is forced to question the true meaning of his idealism.","popularity":0.0492,"poster_path":"/uYyJEd4CrdIGRARHMyFLiVXJYab.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":216091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eddy Cinéma","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Line","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833980,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicolas de Rosanbo","original_name":"Nicolas de Rosanbo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b948ca1d33229e3a97584","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2945577,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Franck Salomé","original_name":"Franck Salomé","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b9483564ec7011b218d6b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4430566,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stéphane Arteta","original_name":"Stéphane Arteta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b947b63e6fb00e3cda9c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uYyJEd4CrdIGRARHMyFLiVXJYab.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
