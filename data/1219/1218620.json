Impermanence, death, loss, grief, surrender and resurrection are the narrative elements of the story. The chorus cries to the universe of the endless cycle of birth and death. In the midst of this, glimpses of ordinary life are revealed. Within the endless pursuit of leisure and pleasure, suffering is ever present. The greater the pursuit of pleasure, the greater the agony of dissatisfaction and loneliness. The illusion of pleasure always shatters, breaking the veil of life wasted and lost.  The poem ends in the collision of the two worlds, embracing the wisdom of impermanence.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Still Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3446987,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victoria Imperioli","original_name":"Victoria Imperioli","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657d65c2cb6db50723054f8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
