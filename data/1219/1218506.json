Joyce has embarked on his great enterprise, the composition of Ulysses. After a night on the town, he sits at his writing desk, working on his masterpiece. As he begins to write, he is visited by two ghosts, Homer and Penelope, who have a thing or two to say to him and to each other. As morning approaches, Joyce composes a letter to his aunt, inquiring after everyday Dublin life, details of which will become the thread of his iconic masterwork. Meanwhile, Nora pines for home, longing to return to her beloved west of Ireland.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/krV466EH66UgonbSVN6vuAcRzpo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Ghosts - Irish National Opera & ANU","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4432689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jade Phoenix","original_name":"Jade Phoenix","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nora","credit_id":"657d335d60c75107187736f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3207765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doreen Curran","original_name":"Doreen Curran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Penelope","credit_id":"657d338c1da7a607502a3044","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Gaunt","original_name":"William Gaunt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Homer","credit_id":"657d48687ad08c06794fccc0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4432791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Bowen","original_name":"Christopher Bowen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Joyce","credit_id":"657d48b31da7a607502a3d88","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4432691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Lowe","original_name":"Louise Lowe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657d33a9fd140b078781f8fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3207769,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Evangelia Rigaki","original_name":"Evangelia Rigaki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657d33bfc9054f06ccb51a74","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2945,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/krV466EH66UgonbSVN6vuAcRzpo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1963}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
