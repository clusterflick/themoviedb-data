Jacques does not suffer from loneliness because, since childhood, he has had a unique ability: he can communicate with objects! Jacques discovers that a radical scientist despises humanity and its materialism to the extent of exterminating all forms of life outside of plants and insects. Forced to take a stand for humans, Jacques allies himself with a fierce orphan, a rebellious runaway, and a woman fighting for her independence. In this urban odyssey, they initiate the awakening of a new society: reuse objects and respecting all living beings.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":"/bBwpIh6DEbarjfZaeEazf8TlYHO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":216089,"logo_path":null,"name":"Squarefish","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Flying Man's Prophecy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4430546,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Valentin Gregoire","original_name":"Valentin Gregoire","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b8d267ecd2800ad2449ee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Kesteloot","original_name":"Vincent Kesteloot","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b8cd57ecd28011ef2698f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Kesteloot","original_name":"Vincent Kesteloot","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b8cd0564ec70138bde4cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4430545,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julien Lambert","original_name":"Julien Lambert","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b8d0e63e6fb00e3cda8ad","department":"Writing","job":"Graphic Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1754,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bBwpIh6DEbarjfZaeEazf8TlYHO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1240}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
