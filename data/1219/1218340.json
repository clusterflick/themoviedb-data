Stan hires a psychotherapist Dr Franz. She is supposed to support Stan's actors and ensure that the production runs smoothly. Stan notices that she gets the team and the actors hooked on the drug Zyprecs in an effort to delude them into painting the pharmaceutical industry in a good light. The actors gradually begin to suffer a nervous breakdown from the side effects of the medication, but the premiere is getting closer and closer. As a medical consultant, Dr Franz intervenes ever more deeply in the production process and artistic work.","popularity":0.3636,"poster_path":"/bDgTOhcZavMLRw2wKMNvNVMAUCb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Immerhin: Die Kunst, die Kunst","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1302130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharina Bellena","original_name":"Katharina Bellena","popularity":0.1387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kristine Franz","credit_id":"657c7c02ec8a4300fd7fab9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armin Marewski","original_name":"Armin Marewski","popularity":0.1461,"profile_path":"/tDTqOOPAqLAomNKCQoYPIvs6MFE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Stan","credit_id":"657c7c0c7ecd28013b3f241e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1728573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Schwarz","original_name":"Sylvia Schwarz","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":"/6EjCDtHDek51pIGxiaFn0DsLxgB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tamara Weinberg","credit_id":"657c7c18ec8a4300aa6e3471","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3241397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melanie Stahl","original_name":"Melanie Stahl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Eleonore","credit_id":"657c7c217ecd2800c70d8cf4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2680623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Horacek","original_name":"Eva Horacek","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jennifer","credit_id":"657c7c2bba131b00e4378604","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2562710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Berg","original_name":"Andreas Berg","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Dr. Braun","credit_id":"657c7c57ea394900c4fff32d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2409407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Hiemer","original_name":"Julia Hiemer","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/i5OrG5UK94h9dDQqKnIh29lr6Ao.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Karin","credit_id":"657c7c5eec8a4300fd7fabc5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1395596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Llewellyn Reichman","original_name":"Llewellyn Reichman","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/6PuRhJC7xJaAJzOe322sHZ94rnv.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Jolka","credit_id":"676e96a82c9097b266615b45","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5143384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Münch","original_name":"Jennifer Münch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Schauspielerin","credit_id":"676e96bd2c9097b266615b73","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707296,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Antonia Walther","original_name":"Antonia Walther","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657c7be4176a9417340147c9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707296,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Antonia Walther","original_name":"Antonia Walther","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657c7bc9564ec7011b21ea13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871788,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anselm Belser","original_name":"Anselm Belser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657c7bf47ecd2800e46d97d5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15107844","wikidata_id":"Q123861923","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1410,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sojb7hAt0rBTLNArO1MxCCFMz5L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2509},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bgcWibFGZnOuZS1KxOZ3mCloZzB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2849}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/bDgTOhcZavMLRw2wKMNvNVMAUCb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
