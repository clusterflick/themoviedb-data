Regina, a Zionist who moved from New York to Israel in her 20s, has been a liberal her entire life. Nathan, on the other hand, left a very religious household in Jerusalem and leans to the right in his political views. When the latest conflict between Israel and Hamas starts to escalate, so does the tension between the couple. Filmed in the comfort of their apartment, Regina and Nathanâ€™s arguments and intense dynamics unveil the frustration and hopelessness of the vast majority of Israelis, who have come to accept these wars as part of their everyday reality.","popularity":0.2803,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fine Lines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4239895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amit Lerner","original_name":"Amit Lerner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657d508560c7510701774f19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
