A profound silence engulfs the mind, stifling even the breath. It is the rediscovery of a lost emotion—'awe,' flowing like a stream. A mother, mourning the loss of her only son, embarks on a daily ritual of mountain hikes. In the ascent, she seeks solace amidst the sacred silence that nature provides. For her, the journey becomes a poignant exploration of the profound and the mundane. A 70-year-old haenyeo (traditional female diver), wise from a life intertwined with the sea, asserts that materiality is both our everyday reality and our path to paradise. Their lives, like the ebb and flow of water, find meaning in the continuous stream. Following the currents, one discovers mountains beneath the sea, whereas within the mountains, the sea continues to flow. Ultimately, the boundaries of the world are revealed to be nonexistent, echoing the profound interconnectedness of all things.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":"/8Tj94pKQjlZxMJU7ZIUsdZdzCQz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7819,"logo_path":"/ghFZAt4edln0M7BzDExyYMzUGX1.png","name":"Lotte Entertainment","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary","title":"No Boundaries","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2297269,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jin Jae-un","original_name":"Jin Jae-un","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657d4bd95f2db106b6ddc260","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1282,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Tj94pKQjlZxMJU7ZIUsdZdzCQz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"무경계(No Boundaries, 2023) 메인 예고편 [한반도 국립공원 다큐 영화][2023-11-30 개봉]","key":"aC6D3N0Qr0M","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-11-15T04:05:37.000Z","id":"657d4d05cb6db50760053396"}]}}}
