Melomaniac introduces Aadam Jacobs and his archive of recordings while exploring his impact as a Chicago music scene staple in the 80s and 90s. Interviews with the owners of longstanding Chicago venues including The Metro and the former Lounge Ax lend perspective to Aadam's character and the music scene. Conversations with Chicago artists give the 80s/90s scene a voice through interviews that include local music icon Jon Langford and comedian Fred Armisen. The film looks forward to the vital need to preserve the historically important music legacy Aadam will someday leave behind while highlighting its importance now.","popularity":0.3414,"poster_path":"/Ap7oyYGmR3Coe0UViSywxkDY1Mj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The archive that Chicago never expected, recorded by the guy who was always there.","title":"Melomaniac","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4432201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aadam Jacobs","original_name":"Aadam Jacobs","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"657cc8f4ba131b00c748fd40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Armisen","original_name":"Fred Armisen","popularity":1.1901,"profile_path":"/nLMCRlt0MV2uu4KPbDPDNsPWfBG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"657cc90e63e6fb00e3ce07b9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4432203,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katlin Schneider","original_name":"Katlin Schneider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657cc944e22d28011fd1442a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4432203,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katlin Schneider","original_name":"Katlin Schneider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657cc935e93e952192cdf2d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4432209,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Cotterman","original_name":"Charles Cotterman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657cc9afe22d2800c84412d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4432208,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Schaeffer Lucius","original_name":"Schaeffer Lucius","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657cc97f176a941737114993","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4432207,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Caralyn Moore","original_name":"Caralyn Moore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657cc9687a3c5200ca7b8acd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4432209,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Cotterman","original_name":"Charles Cotterman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657cc9ef176a94173062405f","department":"Camera","job":"Second Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4432212,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Edward Zak","original_name":"Edward Zak","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657cca22ddd52d011b69d618","department":"Crew","job":"Mixing Engineer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vkP6z1N3A8mw8pSIP5JT6WuAC1m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.737,"height":950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ap7oyYGmR3Coe0UViSywxkDY1Mj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Chicago Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Melomaniac Trailer 2","key":"854715519","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-08-15T16:07:09.000Z","id":"657cca84ba131b00e4379679"}]}}}
