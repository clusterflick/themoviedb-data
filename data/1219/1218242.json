Thousands of objects that belonged to the victims are emerging from the ground as fragile witnesses. This research must be completed, because the construction of a new museum-memorial is beginning.  How can the Shoah be commemorated on its own site, today and tomorrow, when an era without witnesses is emerging? How does the Shoah continue to work on the history and memory of Poland, of its citizens, within Europe, in a conflicting political context?  The film looks at these questions by showing and hearing the voices of archaeologists, historians, architects, journalists, curators, and visitors linked to Sobibor.","popularity":0.2564,"poster_path":"/8lITtl3l829ZOdD0jMomTsklc8R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97760,"logo_path":"/4ZKbXGBg1aR6PuNjw8SGf55USq7.png","name":"Dublin Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sheol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933339,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arnaud Sauli","original_name":"Arnaud Sauli","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657c517b7a3c52012d024cda","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470214,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeanne Oberson","original_name":"Jeanne Oberson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ddf9ef7776f0017c11bae2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386242,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Jacques Vogelbach","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Vogelbach","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ddfa0424b3330149b69fd4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438589,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis Cuniot","original_name":"Denis Cuniot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ddfa39eea34d0164b19f48","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751480,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fabrice Main","original_name":"Fabrice Main","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/tKwWtGIKaldLQeRmCus5ePHrf02.jpg","credit_id":"65ddf9af2ac499017dcba0dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751480,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fabrice Main","original_name":"Fabrice Main","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/tKwWtGIKaldLQeRmCus5ePHrf02.jpg","credit_id":"65ddf9d53ff2df01640ab108","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2369943,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jérémie Pouchard","original_name":"Jérémie Pouchard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ddfa23c92c5d017c4856f1","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751480,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fabrice Main","original_name":"Fabrice Main","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/tKwWtGIKaldLQeRmCus5ePHrf02.jpg","credit_id":"65ddf9e48c0a4801811eee0f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933339,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arnaud Sauli","original_name":"Arnaud Sauli","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ddf9c93ff2df01640ab0fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":938,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8lITtl3l829ZOdD0jMomTsklc8R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":662}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
