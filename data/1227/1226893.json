Scraps from old footage – sprocket holes, light leaks, film leaders, scratches (parts of the film material not intended for viewing) – are hand painted, collaged, and stitched together as a way to reclaim and honor their skill and labor as film editors and colorists. Here, color bleeds outside of the lines, while other moments break from convention and become chaotic and unruly. Visuals are contrasted against male narrators who dictate directions and explain how to correctly handle cinema technology.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/90P8xtTf7vNokv2JQotIgCOFf7j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Scraps: Film Threads and Sprocket Holes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4466265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krista Leigh Steinke","original_name":"Krista Leigh Steinke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65986a6e89b56100efc60e54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/90P8xtTf7vNokv2JQotIgCOFf7j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival of (In)appropriation, Berkeley CA","release_date":"2022-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
