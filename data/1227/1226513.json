Now, far from the confinements of the elite scientific establishment, Keller is free to pursue his controversial interpretations of quantum theory and their relationship to ancient sacred teachings on consciousness. One night, Keller's theories are put to the test when a former student shows up claiming to have had a premonition that something tragic is about to happen to his twin brother who is stationed in Afghanistan. Keller is skeptical, but then realizes that perhaps the proof he has long sought has just fallen into his lap. Xander Berkeley's outstanding performance makes real scientific ideas both accessible and engaging. Inspired by the work of Gregg Braden.","popularity":0.1655,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entanglement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael A.
