Having established himself as the building's resident curmudgeon, the embittered Jonathan is taken by surprise when Lupe, a 10-year-old girl with unflappable optimism, moves into the apartment next door with her grandparents. As an unlikely friendship blossoms between the two, shocking and painful secrets are revealed about both their lives. Ron Marasco's performance as Jonathan Page is, quite simply, acting at its finest. Tanya Ramero as Lupe will break your heart. Based on the writings of Louise Hay and her contributions to the gay community.","popularity":0.3139,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Painting the Future","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4464773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chioke Clayton","original_name":"Chioke Clayton","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65973fd7ed96bc5dc1f75742","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4464774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estaire Godinez","original_name":"Estaire Godinez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65973fdca6c1040f9bfab2bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4464775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trinidad Herrera","original_name":"Trinidad Herrera","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65973fe2ed96bc2e91f777f8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelina Llongueras","original_name":"Angelina Llongueras","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/pHP1QAHXmwXzX6caFwm4oA1Kxbl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65973fe9ef9d7240ea12b4ed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Marasco","original_name":"Ron Marasco","popularity":0.3601,"profile_path":"/gJv384DVD13lz4gWnfrD4IAMrpx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65973feeea37e006fa4cf9e5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael A.
