Taking inspiration from the principals and techniques of dada and surrealism, my film uses unorthodox techniques and focuses on the internal space. With collaboration between visuals, music, and sound design, we were able to create a world that depicts what the headspaces of anxiety and peace could be like.","popularity":0.0776,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Headspace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4075188,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Sophia Haboush","original_name":"Sophia Haboush","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659867a36e938a00ee4c29cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Double Exposure 2023 @ Indiana University Bloomington","release_date":"2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
