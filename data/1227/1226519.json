These life forms emerge from what we perceive as inert and forgotten remnants, and continue to evolve and foster new relationships with the ecosystem. Inflorescences portrays a world devoid of humans, yet its evolution is shaped by the remains they left behind.  As part of the project, four sculptures are crafted from electronic waste, incorporating screens and lights that evoke the entities depicted in the videos, offering a glimpse into the future of these discarded objects.","popularity":0.0811,"poster_path":"/sMrfbYc7xjlHy6nGTNlYKKVUnNi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inflorescences IV","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1517759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabrina Ratté","original_name":"Sabrina Ratté","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/zz3RPbpjeuNAD9bNoDr943xlr3h.jpg","credit_id":"659742e63a340b7fe6f0cad8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sMrfbYc7xjlHy6nGTNlYKKVUnNi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
