The world is absurd, and no one understands that better than Loriot. In this witty and whimsical adaptation of Leonard Bernstein’s operetta Candide, the legendary German comedian takes on the role of narrator, guiding the audience through Voltaire’s tale of optimism gone wrong. With sharp humor and elegant storytelling, Loriot adds his signature touch to Candide’s misadventures across war-torn lands, ill-fated romances, and philosophical catastrophes—all set to Bernstein’s dazzling score. A delightful blend of high culture and comedy, this Candide is as satirical as it is spectacular.","popularity":0.58,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":175,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leonard Bernstein: Candide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicco von Bülow","original_name":"Vicco von Bülow","popularity":0.2803,"profile_path":"/8Yo8Z2qFQNx99mCUXHtkGPqWHy4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6597668b0e64af23038c198c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4464997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald George","original_name":"Donald George","popularity":0.1092,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Candide","credit_id":"659766973a340b01def0db16","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Gazheli","original_name":"Thomas Gazheli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Pangloss / Martin","credit_id":"6597669fd7a70a128f69f664","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Volker Bengl","original_name":"Volker Bengl","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Gouverneur / Vanderdendur / Ragotski","credit_id":"659766a75907de752763c008","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3284044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Beck","original_name":"Johannes Beck","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Maximilian / Captain","credit_id":"659766b85cc11d783d7d4e60","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian Simson","original_name":"Florian Simson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Cosmetic Merchant / Prince Edward","credit_id":"659766d0ea37e006fa4d1b95","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4464999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holger Ohlmann","original_name":"Holger Ohlmann","popularity":0.1308,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Junkman / Inquisitor / King August / Croupier","credit_id":"659766da60c51d411f97880c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4465000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cornelia Götz","original_name":"Cornelia Götz","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Cunegonde","credit_id":"659766ecef9d725bc012b5fe","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4465001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Snejinka Ayramoya","original_name":"Snejinka Ayramoya","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Old Lady","credit_id":"659766fb726fb11254ab238c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4465002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Päivi Elina","original_name":"Päivi Elina","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Paquette","credit_id":"659767065907de6f4a63c20c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Loehle","original_name":"Peter Loehle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Bartender / Insquisitor / Tsar Ivan","credit_id":"6597670e3a340b0317f0c97d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4465004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Torsten Frisch","original_name":"Torsten Frisch","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Doctor / Inquisitor / King Stanislaus","credit_id":"6597671a869e756eb4070561","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4465005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Gann","original_name":"Michael Gann","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Alchemist / Grand Inquisitor / Sultan Achmet / Crook","credit_id":"6597672dfad8e916bbc2b292","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4465006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Stahl","original_name":"David Stahl","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self -
