A film about German and Soviet cameramen who worked on the Eastern Front. The war was, as it were, turned upside down in the cameras' lenses and reflected the interests and feelings not of the people filming, but the interests of officials and ideologists of the warring parties. The film is about how important it was to remain human on both sides of the front, even in the unbearable conditions of the war. And German, and Soviet, and, especially, a man with a camera in his hands.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War in Cinema Territory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2082238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Igor Grigoryev","original_name":"Igor Grigoryev","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/zIgEqL2sV3K4GTJ8oawMBPk2urV.jpg","credit_id":"6598a6727d55040096354c13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
