It is a journey into the darkest shadows, and the slivers of light that sometimes unmake them.  The story begins three days before an impending apocalypse. We follow Judith (J. Croft), who is incarcerated at the New Canaan Academy for Delinquents. NCAD is an ‘alternative’ to jail that has proven worse than Judith could have imagined.  Judith is consistently menaced by Reverend Hoelting, the Academy’s abusive and predatory figurehead. Things begin to change, however, when Judith is approached by Abra, another NCAD ward whom she has admired for some time. Together, Judith and Abra find love and hope in each other.  Ultimately, an inexplicable vision of a divine being calling itself ‘The Madonna’ inspires Judith to plot terrible wrath upon the person who has done her wrong.","popularity":0.3992,"poster_path":"/cpefZotBMaaT7LYaFtPcM1IJ3cT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story of love and vengeance at the end of the world.","title":"The Salvages","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4465161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
