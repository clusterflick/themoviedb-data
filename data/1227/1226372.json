The great Lenin led the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its people to create this powerful country. The working class became the masters of the country. Under Stalin's leadership, the Soviet Union as a whole developed significantly and prospered. However, since the death of Stalin in 1953, a political thought trend has spread inside and outside of the Soviet Union to attack the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its leaders, and completely repudiate the history of the Soviet Union. This trend is historical nihilism. It continuously uses lies to slander and discredit party leaders, destroying the beliefs of the people. In the end, even the leaders of the Soviet Union became pro-American elements and the main culprits responsible for splitting apart their own country.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hLYtuzV5lJsEH21ZDYSvqILgtu6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Reflections on the Disintegration of a Nation","title":"Historical Nihilism and the Fall of the USSR","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hLYtuzV5lJsEH21ZDYSvqILgtu6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
