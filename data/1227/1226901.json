A corrupted & glitched daydream. A futile endeavor to cope with visions of terror… Sunflower Fields Forever! I cut scenes from various films by necrorealist filmmaker Yevgeni Yufit into a new narrative influenced by the pain unleashed by Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine. This new cut was data moshed and printed with an inkjet printer. As I allowed the ink cartridges to run empty, the prints and colors became faulty, adding another layer of glitching. For some scenes the prints were manipulated even further by collaging, applying water to the ink or using sticky tape to tear off parts of the images. The sound too is made entirely with sounds found in the same films which I collaged and manipulated as well.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/sz9PYut2j4APU0Sl6Q0bxWqpKrf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"OilMoonNight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1912312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Malina Zemlianski","original_name":"Anna Malina Zemlianski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659872051d1bf401a8e4cc82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sz9PYut2j4APU0Sl6Q0bxWqpKrf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival of (In)appropriation, Berkeley, CA","release_date":"2023-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
