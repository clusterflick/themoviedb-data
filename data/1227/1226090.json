Lauded as a “classic” by Ian Wedde, the documentary is framed around the execution of a watershed piece: a large mural Hotere was commissioned to paint for Hamilton’s Founders Theatre. Interviews with friends and associates — poets Hone Tuwhare and Bill Manhire, art critics, officials and dealers — are intercut with fascinating shots of Hotere working (including making art by photocopying or 'xerography').","popularity":0.1038,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7700,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Zealand National Film Unit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1974-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ralph Hotere","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3216646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hone Tuwhare","original_name":"Hone Tuwhare","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6596146eea37e007534c3fcd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Pillsbury","original_name":"Sam Pillsbury","popularity":0.2431,"profile_path":"/kyqsKDpQG0t1jiuKPbXwWFuX9aK.jpg","credit_id":"659614990e64af605e8c1d32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Pillsbury","original_name":"Sam Pillsbury","popularity":0.2431,"profile_path":"/kyqsKDpQG0t1jiuKPbXwWFuX9aK.jpg","credit_id":"659614a3ef9d72248c12b063","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2892325,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lynton Diggle","original_name":"Lynton Diggle","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659614d9a698cf526343a179","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":135289,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Shennan","original_name":"Brian Shennan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659614f45907de1ca563bfab","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044350,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jack Body","original_name":"Jack Body","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65961512ef9d72120112b0e9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563404,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David H.
