In Things Arab Men Say, Egyptian-born filmmaker Nisreen Baker paints a very different picture.  Join Jay, Ghassan, and their friends as they gather at Jamal’s Eden Barber Shop for a haircut, a shave, and a lively discussion on politics, religion and identity. Although located in St. Albert, an Edmonton suburb, Jamal’s shop could be anywhere, serving as a microcosm of the Arab community.  At times serious, but laced with deft humour, the film follows the group as they debate the issues at hand and express often-surprising views that bring us closer to changing the narrative surrounding their community.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/xnOaAKiki9tWXTs9H5IhQpois7e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Things Arab Men Say","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4122094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nisreen Baker","original_name":"Nisreen Baker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6616a688b4a54301634d0239","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1695630,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bonnie Thompson","original_name":"Bonnie Thompson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6616a696cb6db5017ca9e14f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Christensen","original_name":"David Christensen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/l1CPoYVXwTNxXSMbpxze2ZaykuH.jpg","credit_id":"6616a6ad77c01f0163a46acb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133151,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hans Olson","original_name":"Hans Olson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6616a6cc77c01f0163a46ae1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2884435,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Daron Donahue","original_name":"Daron Donahue","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6616a6e8b4a54301494cffbd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1290985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Munson","original_name":"Aaron Munson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/y2LBWlbBmDq9WAj8kyujSgaSpsZ.jpg","credit_id":"6616a74beb79c20164a9cc27","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6533596","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oVVH0jQ6YZxmDGOKSai73wu5Oz6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xnOaAKiki9tWXTs9H5IhQpois7e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
