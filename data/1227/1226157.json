Argan, an \"imaginary patient\", wants to marry his daughter Angélique to a doctor, Thomas Diafoirus. His second wife, Béline, would like to send her daughter-in-law to the convent in order to recover a nice inheritance. Angélique loves Cléante, and Béralde, Argan's brother, tries to reason with his brother so that he sees more clearly in Béline's game, and so that he accedes to his daughter's wishes.  ​","popularity":0.0553,"poster_path":"/xyC056BWLFLV8SzBJNLyzDGCIUm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2001-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Malade imaginaire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le Malade Imaginaire","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Gallienne","original_name":"Guillaume Gallienne","popularity":0.3462,"profile_path":"/nponKvpwED1CivIY3f2NlQGLWE9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6596763160c51d2095978786","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1176,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xyC056BWLFLV8SzBJNLyzDGCIUm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2001-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
