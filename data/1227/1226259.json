At Versailles, in this sublime setting cut off from the world where she barricaded herself, Marie-Antoinette cultivated her own style and influenced, throughout Europe, the tastes of her time.","popularity":0.2256,"poster_path":"/pIOzcX4nNAAZtCxDIqGleFtPTtR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110369,"logo_path":"/girzZNbsSO1uJ4NTfKjRx3PWW8l.png","name":"Martange Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Treasures of Marie-Antoinette at Versailles","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2495666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florence Troquereau","original_name":"Florence Troquereau","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6596c63e5907de714f63bfe5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oyi8KSdCjMYEeSvyOicguMLaKWR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2500},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/oFLqfRXFmnE9AZsPOd4H7XtKiNA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/pIOzcX4nNAAZtCxDIqGleFtPTtR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/vep84dZJT6ZiH3miwwMU9dXcESb.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 5","release_date":"2024-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
