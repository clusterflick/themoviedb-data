Grappling with the history of Western architects using Indigenous motifs without significant reference to or engagement with their source, the film works to restore these absent sounds, utilizing 3D-printed replicas of Maya wind instruments held behind glass in pre-Columbian museum collections.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rXOsThSiUdmh4DjYfQhIco6As77.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MOJO’Q CHE B’IXAN RI IXKANULAB’ / ANTES DE QUE LOS VOLCANES CANTEN / BEFORE THE VOLCANOES SING","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4466480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clarissa Tossin","original_name":"Clarissa Tossin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65988fbd7d550400f1810e4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/euFkpvSwBWZHPAhrEsRQeh09ZsM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/J8hSgqaMBva7vBgEKxDeVgcFIo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fb7iCuC808IQU8p6WRYQ18DdRid.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3qHsiM5D46UP6mHgDiWDzQgkHHW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v5g7GrkahkMWkGRpdQJ85OW8T7m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vc13Os7SPl2AZoiqCiTnzAV1WCa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j8imhdt4NfYOEcEoR9BPKAS2JQC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hgyofgEbAsiGxDiTH70yoaHcaff.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2nPx24rsFYE7qI7yyVdClveK8UZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ivgHSL2c61sIBvf0jgCuH9tPL8H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t2PJ7BNuiesLZMFu94AZjxHtqi5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pkMy6d82czjItmZvOhOz0SGU9YP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8B7c0AOfl0AHnU9Mqs5BIMniDyb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t6RqbiCRxhyyxeVPtShyPT5cH6Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2b8gwy9ZD62cFmevB6jiyeTOrlV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uzV0KL8g9YbxJsuQmOmSiAQAaQV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uqIZP511lSbKH4mD1eTJdzz1M1f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6qwogYZpZ8whopOW0b5lK06iQFe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l7EpG6xeasDUPEMy2vNFO5LZQFj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oe9pm5kAHpqkAKBdOLubDyXA48J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1047,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rXOsThSiUdmh4DjYfQhIco6As77.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":698}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://bombmagazine.org/articles/2022/09/06/permission-to-return-home-clarissa-tossin-interviewed/#:~:text=collaboration%2C%20and%20communication.-,Clarissa%20Tossin's%20Mojo'q%20che%20b'ixan%20ri%20ixkanulab',New%20York%2C%20on%20September%209.","release_date":"2022-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
