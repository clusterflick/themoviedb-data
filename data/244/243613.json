As the road unfolds in front of them, so do their lives begin to intertwine. A small-time crook on the run, an ex-cop and his quiet ten-year-old son begin to bond together - at least until the secrets begin slipping out. Before Jean can figure out what is really going on, she finds herself already trapped in a spiraling nightmare where she will have to make a choice between turning her back on a little boy who needs her help, or sacrificing herself and going back to jail.","popularity":0.5157,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Find yourself","title":"Family","video":false,"vote_average":3.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boyd Kestner","original_name":"Boyd Kestner","popularity":0.2094,"profile_path":"/rJGKYuP4Cwmm9RZehumasiqTGSx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Eldon","credit_id":"52fe4ee0c3a36847f82ada67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Humphrey","original_name":"Renée Humphrey","popularity":0.2874,"profile_path":"/ePssPPOdSMqDm0vauGuDNDPcxyl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jean","credit_id":"52fe4ee0c3a36847f82ada6b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":181508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanner Richie","original_name":"Tanner Richie","popularity":0.153,"profile_path":"/vNqx7hhyep7xucDx45loUw79n1Z.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cole","credit_id":"52fe4ee0c3a36847f82ada6f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278671,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Joe Russo","original_name":"Joe Russo","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Luke","credit_id":"52fe4ee0c3a36847f82ada73","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":170317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Fennoy","original_name":"Dave Fennoy","popularity":0.5547,"profile_path":"/1azEou77GcmST8hYJmV30PhAyO6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Glen McKenzie","credit_id":"52fe4ee0c3a36847f82ada77","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Durek Verett","original_name":"Durek Verett","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Robbie","credit_id":"52fe4ee0c3a36847f82ada7b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237333,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"J.M.
