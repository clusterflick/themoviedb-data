If something isn't strange, he won't do it.  One day he meets Helen, and falls in love. This puts him in a dilemma, since love isn't strange at all... Or is it?  This film has everything... Loafs of bread, tooth brushes, keys, hats, a lawyer in a boat, some other people in another boat, a strangely painted cup, plastic animals in a train, real animals of various kinds, socks in the wild, the horizon, a big crazy fish (not real though), an incredible amount of whipped cream, a lamp post in love and some other stuff that you might have been waiting for.","popularity":0.2389,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2012-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Meaning of Hugo","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrik Elmér","original_name":"Henrik Elmér","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Hugo","credit_id":"614e6e98b04605008996f479","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":556488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathalie Söderqvist","original_name":"Nathalie Söderqvist","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/rInqL3CKb32bPXkURJfEFxyNZwV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Helén","credit_id":"614e6ec32d8ef3004218febb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anneli Heed","original_name":"Anneli Heed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Fågelprat (voice)","credit_id":"614e6f0ded2ac2008b51b324","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Oredsson","original_name":"Thomas Oredsson","popularity":0.1164,"profile_path":"/8iRFStfMDLFUtvb2SE58EbbF0dk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Den erfarne mannen","credit_id":"614e6f3567203d00655d908a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Harms Oredsson","original_name":"Eva Harms Oredsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Den erfarna kvinnan","credit_id":"614e6f692f8d09008b028201","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Olsson","original_name":"Jonas Olsson","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Taxichaufför","credit_id":"614e6fb92d8ef30062692d4f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Klingborg","original_name":"Stefan Klingborg","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Frisör","credit_id":"614e6ff3ed2ac20061da8f92","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annica Berg-Staflin","original_name":"Annica Berg-Staflin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bondgumma","credit_id":"614e700e140bad004300d0c1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Lindwall","original_name":"Lars Lindwall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Bondgubbe","credit_id":"614e70265ab81a002c3876bb","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilia von Strokirch","original_name":"Cecilia von Strokirch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Bibliotekarie","credit_id":"614e704b5ab81a002c387721","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mattias Reinholdsson","original_name":"Mattias Reinholdsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Grannen","credit_id":"614e705eb0460500285cb78f","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":92405,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fredrik T.
