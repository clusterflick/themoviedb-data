The film is a dramatization of a farmerâ€™s last day on his ancestral farm on Prince Edward Island as he is faced with the Public Auction of his family home and possessions. On the one hand, it is a simple, poignant tale of personal loss, alienation and the displacement of the old at the end of life. On the other, it is a political statement about the loss of Canadian Heritage, land and economy to foreign capital. It was nominated for an Academy Award (Short Subject) in 1972. It was named Best Documentary at the 24th Canadian Film Awards.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/zWfxvoQOp3LYGSHTboJjpMlKqdj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Selling Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3227426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Macgoughan","original_name":"Vernon Macgoughan","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61393e14e93e95002bc37e6c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3227427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Hogg","original_name":"Bob Hogg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61393e222cde980062ddd993","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3227429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank McNutt","original_name":"Frank McNutt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61393e33da9ef20044619dc1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2420042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Winter","original_name":"Pamela Winter","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61393e419369a20043001926","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1227281,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jack Winter","original_name":"Jack Winter","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61393dffd036b600446f8af0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1494744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tadeusz Jaworski","original_name":"Tadeusz Jaworski","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61393e802cde98002b6ef6f8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3227430,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bruce Allen","original_name":"Bruce Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61393e9afba6250062a92ae4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3175063,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stanley Lipinsky","original_name":"Stanley Lipinsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61393eafb7abb5002bb737ee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2540679,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Cornell","original_name":"Peter Cornell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61393ec47a1bd6002cfc5ee4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491537,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Martin Pepler","original_name":"Martin Pepler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61393edef5cb2100451d78f3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1494744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tadeusz Jaworski","original_name":"Tadeusz Jaworski","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f78b02c3a3680424005bac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0069245","wikidata_id":"Q7448660","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zWfxvoQOp3LYGSHTboJjpMlKqdj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
