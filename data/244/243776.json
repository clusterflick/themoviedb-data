Junko Furuta, a female 17 year old high school student, was kidnapped and confined in a house by four other male high school students (all juvenile) in the Ayase district of Adachi-ku, Tokyo, where she was repeatedly raped, sexually humiliated and tortured in an extremely brutish manner for 41 days before she finally died after a particularly severe beating. The boys hid her body in a drum and filled it with concrete, but the body was nonetheless discovered a few months later.","popularity":1.2658,"poster_path":"/f7CPfYN2bxr43Cr4fCYWjUKoVEs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Concrete-Encased High School Girl Murder Case: Broken Seventeen-Year-Olds","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"女子高生コンクリート詰め殺人事件~壊れたセブンティーンたち","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1407415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yujin Kitagawa","original_name":"北川悠仁","popularity":0.3035,"profile_path":"/9f99JHPHT2vZrXSiL7g4tI1j4Yl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa749c2fcb8cc0040820505","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Satoru Saito","original_name":"斉藤暁","popularity":0.3852,"profile_path":"/fQrAEsi9PAovMy7pGmD6YRgJXzE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa749d1a402c1004033974a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eisuke Sasai","original_name":"篠井英介","popularity":0.4941,"profile_path":"/wodKYG7zTWCVtQfWp4PlQS1vtuF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa749dcfcb8cc003e83f540","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katsuya Matsumura","original_name":"松村克弥","popularity":0.2466,"profile_path":"/gwGmFB48IU2qYlKeAk20tHNxk9q.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ee3c3a36847f82ae6af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katsuya Matsumura","original_name":"松村克弥","popularity":0.2466,"profile_path":"/gwGmFB48IU2qYlKeAk20tHNxk9q.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ee3c3a36847f82ae6a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0451781","wikidata_id":"Q11446396","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/S8FJwgikhzQFnlRItoRQzWSFd7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gfNi205JWu78X59W7KFLIGPr8Oi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/f7CPfYN2bxr43Cr4fCYWjUKoVEs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5927,"name":"violence against women"},{"id":18005,"name":"high school friends"},{"id":157714,"name":"sadistic torture"},{"id":159551,"name":"pink film"},{"id":344427,"name":"junko furuta"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
