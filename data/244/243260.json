This film profiles the lives of the nine African-American students who integrated Central High in Little Rock, Arkansas, during the fall of 1957. The film documents the perspective of Jefferson Thomas and his fellow students seven years after their historic achievement. Central to this story is their quiet but brave entrance into Little Rock High, escorted by armed troops under the intense pressure of the on looking crowd. We learn first hand their impressions of the past and present and their hopes for the future. Their selfless heroism broke the integration crisis and pioneered a new era. This film went on to win an Academy AwardÂ® for Best Documentary Short in 1964.","popularity":0.485,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":71144,"logo_path":null,"name":"U.S. Information Agency","origin_country":""},{"id":79919,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guggenheim Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nine from Little Rock","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1247074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Green","original_name":"Ernest Green","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"579f401092514143bb00231a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thelma Mothershed","original_name":"Thelma Mothershed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"579f4019925141438f0020fe","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Guggenheim","original_name":"Charles Guggenheim","popularity":0.1697,"profile_path":"/wrHL8VTsQw6xH13Ikdh2F1DFkAx.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4edbc3a36847f82ac64f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Guggenheim","original_name":"Charles Guggenheim","popularity":0.1697,"profile_path":"/wrHL8VTsQw6xH13Ikdh2F1DFkAx.jpg","credit_id":"579f4039c3a3683c650008ac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659570,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shelby Storck","original_name":"Shelby Storck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579f4045c3a36816eb001117","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659570,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shelby Storck","original_name":"Shelby Storck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579f404f92514116550009d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659571,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Burrill Phillips","original_name":"Burrill Phillips","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579f4058925141438f00211c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659572,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert Pierce","original_name":"Robert Pierce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579f4085c3a3683ba90009d9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0058410","wikidata_id":"Q1992953","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6984,"name":"racial segregation"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
