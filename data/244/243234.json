The film is hosted/presented by Richard Burton, Thomas's friend, who narrates the story and appears from time to time amidst the Welsh landscape. Burton had already appeared in Douglas Cleverdon's acclaimed BBC radio dramatization of Thomas's 'play for voices' Under Milk Wood in the 1950s and, in the early Seventies, would appear in director Andrew Sinclair's film version as First Voice.  Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in partnership with The Film Foundation and National Screen and Sound Archive of Wales in 2000.","popularity":1.8891,"poster_path":"/5rqP6uBVXVgUxZmTCj4g3ATfMw4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tribute to Dylan Thomas","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dylan Thomas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Burton","original_name":"Richard Burton","popularity":1.1853,"profile_path":"/aEofbdM6kVs77cdJAGeOyM434rY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4edbc3a36847f82ac549","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Howells","original_name":"Jack Howells","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4edbc3a36847f82ac545","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2508281,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edward Williams","original_name":"Edward Williams","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656a3c3c0859b400ff748087","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0055943","wikidata_id":"Q1268783","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5rqP6uBVXVgUxZmTCj4g3ATfMw4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309397,"name":"preserved film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
