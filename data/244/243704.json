At its dark heart is Hiker Meat, an archetypal 1970s slasher movie imagined by Shovlin, complete with hitchhiking heroine, charismatic commune leader and a group of teens who disappear one by one.  This tantalising film-within-a-film serves to both deconstruct and pay affectionate homage to the often-maligned exploitation style.  Having created a full screenplay, score and cut-and-paste prototype for Hiker Meat, Shovlin filmed key sections and a full trailer in an intense shoot in the Lake District in summer 2013. Rough Cut contrasts these re-made sequences with on-set footage and insights into the development of Hiker Meatâ€™s script, soundtrack and design, to create a compelling mash-up of self-referencing processes, behind-the-scenes viewpoints and time-honoured slasher tropes.","popularity":0.1978,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":47119,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cornerhouse Artist Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How do you remake a film that never existed?","title":"Rough Cut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1430203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Aspen","original_name":"Agnes Aspen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54e9ea5d9251412eb4003de2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1430204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Houston","original_name":"Ashley Houston","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54e9ea61c3a36836ed00432a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1430205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Dearsley","original_name":"Jack Dearsley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54e9ea789251412eb1004046","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1430206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Young","original_name":"Bob Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"54e9ea889251412eb100404d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie Shovlin","original_name":"Jamie Shovlin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ee1c3a36847f82ae23d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2639933,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bren O'Callaghan","original_name":"Bren O'Callaghan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebed39915a4a1001c9eca62","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2639934,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Euan Rodger","original_name":"Euan Rodger","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebed3a315a4a1001c9eca81","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306407,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Grey","original_name":"John Grey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebed3e915a4a1001d9e19aa","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2639935,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adam Milburn","original_name":"Adam Milburn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebed3f38e2e000021164074","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie Shovlin","original_name":"Jamie Shovlin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebed3fd15a4a1001c9ecb80","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3009468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"},{"id":9732,"name":"film in film"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
