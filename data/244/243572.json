The Krenholm Manufacturing Company founded on that island in 1857 was closed down for good in 2010. There is not a single family in Narva that has not been affected by the bankruptcy of the textile factory. Unemployed men, homeless children, street beggars, drug addicts, thieves—these are the people that live in this Russian-speaking Estonian town. It is like a bad dream. Where can they find salvation? Soviet nostalgia dies hard in this town, as does rage caused by wasted lives. How can they build new lives from these ruins? Is it possible to do the impossible?","popularity":0.1256,"poster_path":"/5eLqKnNi6Ve49PBA5JD8TVOvVKk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6153,"logo_path":null,"name":"F-Seitse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2012-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Russians on Crow Island","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Вороний остров","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137611,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kaie-Ene Rääk","original_name":"Kaie-Ene Rääk","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/qvbBA8rx7NMMMO2PwYGaklR6sO.jpg","credit_id":"651b69e3c50ad200eabf65a6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sulev Keedus","original_name":"Sulev Keedus","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":"/umwLj8O8enB2h8dmToQspp4kk7w.jpg","credit_id":"651b69c1ea84c7014efcf030","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sulev Keedus","original_name":"Sulev Keedus","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":"/umwLj8O8enB2h8dmToQspp4kk7w.jpg","credit_id":"651b69b79d592c0102c0f41e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137611,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kaie-Ene Rääk","original_name":"Kaie-Ene Rääk","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/qvbBA8rx7NMMMO2PwYGaklR6sO.jpg","credit_id":"651b69aa07216600c567de2e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1595168,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ivo Felt","original_name":"Ivo Felt","popularity":0.1549,"profile_path":"/vvzZ32j3zMCnrGt75eK74dpK3Js.jpg","credit_id":"651b69ee223a8b013df64c88","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sulev Keedus","original_name":"Sulev Keedus","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":"/umwLj8O8enB2h8dmToQspp4kk7w.jpg","credit_id":"65aceb9667b613010c5f5cfa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2279300","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5eLqKnNi6Ve49PBA5JD8TVOvVKk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
