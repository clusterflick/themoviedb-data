There, he makes a fleeting acquaintance in the tram with its driver: Jeanne. He finds accommodation in a flat block under the care of the slightly eccentric concierge Denise. A short time later, he finds work as a dishwasher in a restaurant where he meets his humorous colleagues Bert and Désiré. Coincidence exists because Jeanne lives in the flat below his. They get to know each other better and Harry falls in love with her, although he has a hard time expressing those feelings.","popularity":0.2693,"poster_path":"/vWowmRRe8OVvbIblhzZczrqIQnw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1995-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manneken Pis","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antje De Boeck","original_name":"Antje De Boeck","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/eTABvtb4QYaiUgOMW8CSVkTQOkS.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jeanne","credit_id":"537b7a0c0e0a26396b0000b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Vercruyssen","original_name":"Frank Vercruyssen","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/iQu7sP27fQu19kewLfghclEhqWO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"537b7a350e0a2639710000cc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Petersen","original_name":"Ann Petersen","popularity":0.1081,"profile_path":"/iSuePg2z97FbaGIZY4q5RHMHM8G.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Denise","credit_id":"537b7a480e0a2639740000c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wim Opbrouck","original_name":"Wim Opbrouck","popularity":0.2311,"profile_path":"/vXbbkDJOgmQKpRnJ7CKwMXl4EWv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bert","credit_id":"537b7a680e0a2639740000c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stany Crets","original_name":"Stany Crets","popularity":0.1019,"profile_path":"/qZeIfRUWWMdWoEoOHL4hkA7qMWW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Désiré","credit_id":"537b7a810e0a26396e0000aa","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73383,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank van Passel","original_name":"Frank van Passel","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c5f6abc3a3680d4900331c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113767","wikidata_id":"Q2153661","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cBY5uErgFoXOwAzixMKvY9FJJM9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kr5mvyMytRx3fnlkDxgKqc0DolP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1402,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/vWowmRRe8OVvbIblhzZczrqIQnw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":935}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"1995","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
