The film -- partly a tribute to the work of the pioneering naturalist and ornithologist Gilbert White (1720-1793), author of The Natural History of Selborne -- features a commentary by the poet Laurie Lee, and camerawork by the wildlife cinematographer Patrick Carey. The journey suggested by the title is through time rather than space. In fact, two such journeys are made: the first back to the eighteenth century to pay tribute to the work of White, and the second studies the changing natural landscape near White's home town of Selborne in Hampshire between a typical March and May. It was nominated for two Academy Awards -- one for Best Documentary Short, and the other for Best Live Action Short.","popularity":0.2324,"poster_path":"/2HzYVpMzEqp1d4su40C6QTVjXRi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52835,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Transport Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1958-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey Into Spring","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Murray","original_name":"Stephen Murray","popularity":0.1164,"profile_path":"/ixPaDvILsMBTI2HsSQt4Mmxa0Vo.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a6660a20e0a26031800506c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366766,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laurie Lee","original_name":"Laurie Lee","popularity":0.1266,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6660d60e0a26030e004d65","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086467,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edgar Anstey","original_name":"Edgar Anstey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/eJdn6dkMbySMdMXfj2dMGAECgRH.jpg","credit_id":"5a6660e6c3a3685745004e16","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506035,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ian Ferguson","original_name":"Ian Ferguson","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6660ec0e0a260315004d43","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Carey","original_name":"Patrick Carey","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/itqTfFUNdL6bZ9m4DtmxJuFYPkj.jpg","credit_id":"5a666100925141574b004869","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115779,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ralph Sheldon","original_name":"Ralph Sheldon","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6661099251415742004be8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1965520,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ken Cameron","original_name":"Ken Cameron","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a666155c3a3685745004e80","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39055,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Muir Mathieson","original_name":"Muir Mathieson","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6661600e0a260315004da7","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965521,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Fisher","original_name":"James Fisher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a666174c3a3685705004bd9","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479943,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hugh Raggett","original_name":"Hugh Raggett","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6661889251415748004ad5","department":"Crew","job":"Production Office Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965525,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Edward Scott","original_name":"Edward Scott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6661970e0a26031e004eee","department":"Crew","job":"Production Office Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralph Keene","original_name":"Ralph Keene","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae3bee592514177750001c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2270246,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lewis McLeod","original_name":"Lewis McLeod","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c937bcf0e0a261042e8925a","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2508281,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edward Williams","original_name":"Edward Williams","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faba4bf41a5610042a37a96","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0051802","wikidata_id":"Q6296396","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2HzYVpMzEqp1d4su40C6QTVjXRi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dmhjFtWwtPEOkpct4rSHn7ViULQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1958-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
