Until three years ago when everything changed. Friendship became love that is well beyond all conventions. A Part of the society feels provoked by such kind of companionship and meets them with some lack of understanding to say the least. Even their parents aren't really fond of the situation. Once a year, the trio makes a trip. During which they try to let emotion flow as they come, not having to fear the reactions of others. Now there is the time again for such a trip. And that is where the film starts. After renting a mobile home the journey starts as usual. Only one thing different this time, Jonas was diagnosed with cancer in terminal state a few months ago. The three of them know that this might very well be the last trip they will ever make. Regardless, Mia and Lukas try their best for Jonas not to think of the inevitable. Sadly the vow to spend the last trip only in joy, fails.","popularity":0.0993,"poster_path":"/sFotncTLAhEcMYhSSbI1udGxm35.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18809,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beyond Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"More Than Friendship","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1279036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Fichtner","original_name":"Michèle Fichtner","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mia Strömer","credit_id":"52fe4ee7c3a36847f82af931","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holger Foest","original_name":"Holger Foest","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jonas L.
