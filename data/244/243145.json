Sibrel made this film as a follow-up to his 2001 video A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon, which accuses NASA of falsifying the Apollo 11 mission photography. The title of the film is a wordplay on the Girls Gone Wild video series.","popularity":0.927,"poster_path":"/avsranV9JzNPHuWjXEoXVohD20o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":262,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Film Distributors","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Investigation Into the Authenticity of the Moon Landings","title":"Astronauts Gone Wild: An Investigation Into the Authenticity of the Moon Landings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buzz Aldrin","original_name":"Buzz Aldrin","popularity":0.3272,"profile_path":"/gUuAUCEAR3ut3ZX1a5iiz5tegk0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4edac3a36847f82ac133","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278291,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bart Winfield Sibrel","original_name":"Bart Winfield Sibrel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4edac3a36847f82ac137","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":595477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Bean","original_name":"Alan Bean","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4edac3a36847f82ac13b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Cernan","original_name":"Eugene Cernan","popularity":0.1807,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4edac3a36847f82ac13f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar D.
