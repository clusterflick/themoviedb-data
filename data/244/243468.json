She believes that she has the gift of talking to animals and that they are like brothers to her. 'I speak to them with my mind, or through my eyes, my heart or my soul, and I see that they understand and answer me.' Tippi is the daughter of French filmmakers and wildlife photographers, Alain Degre and Sylvie Robert, who have captured her on film with some of Africa's most beautiful and dangerous animals. Tippi shares her thoughts and wisdom on Africa, its people and the animals she has come to know and love. Often her wisdom is beyond her years, and her innocence and obvious rapport with the animals is both fascinating and charming.","popularity":0.5798,"poster_path":"/m9jgCpvq3YBXDXf14R1rj5iyZ0X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The little girl who talks to the animals","title":"The World According to Tippi","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1197456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tippi Degré","original_name":"Tippi Degré","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"herself","credit_id":"52fe4eddc3a36847f82acf5f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Crye","original_name":"Christian Crye","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eddc3a36847f82acf65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0926112","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sotGUx1YEmgXz9OS9GHEPUYA1Kv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qd5gC405MWwDQjXfaxhX3IMDlvq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6bbHEeF5u8KzRlr6LssyLt7j0IP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qtu72C3F6YDMGRSKD9J72z5LKZ5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/839FRWGHDOVoRebKHCLVvb67KBS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cL1g4GaUNJS7FMm8YgOIVMKIYQH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4pthvmnB33VYsqAeJ3i3SRKPCJi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6hJngrRMgtzC3IQvUd0ZMhmN1SQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1436,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m9jgCpvq3YBXDXf14R1rj5iyZ0X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":958}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1534,"name":"attachment to nature"},{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":2526,"name":"human animal relationship"},{"id":3593,"name":"wilderness"},{"id":9140,"name":"namibia"},{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":155297,"name":"bushman"},{"id":157955,"name":"childhood"},{"id":167625,"name":"talking to animals"},{"id":194154,"name":"sociology of childhood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
