Morgenstern’s presentation of the incident serves as a metaphor for the horror of the Holocaust, and provides a powerful trigger for discussion of the disturbing issues raised by the film. The figure of the children's’ teacher specifically parallels Janusz Korcak (1879-1942), a famous Jewish educator who ran an orphanage in the Warsaw ghetto and died with his young charges at Treblinka.","popularity":0.3833,"poster_path":"/mnar5T7UwRttRh5jlK3BROsLsEK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6551,"logo_path":null,"name":"Se-Ma-For","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ambulance","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":717140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zbigniew Józefowicz","original_name":"Zbigniew Józefowicz","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/x1JbASoum935Y7C63DEV2S2jOiX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"SS-man (uncredited)","credit_id":"5c2d2edc0e0a2655fa3b53aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2147018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leopold Rene Nowak","original_name":"Leopold Rene Nowak","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/njbjTO4AhXylyIw1vcBLKuKw0KC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Driver (uncredited)","credit_id":"5c2d2ee70e0a2655fa3b53af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2206864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marek Sniatkiewicz","original_name":"Marek Sniatkiewicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Boy (uncredited)","credit_id":"5c2d2ef80e0a2642d6397d7f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bogusław Sochnacki","original_name":"Bogusław Sochnacki","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":"/oJZpeYj87Wruiq7c1dNQwR578Ix.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Watchman (uncredited)","credit_id":"5c2d2f0292514122ae6edf8c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26962,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jerzy Lipman","original_name":"Jerzy Lipman","popularity":0.0951,"profile_path":"/bkwyQ1I52juMy1VA20xBAxELavi.jpg","credit_id":"61a91ebe35a61e0089801124","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12013,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Krzysztof Komeda","original_name":"Krzysztof Komeda","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a91eae7ecd28002dc1f93e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836049,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Radlicz","original_name":"Jan Radlicz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a91ed1e267de00277ca320","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54077,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Janina Niedźwiecka","original_name":"Janina Niedźwiecka","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/c3JP7q4e1hndlbQc3otbLFpmOz6.jpg","credit_id":"61a91ec8d6819b002be615c3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tadeusz Łomnicki","original_name":"Tadeusz Łomnicki","popularity":0.1468,"profile_path":"/vov48bUzsE3r9PuARvsbSCZWW3D.jpg","credit_id":"5c2d2ec20e0a2642d6397d0f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janusz Morgenstern","original_name":"Janusz Morgenstern","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/pB4phPF0WwZtsag2ZPnGSQe0Scl.jpg","credit_id":"5c2d2ecd0e0a2609ed3829a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0172112","wikidata_id":"Q11685614","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":754,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/22VgMsAdkXaHDUaT7Y1EzRvyQFJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":523},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/mnar5T7UwRttRh5jlK3BROsLsEK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
