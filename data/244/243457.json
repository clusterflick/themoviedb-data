For over four decades he has run a specialized bookshop in the shopping square of the town. Every morning before opening his shop, he has a nice cup of black coffee at the local cafe where he has a nice small talk with Julien, the barkeeper, and with the regulars. Everybody likes him. At least everybody did... Everything actually started to change the night his young wife Tina disappeared without trace. Now, Monsieur Joseph has become Youssef again, he is again the \"foreigner\" (wasn't he born of Kabyle parents?), the shady foreigner, the frightening foreigner... He can't but have murdered his wife, all the more as another woman was killed four years before without the culprit having been arrested. There is no smoke without fire, is there?...","popularity":0.1366,"poster_path":"/9XFNiEJVWf57iAcEULPbvt1VgoT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106374,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fontana","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":11359,"logo_path":"/aqWJRi66t2oMPMmC60CdK9I3WQd.png","name":"France 2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":106456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jade Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":75242,"logo_path":"/hrZzmOGhzhv473sIInHtSNwQOhT.png","name":"Pictanovo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monsieur Joseph","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Маленький человек из Архангельска","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Prévost","original_name":"Daniel Prévost","popularity":0.3226,"profile_path":"/oXgHTf056G7gjS290Nadn05CbPT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Monsieur Joseph","credit_id":"52fe4eddc3a36847f82ace41","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie-Marie Parmentier","original_name":"Julie-Marie Parmentier","popularity":0.1524,"profile_path":"/1WMAwFRt70QPHuMf5n8YXqFlS0H.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tina","credit_id":"52fe4eddc3a36847f82ace45","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Riaboukine","original_name":"Serge Riaboukine","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":"/G2Lv14IXlkK5WuwaS89XbJF5Ki.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Le commissaire Boucheron","credit_id":"653e0510e894a600ff172388","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":212103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Davenier","original_name":"Catherine Davenier","popularity":0.1635,"profile_path":"/elnulmxv3sTf8Ul57gwmb6wqTjl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Martine Palestri","credit_id":"653e0537519bbb00ab691461","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3565774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franckie Defonte","original_name":"Franckie Defonte","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":"/k2jEvFFvwdo8AjV6AA7nBpXquSB.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Fred","credit_id":"653e055350733c00adbc7dce","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didier Lafaye","original_name":"Didier Lafaye","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/9AHd3GtzjLS9X62eLwxLgQRDmgX.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ancel","credit_id":"653e057950733c00e249cc82","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Langlois","original_name":"Olivier Langlois","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eddc3a36847f82ace4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24534,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Georges Simenon","original_name":"Georges Simenon","popularity":0.4015,"profile_path":"/oxehFO24YpEMhK4YUlL50px6C8v.jpg","credit_id":"5b423d339251414f5c012913","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1105371","wikidata_id":"Q3321397","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tRfdjHwcHRCByrdV5rMuHtuNmXy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9XFNiEJVWf57iAcEULPbvt1VgoT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/iQk4KFrwkLhxKSoqcjbVpjILavX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
