It shows the inspiration behind Inuit sculpture. The Inuit approach to the work is to release the image the artist sees imprisoned in the rough stone. The film centres on an old legend about the carving of the image of a sea spirit to bring food to a hungry camp. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short.","popularity":0.6636,"poster_path":"/31ioegMBvz4KI7EPAkgBB1iJZ43.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1958-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Living Stone","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1782217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Whalley","original_name":"George Whalley","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5f90ce7dc8f858003a69d2b9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Feeney","original_name":"John Feeney","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587e404fc3a36847e80278da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085822,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maurice Blackburn","original_name":"Maurice Blackburn","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ead071927d9cc001bcf3845","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085846,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Daly","original_name":"Tom Daly","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f90cdf4e7414600399c12a7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Carey","original_name":"Patrick Carey","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/itqTfFUNdL6bZ9m4DtmxJuFYPkj.jpg","credit_id":"5f90ce1ae7414600379bbfe1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Low","original_name":"Colin Low","popularity":0.0881,"profile_path":"/nLNsXY9AzmjEfSoDXniMgwVGflJ.jpg","credit_id":"5f90ce24383df20036ae802d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289431,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wally Gentleman","original_name":"Wally Gentleman","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f90ce34f8aee80033ca3d0f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Feeney","original_name":"John Feeney","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f90ce44383df20033ac870d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Feeney","original_name":"John Feeney","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f90ce4fd9f4a60038d9a4f2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087078,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Croll","original_name":"George Croll","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f90ce5c7614210038898d76","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637276,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stuart Baker","original_name":"Stuart Baker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f90ce6aca83540036b3ab12","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0051872","wikidata_id":"Q7747896","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/31ioegMBvz4KI7EPAkgBB1iJZ43.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":3355,"name":"inuit"},{"id":6024,"name":"sculpture"},{"id":266403,"name":"carving"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1958-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
