The subject deals with the children at The Royal School for the Deaf in Margate, Kent. The hearing-handicapped children are shown painstakingly learning what words are through exercises and games, practicing lip-reading and finally speech. Richard Burton's calm and sometimes-poetic narration adds to the heartwarming cheerfulness and courage of the children.  Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in partnership with British Film Institute in 2005.","popularity":0.2544,"poster_path":"/3c74Bn54lpp7Tiv5gZPBQDpg8pe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18760,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Wide Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":24838,"logo_path":null,"name":"Morse Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1954-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thursday's Children","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Burton","original_name":"Richard Burton","popularity":1.1853,"profile_path":"/aEofbdM6kVs77cdJAGeOyM434rY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"537375fdc3a3681509001334","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329169,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Geoffrey Wright","original_name":"Geoffrey Wright","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5395d78ac3a368644600482f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lindsay Anderson","original_name":"Lindsay Anderson","popularity":0.5796,"profile_path":"/l4R2RoLdqtY8xLrrt6v176tbtNQ.jpg","credit_id":"53737598c3a368150900132d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Brenton","original_name":"Guy Brenton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537376140e0a267c6e0018a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Brenton","original_name":"Guy Brenton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537376330e0a267c5f0019f3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lindsay Anderson","original_name":"Lindsay Anderson","popularity":0.5796,"profile_path":"/l4R2RoLdqtY8xLrrt6v176tbtNQ.jpg","credit_id":"537376240e0a267c67001952","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36967,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Walter Lassally","original_name":"Walter Lassally","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/7Ux3TCeW6vQTFRnjNgWWwJOQb7A.jpg","credit_id":"5cf391bd0e0a261e1bce2679","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0047585","wikidata_id":"Q2430157","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3c74Bn54lpp7Tiv5gZPBQDpg8pe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":716},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/znNr1MSKyTUeVGHypZJHibnt9sZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309397,"name":"preserved film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1954-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1955-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
