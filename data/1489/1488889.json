Wanted during the German Occupation, the young man secretly met with his mother, Lela, for the needs of the struggle. Yet, even under those harsh conditions, he had the chance to experience the tenderness and affection of the heroine, who never ceased to be a mother.  Illegal film footage captures rare images of Occupied Athens, while Giorgos’ fragmented memories still carry something of \"\"Violetta di Parma,\"\" Lela Karagianni's favorite perfume.","popularity":0.1214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":108739,"logo_path":null,"name":"E.R.T.","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Bouboulina of the Greek resistance","title":"Lela Karayanni: the Fragrance of a Heroine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Λέλα Καραγιάννη","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Lela Karayanni","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Fragrance of a Heroine","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5467799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yorgos Karayannis","original_name":"Yorgos Karayannis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6836e83ab457cf5dd1056116","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1994872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vassilis Loules","original_name":"Vassilis Loules","popularity":0.2511,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836e850498f2497a8731685","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1994872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vassilis Loules","original_name":"Vassilis Loules","popularity":0.2511,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836e86e0e7cbb0327038154","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650948,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vangelis Fambas","original_name":"Vangelis Fambas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836e89b2d616b90cab6c42e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5467802,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kostas Tsekouras","original_name":"Kostas Tsekouras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836e8dc249fc96d95732ca3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5467805,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dimitris Giannakopoulos","original_name":"Dimitris Giannakopoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836e928cd1c8829aa730a9d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351104,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Takis Koumoundouros","original_name":"Τάκης Κουμουνδούρος","popularity":0.1433,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836e9455b3914339e4151e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5467806,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Konstantinos Psyhogios","original_name":"Konstantinos Psyhogios","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836e98c079a42e2870382ac","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1573210","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
