This is Ivonne Pierrot, a companion of the French nuns who disappeared during the last military dictatorship. Fearing for her life, she went into exile in 1978, only to return once democracy was restored. The documentary is a portrait of this woman who plays a fundamental role in her community, defending the rights of the most vulnerable and continuing the struggle for which she was persecuted during the years of state terrorism.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/stTFkA8ClY692wtLFrqz0T6xyC0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2004-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Un camino de liberacion","title":"Missionnaire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0407007","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jm6NcQNo9VVApqSxveRhjBeATnp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/stTFkA8ClY692wtLFrqz0T6xyC0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
