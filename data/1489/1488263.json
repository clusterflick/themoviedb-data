The director of the Museum of Ukrainian Culture, Professor Kornienko, stays away from politics and tries to work with his daughter in what he considers to be \"pure\" science. That is why he treats the revolutionary events as an unfortunate but passing phenomenon. His main concern is to preserve the heritage of the people at all costs, even by smuggling some of it abroad. Gradually (not without the influence of the Red Commissar and his own daughter), Professor Kornienko comes to the conclusion that the revolution is not an enemy of culture.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cgSQ7ZnHumoaVKwX1peGnE0CBqB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25065,"logo_path":"/ugfX3cgasxoDtUjkmWqlthK4hja.png","name":"VUFKU","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1930-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Museum Guard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Хранитель музея","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Охоронець музею","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1787881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Zamychkovskyi","original_name":"Ivan Zamychkovskyi","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Professor","credit_id":"68358bb68adc52301fb6bc98","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1912050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Li","original_name":"Nina Li","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/bDa6sXKoTJNe6BJRJlevoFnGOfM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mariyka, his daughter","credit_id":"68358bc84cf65dea80838589","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stepan Shahaida","original_name":"Степан Шагайда","popularity":0.1289,"profile_path":"/l78BXE9SQMEZpFtjgk3ASGlivM7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Comissar","credit_id":"68358be07cfd4c5e9b055b16","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5465468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oles Podorozhnyi","original_name":"Oles Podorozhnyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Khmara","credit_id":"68358bf1e4293714eaeb36d4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2038170,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Hryhorii Dovzhenko","original_name":"Hryhorii Dovzhenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68358c04155bf9d9358383d3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4084872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Borys Tiahno","original_name":"Borys Tiahno","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":"/z2IVtSN1A4t15b8E736Jrtioop9.jpg","credit_id":"68358c13fca5da67032b7a17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2508609,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Moisei Zats","original_name":"Moisei Zats","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68358c21977e78e7aaa8784b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1209868,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Boris Zavelev","original_name":"Борис Завелев","popularity":0.1696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68358c36d52d48e4412b7a47","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352391,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Yosyp Shpinel","original_name":"Yosyp Shpinel","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/1EPw4QzV08tTpqspYyeodep7peg.jpg","credit_id":"68358c46e5812546b78385b5","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k63eQRT84IsksC1hz8xMpHtHSlD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cgSQ7ZnHumoaVKwX1peGnE0CBqB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
