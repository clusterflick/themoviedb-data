The Board of Education vs The Board of Incarceration uncovers the true purpose of today’s educational system and how it’s failing the African child. Going beyond the school-to-prison pipeline headlines and conspiracy theories, The Board of Education Vs. The Board of Incarceration proves that something sinister is afloat by digging deep to explore its origin, its existence and how to plot its destruction to save every Black child.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pwWTE9uxiXpuMidXSgRiGV2gng6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":263591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rasha Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":263592,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rasha Vision Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Board of Education vs Board of Incarceration","title":"Elementary Genocide 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3618030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umar Johnson","original_name":"Umar Johnson","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":"/cuD2vWBNoIzbHORZg9ROHhfJItl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68364d02079a42e287037fa4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2398525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boyce Watkins","original_name":"Boyce Watkins","popularity":0.1682,"profile_path":"/eEgwNm1kUo73jCYlPB9EyYeJ2aF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68364d17943458cb8db6bec1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5466904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracey D.
