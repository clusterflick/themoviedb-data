Whilst observing their vital signs she tailors her playing to suit each client's personality, state of mind and stage of expiration. Her music allows those who listen to her to enter into the unbinding process of letting go. Alone in her large and sinister house she spends her nights provoked into practice by her majestic concert harp. A lonely and insular figure who's eyes have been shaped by death, Catherine works tirelessly to help those in their final hours let go. Why then can't she bless herself with the same release?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4itu6YzkPI74uxDrLIGLA1KIMy1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Beautiful Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Reid","original_name":"Alex Reid","popularity":2.3568,"profile_path":"/pH5bQpmiMUBXeX6zNZeNN6ieA6N.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Catherine Beaumont","credit_id":"68370b7b1f41be58b9b6d184","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4579314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Cartwright","original_name":"Edward Cartwright","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Peter Blake","credit_id":"68370ba9604f440356730ba6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":175393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Ewans","original_name":"Nick Ewans","popularity":0.5035,"profile_path":"/sDNGQJ30Yb2Ip9YIx3Zui8Opxo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Henry Fogle","credit_id":"68370bb84b131e3159eb4000","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3943255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Will Thomas Freeman","original_name":"Will Thomas Freeman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68370bce380ebee35a730bb0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3943255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Will Thomas Freeman","original_name":"Will Thomas Freeman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68370bdb2d616b90cab6c4aa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4105774,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tom Woffenden","original_name":"Tom Woffenden","popularity":0.0611,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68370bec604f440356730bab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3564642,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Mitchell","original_name":"Chris Mitchell","popularity":0.1077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68370bfc3b0730c63ea87dc5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8464168","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4itu6YzkPI74uxDrLIGLA1KIMy1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
