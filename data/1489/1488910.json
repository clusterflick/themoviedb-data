An animated documentary rendered in plant based inks about a little runner duck who couldn't.  Director’s Statement: Sosuke was one of the first ducks on our farm. Created over the course of seven years, this animated short tells his story. The animation was created using digital rotoscoping (where the animator traces each frame of live action footage to create hand drawn scenes) and then printed onto over 2,400 pieces of printer paper and coloured in inks made by hand from flowers, nuts, vegetables and berries cultivated and foraged on our farm. This is a story about becoming more connected to ecology, about learning to farm, and what animals can teach us. It is told with colours from the landscape, including acorn, black walnut, goldenrod, sunflower, haskap berry, purple cabbage, sumac and more.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sosuke the Duck","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bekky O’Neil","original_name":"Bekky O’Neil","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836f776b8500c9085eb5295","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
