Manipulated 3D scans of archaeological sites from the UAE create the landscape in which augmented-reality creatures coexist with pre-Islamic artifacts, spaceships, dune-bashing cars, desert tents made of crustacean limbs, and militarized cyber-dogs.  Layers of (mis)-translation and defamiliarization, produce this uncanny reality. An excavation site turned abandoned parking lot, becomes a multilayered poke at practices of commercializing history. Ancient artifacts fusing within decaying cars serve as a morphing contemplation between time and material culture. This world oscillates between the familiar and alien, comfort and nausea, rational and absurd.  The vertigo-inducing cinematography features alien, endoscopic, rollercoaster, and drone POV shots. Littered with cross-contamination between scenes, the viewer navigates as though playing a video game.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Petro-Ghareebo: NAUSEA\" by Talal Al Najjar (2023)","title":"Petro-Ghareebo: NAUSEA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5465781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Talal Al Najjar","original_name":"Talal Al Najjar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6835c5b468a13bc03583864c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
