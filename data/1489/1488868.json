Her eyes, a glowing orange, draw him into a world where reality and unreality blur. Little by little, a strange, unexplained, and irreversible bond forms between them. But each encounter leaves a mark on him, a memory that cannot be erased. Guillaume must face the invisible, without knowing whether what he’s seeking is truth or illusion.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/tAlKIADeWlLvInlt9EKT5HjBubh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2026-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Polypharmakos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"πολυφάρμακος","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4310073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ameline Grout","original_name":"Ameline Grout","popularity":0.1801,"profile_path":"/snGcJO0m2inceyvtEq7kdnEOzsX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The woman","credit_id":"6836d6e1edb3e846e5414e7b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5469165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"UNKNOW","original_name":"UNKNOW","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Guillaume Francoeur","credit_id":"68377a3139e3007850eb429f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4310073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ameline Grout","original_name":"Ameline Grout","popularity":0.1801,"profile_path":"/snGcJO0m2inceyvtEq7kdnEOzsX.jpg","credit_id":"6836d7d0cc484ff60deb4047","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4310073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ameline Grout","original_name":"Ameline Grout","popularity":0.1801,"profile_path":"/snGcJO0m2inceyvtEq7kdnEOzsX.jpg","credit_id":"68377ab1226d8b2e862b83db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tAlKIADeWlLvInlt9EKT5HjBubh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":315058,"name":"horror"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
