She spirals as she attempts to reconstruct her shattered relationship by embodying what she believes to be the perfect wife. Her grip on reality begins to slip when she becomes fixated on a mysterious couple living upstairsâ€”a couple that no one else seems to hear or see. As her husband Paul watches helplessly, initially trying to support her, Linda's obsession intensifies, and her behavior becomes increasingly erratic. When Paul finally leaves, unable to bear witness to her descent any longer, Linda fully surrenders to her hallucinations.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/uQRKT2EJfLPK5rGD7bviUZz04jN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"A woman descends into madness when she becomes obsessed with comparing her failed marriage to that of a couple living upstairs.","title":"Every Love Story is a Ghost Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5464460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabella Bazoni","original_name":"Isabella Bazoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6834d528fca5da67032b771c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36397514","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1438,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uQRKT2EJfLPK5rGD7bviUZz04jN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1002}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/premiere-for-every-love-story-is-a-ghost-story-qa-networking-tickets-1371875028139","release_date":"2025-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
