What began as a quiet suspicion-sparked by Mali, Paz's mother, who noticed a striking resemblance between the girls-soon became a dramatic revelation. After several months of anticipation, during which the mothers documented themselves and their daughters, came official confirmation from the state: Michal and Paz, both adopted as infants, are biological sisters born to the same parents. Now, as they celebrate their eighteenth birthday, the two set out on an emotional journey to explore the story of their shared past.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"עוד אחת כמוני","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4220659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tzipi Baider","original_name":"Tzipi Baider","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6835851a707f755c794147eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36988535","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
