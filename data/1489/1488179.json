The expedition lasted 715 days, covering 26,673 kilometers. Bored of Borders captain Kārlis Bardelis is a six-time Guinness World Record holder and has been living in freedom for nine years now, going around the world without an engine, sails, or other aids - only his strength.  In the film, Kārlis Bardelis allows you to closely follow his two-year journey, rowing and living in the Pacific Ocean. “Beyond The Deep” is an open story about emotions, personal experiences, life on a boat, trials with unexpected weather conditions, ships encountered along the way, and the beauty of the natural and animal world. This adventure will allow viewers to experience, marvel, and laugh, seeing islands that, if they wanted, would have to fly 80 hours from Latvia. And will answer the question - how can a person be alone in the ocean without being afraid?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aizsniegt dzelmi: vienatnē pāri Klusajam okeānam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
