From the excellent cast of singers, Jessica Pratt and Eva Mei gave stand-out performances. The opera revolves around a tale of love and intrigue surrounding the main protagonists – the famous Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, her husband Henry II of England, and the fair Rosamund de Clifford. Rosmonda is the quintessential innocent, unaware that the man she loves is the King of England and that she has unwittingly become a rival to the much-feared Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Eleanor, having already had her first marriage annulled for reasons of consanguinity, is unwilling to see her second marriage also fail. Only the faithful page Arturo, secretly in love with Rosmonda, knows that the Queen is aware of her husband’s betrayal; but he too is embroiled in this game of deceit, hoping that he will end up winning the girl.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8TwfMVu2NkGT9p3874kkCZxI9DM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":151,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"opera","title":"Donizetti: Rosmonda d’Inghilterra","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5467730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Pratt","original_name":"Jessica Pratt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rosmonda","credit_id":"6836d3666d7078c861415033","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Mei","original_name":"Eva Mei","popularity":0.1235,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Leonora","credit_id":"6836d39539e3007850eb3e7f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1960910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dario Schmunck","original_name":"Dario Schmunck","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Enrico","credit_id":"6836d3b15b3914339e415161","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1601601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicola Ulivieri","original_name":"Nicola Ulivieri","popularity":0.0977,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Clifford:","credit_id":"6836d3c75b3914339e415169","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2258932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raffaella Lupinacci","original_name":"Raffaella Lupinacci","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Arturo","credit_id":"6836d3df5b3914339e41516d","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":839,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8TwfMVu2NkGT9p3874kkCZxI9DM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":594}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
