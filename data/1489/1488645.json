The documentary appeals to a wide general viewership by addressing the social, cultural, political and personal ramifications of how the federal government allots money to each state, to build prions based on the failure rate of 4th and 5th graders. In America, where half of the 4th grade is reading below grade level and more African-American males are in jail than are in college, Elementary Genocide serves as a striking reminder of a flawed system in need of repair.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rEa4LOgZIZ37Wc2XPqsSuc7GFy4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":263591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rasha Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":263592,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rasha Vision Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The School-to-Prison Pipeline","title":"Elementary Genocide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3618030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umar Johnson","original_name":"Umar Johnson","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":"/cuD2vWBNoIzbHORZg9ROHhfJItl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68363c5c977e78e7aaa87bf6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2398525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boyce Watkins","original_name":"Boyce Watkins","popularity":0.1682,"profile_path":"/eEgwNm1kUo73jCYlPB9EyYeJ2aF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68363c9a079a42e287037f4e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Killer Mike","original_name":"Killer Mike","popularity":1.5303,"profile_path":"/3i9Qw5pEtPb3xvzsEuqFpU779lD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68363ceb70315f34812b7bad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5466904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracey D.
