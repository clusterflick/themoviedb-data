When Ezra, a nomadic documentarian, arrives to capture Soma’s story, his presence stirs something long dormant. Over the course of the filming, the two begin to circle each other—sharing moments that speak louder than words. What begins as a portrait becomes something far more intimate. As Ezra’s departure looms, both must confront what it means to be truly seen — and whether a fleeting moment of connection is enough to change the course of a life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Cumbia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"La Cumbia (Soma)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"La Cumbia [Soma]","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":3778648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damian Terriquez","original_name":"Damian Terriquez","popularity":0.2692,"profile_path":"/hLtn8ABT3k4ylCiwcX6yPd7CmCt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68368029881cc2c11e730865","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1449104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Laino","original_name":"Gloria Laino","popularity":1.2022,"profile_path":"/ll7ALAcxgo0DhFsDqNcwmPb4Bw3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68368030dd07645cc003811f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":210756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miles Szanto","original_name":"Miles Szanto","popularity":0.7495,"profile_path":"/bR6jxybr0a6js1ZC9m6QXupTy89.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"68368038a9ea20aedf037e26","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5467318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Carlos Jr","original_name":"Carlos Carlos Jr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68367fea8f47ed8371b6c11c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5467319,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elle Perfecto","original_name":"Elle Perfecto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68367ffb970b04bba0730a32","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3760873,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ayako Karasawa","original_name":"Ayako Karasawa","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836800a7cfd4c5e9b055feb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5368202,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Flora Wengu Jiang","original_name":"Flora Wengu Jiang","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683680197b6e14e502a87948","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4906351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihika Das","original_name":"Mihika Das","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68368048f6c8d4483b2b7db0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5467320,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joseph Nunez","original_name":"Joseph Nunez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68368055f0b6ebbcb0037e9c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984142,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Morgan Spurr","original_name":"Morgan Spurr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68368061d52d48e4412b7f2a","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360987,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aobo Huang","original_name":"Aobo Huang","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836806b0cb72accea838a8b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5467318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Carlos Jr","original_name":"Carlos Carlos Jr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836807b184eb7fe46a879c6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5467318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Carlos Jr","original_name":"Carlos Carlos Jr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68368086a02850b1b60560eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31987591","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
