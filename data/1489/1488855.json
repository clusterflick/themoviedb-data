Based on a novel by Sir Walter Scott and adapted by librettist Leone Tottola, this rare opera has long been unjustly neglected. The recording features the original version of the score, with the role of Warney entrusted to a tenor (the composer changed the voice to baritone in his 1836 revision). Il castello di Kenilworth was followed by several other successful works that Donizetti similarly based on British history (Maria Stuarda, Anna Bolena, Rosmonda d’Inghilterra, Emilia di Liverpool, Lucia di Lammermoor); it presents the character of Queen Elizabeth I, torn by the inner struggle between a monarch’s duty and a woman’s feelings. The fundamental pivot of the drama is the antagonism between the two female characters who both dwell and suffer in loneliness in a male-dominated world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8Smy5Jp4tgcePiji6c0iyGbXewM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Opera","title":"Donizetti: Il castello di Kenilworth","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1682064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Pratt","original_name":"Jessica Pratt","popularity":0.2666,"profile_path":"/r3MXm90D0oLXigPC7zk9ctVQC68.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Elisabetta","credit_id":"6836d03a94282ee2e4838e9a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmela Remigio","original_name":"Carmela Remigio","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/f0uIxEsmF5B56oz911DCG3t139f.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Amelia","credit_id":"6836d04e13b91a37ca2b8227","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xabier Anduaga","original_name":"Xabier Anduaga","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Leicester","credit_id":"6836d066380ebee35a730a80","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2072675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Pop","original_name":"Stefan Pop","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/yewH4p0hi7zag5b03W46UUwhJYI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Warney","credit_id":"6836d0898ece7a1dae414c62","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dario Russo","original_name":"Dario Russo","popularity":0.1365,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lambourne","credit_id":"6836d0a949d299fbdd2b85da","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5467716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Federica Vitali","original_name":"Federica Vitali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fanny","credit_id":"6836d0cbcd1c8829aa730a2f","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":839,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Smy5Jp4tgcePiji6c0iyGbXewM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":591}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
