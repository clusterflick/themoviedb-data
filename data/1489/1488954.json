Seeing a plane, he perches on it blithely so that he can fly with a motor at last. But the plane has trouble and the pilot ends up taking an unwanted bath in the pond.  That frees the bird of his obsession: he begins to fly naturally again and when a mosquito comes back to make fun of him, he gobbles him up.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":263644,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Chardon","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Bird Who Wanted to be a Motor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5468043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Rhein","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Rhein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6837092508b5907cd8730cea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":239601,"name":"european animation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne Film Festival 1973","release_date":"1973-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
