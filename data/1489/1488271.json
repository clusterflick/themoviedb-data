Barney poses as a slave, part of an effort to construct a replica of the slave cells, before escaping. Phelps poses as a slave trader and Rollin as an Interpol investigator. Finally, Cinnamon will be the bait for the trap. The ruler of the country has a brother who married a British wife, Amara. The brother, if he assumed power, would abolish slavery in the country -- but he has accepted assurances that slavery doesn't exist there. As part of the plan, Willy abducts Amara and she is put in the IMF replica of the slave cell.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":"/8LZwFRc6V33kKnSuwnKumbNHjtt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mission: Impossible - The Slave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Graves","original_name":"Peter Graves","popularity":3.4732,"profile_path":"/bK7Wf7qmKqixhKqzmBX3gNtzFcS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jim Phelps","credit_id":"68359047f6e032a5472b786e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Landau","original_name":"Martin Landau","popularity":3.8663,"profile_path":"/2BkrH2w5W1lbv8YQQeEHX6mYiEX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rollin Hand","credit_id":"683590548e4fa91b3b2b7946","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Bain","original_name":"Barbara Bain","popularity":2.6643,"profile_path":"/jLUoYMqpxaIR2Vc4YmFCjdM0H6s.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cinnamon Carter","credit_id":"68359065e4057d9ee0037ce4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Morris","original_name":"Greg Morris","popularity":1.6636,"profile_path":"/l4pyAMumC6p1V4aqxBra7PWlTvN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Barney Collier","credit_id":"6835907ebc1e644c7a838666","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Lupus","original_name":"Peter Lupus","popularity":1.4078,"profile_path":"/6GxndAwamcoQJqpK5MwYdiYj5be.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Willy Armitage","credit_id":"6835908bcc484ff60deb39d9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee H.
