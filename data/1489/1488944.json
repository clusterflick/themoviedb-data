Set against an erotic backdrop, Unspoken Words spins the tale of AMANDA and ANDRÉ, a couple going on nearly a decade together, who've slipped into the autopilot of marriage. As they navigate this rut, Amanda starts having erotic visions of everyday things, imagining herself interacting with others and living out her fantasies. Fear of losing André keeps Amanda silent.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/vXT0aCMKRDUCFu2KKTX9czQZJzD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unspoken","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5086857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dani Guimarães","original_name":"Dani Guimarães","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"André","credit_id":"683704f3ea961108ed055f66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5468004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Bentz","original_name":"Karen Bentz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Amanda","credit_id":"683705082f025fa43a7309b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3772093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Teixeira","original_name":"Tamara Teixeira","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Cris","credit_id":"683705198a750b1501eb3feb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5468012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas Nery","original_name":"Lucas Nery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Julio","credit_id":"6837052a0e931d3beeb6c2b5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5468014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cal Titanero","original_name":"Cal Titanero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mauro","credit_id":"6837053c881cc2c11e730acc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5000144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula Luppi","original_name":"Paula Luppi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Márcia","credit_id":"68370547dc74bba1a6038175","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5468018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas Malta","original_name":"Lucas Malta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bruno","credit_id":"683705567b6e14e502a87bdc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4983488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juliana Del Rosso","original_name":"Juliana Del Rosso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Erica","credit_id":"683705607b6e14e502a87bdf","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5468022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camila Voluptas","original_name":"Camila Voluptas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Therapist","credit_id":"6837057ac7ff56358beb4036","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640677,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Plinio Scambora","original_name":"Plinio Scambora","popularity":0.054,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683705970a4ecab0d6838e73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640677,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Plinio Scambora","original_name":"Plinio Scambora","popularity":0.054,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683705a43e3a24251c05633b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5468031,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karen Bentz","original_name":"Karen Bentz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683705b9d6983cd2164150bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5468012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas Nery","original_name":"Lucas Nery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683705c83537012a22414eca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640677,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Plinio Scambora","original_name":"Plinio Scambora","popularity":0.054,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683705d7edb3e846e5414f5c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4656956,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Raquel Tejada","original_name":"Raquel Tejada","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683705e5a639fcf1732b8243","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4931423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guilherme Cardoso","original_name":"Guilherme Cardoso","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/26dfU6HdLXEPya8bTuyOG5iKQmm.jpg","credit_id":"683705f28928f411f4eb3e18","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/vXT0aCMKRDUCFu2KKTX9czQZJzD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
