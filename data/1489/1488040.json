Analyzing migration documentaries and investigating in Philadelphia, it examines how temporal precarity is created without human subjects. Bodies on Hold prompts reflection on our relationship with such images and the resulting responsibilities, questioning our position as spectators facing human vulnerability. By blending visual analysis and philosophical reflection, Anat Dan confronts us with our own role in consuming and producing images of suffering, challenging our perceptions of distance and involvement in global crises.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4U5rZ2qm1jvHhXBVSb4Tk9RMygK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2025-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bodies on Hold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5464492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anat Dan","original_name":"Anat Dan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6834d6e1440c078c6bb6ba1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4U5rZ2qm1jvHhXBVSb4Tk9RMygK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":337047,"name":"migration crisis"},{"id":346640,"name":"screen addiction"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIFEQ 2025","release_date":"2025-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
