The title refers to the ​“Theory of Everything”, the holy grail of physics – a single law that would unify the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. It’s a quest in which every step forward also feels like a step backward: to know more is to understand less, a paradox that, for me, also characterizes artistic creation. As in physics, time and light are fundamental to film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toward a Fundamental Theory of Physics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
