Throughout the video, we hear the voice of an elder who recalls the events which resulted in the forced displacement of her community and the impact of diaspora. In the video we see Ciwas tracing veins that run along her limbs like rivers.  During the performance, later Ciwas and other Atayal women engage in an Atayal name exchange ritual, between person and plant. This customary ritual Ciwas employs like the tracing of her bloodline at the reservoir, as a symbolic act for reconnecting with her ancestral land while affirming her identity past, present and future.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Land in the Middle of the Pond","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5466686,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anchi Lin","original_name":"Anchi Lin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836210bb5fd941a5c2b7cb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5466686,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anchi Lin","original_name":"Anchi Lin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683621178928f411f4eb3a48","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5466690,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Liam Morgan","original_name":"Liam Morgan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836215c9f2236b5a7a878b5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5466692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Lin Kingham","original_name":"Julia Lin Kingham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6836218cdc74bba1a6037d46","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
