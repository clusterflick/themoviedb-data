She perceives the world as a decaying, lifeless realm, a reflection of her own internal state. In her delusion, humanity itself has perished, leaving her a solitary phantom in a desolate landscape. Within this morbid reality, a flicker of something unexpected arises: a fragile, almost imperceptible hope. It could be a memory, a fleeting sensation, or even a twisted manifestation of her illness.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5G6eWu8CpJ2Cyjxk0liTj1dLduP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cotard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4600860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikki Hru","original_name":"Nikki Hru","popularity":0.2414,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68367a4113f5a19447055e14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2127107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linnea Hedberg","original_name":"Linnea Hedberg","popularity":0.1243,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68367a4bbc1e644c7a838a4e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5467308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brent Wirfel","original_name":"Brent Wirfel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68367a7c9f2236b5a7a87a7b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2427053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Arturo Cruz Baquero","original_name":"David Arturo Cruz Baquero","popularity":0.1785,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683679e3498f2497a873145b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9663684","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1016,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5G6eWu8CpJ2Cyjxk0liTj1dLduP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":686}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
