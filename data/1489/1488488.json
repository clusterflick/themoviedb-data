Inspired by the aesthetics of old horror movies, it's shot entirely on 16mm black and white film. The Cuco doesn't look a certain way, and it's known by other names depending on the country. Every child who hears the lore imagines it differently so that's why it looks each time it appears on screen.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gTvIW5zVLDslqin3xIWvhISCpTe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Go to sleep child or the Cuco will come and eat you","title":"Or the Cuco Will Come and Eat You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5466199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Modesitt","original_name":"Hannah Modesitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Cuco #1","credit_id":"6835f8f2a642dbf53e2b7c9d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5466200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gia Orozco","original_name":"Gia Orozco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Girl with dog","credit_id":"6835f90af6c8d4483b2b7b71","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5466202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Reiss","original_name":"Sophie Reiss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Walking girl","credit_id":"6835f922dd07645cc0037ea4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5466203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Stajka","original_name":"Jack Stajka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Cuco #2","credit_id":"6835f94873fc3a0939b6bf50","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5466204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donnie","original_name":"Donnie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Cute dog","credit_id":"6835f962a5f2332a317305c5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4905341,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"lucia ximena cordero","original_name":"lucia ximena cordero","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6835f98c3537012a22414a52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4905341,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"lucia ximena cordero","original_name":"lucia ximena cordero","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6835f999f023aa5cffeb3f51","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4905341,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"lucia ximena cordero","original_name":"lucia ximena cordero","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6835f9a549d299fbdd2b8243","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11982804","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vIB0Z7sm4JbQDg4SoEOkowsd2gW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1179,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gTvIW5zVLDslqin3xIWvhISCpTe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":786}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":157955,"name":"childhood"},{"id":242587,"name":"fears"},{"id":256736,"name":"latin america"},{"id":352726,"name":"bogeyman"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
