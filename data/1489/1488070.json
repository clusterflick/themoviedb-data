He would like very much to approach her but he is very very shy. So, in Walter Mitty's style, he takes refuge in his fantasies, in which he finds it easy to be seductive, saving his lady from every possible and imaginable danger.

Except that at times real life surpasses imagination.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eve Without Respite","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Avron","original_name":"Philippe Avron","popularity":0.22,"profile_path":"/qcNXb5Yoa4ZOtigyuWeP1duFfot.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Le Jeune Homme","credit_id":"6834e45e6368702a21b6b9e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gisèle Braunberger","original_name":"Gisèle Braunberger","popularity":0.2182,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"La Jeune Fille","credit_id":"6834e483a32c69e61c0558fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5464590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Guille","original_name":"François Guille","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6834e4bfda04f9deb74146ae","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":3463275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Korber","original_name":"Serge Korber","popularity":0.2118,"profile_path":"/szEjQaQGp8x8rWUu3XSXhgqdfC9.jpg","credit_id":"6834e3b67b6e14e502a8735d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0207240","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1963-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
