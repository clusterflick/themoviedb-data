Sue and Jake go to collect Grandad from the retirement home where he now lives,only to find he has sloped off to the pub again with Scots mate Mac. Sue ends up asking Mac back for dinner though his thick accent creates a language barrier for Karen. Sue's divorced friend Jane is also invited and though the children fail to appreciate her present for them,a goat donated to Oxfam,Pete feels sorry for her and is glad that the Brockmans have given a Christmas to lonely strangers - until a W.P.C. turns up with another old boy who has gone walkabout.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3ZCsHLwMpIBrmozxapU8qMtaRJD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Robbers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Dennis","original_name":"Hugh Dennis","popularity":2.3528,"profile_path":"/7JH7OE7Ln4Wx74BaOYo8yaZ6Rwh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Pete Brockman","credit_id":"683649eb8a750b1501eb3ce0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Skinner","original_name":"Claire Skinner","popularity":2.9147,"profile_path":"/odJEMUo4utv11ylHLmrOgbhUQHZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sue Brockman","credit_id":"683649fb13b91a37ca2b7f74","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyger Drew-Honey","original_name":"Tyger Drew-Honey","popularity":1.0396,"profile_path":"/iDaBVOMsjHOpS363Y2gPwctYKpf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jake Brockman","credit_id":"68364a0a8e4fa91b3b2b7bfd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Roche","original_name":"Daniel Roche","popularity":0.1671,"profile_path":"/f9Tgjyw6sN9WXvzIrss3OTH6l41.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ben Brockman","credit_id":"68364a1c21a485fb6b037fa1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":224878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramona Marquez","original_name":"Ramona Marquez","popularity":0.7428,"profile_path":"/dbuBkY9rmb4RXUKxFljFS2BG6ya.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Karen Brockman","credit_id":"68364a2cdc74bba1a6037ea6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hattie Morahan","original_name":"Hattie Morahan","popularity":2.8587,"profile_path":"/jWamJns0w6Q6KAkBfnbSYy1dPYx.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jane","credit_id":"68364a3a8ece7a1dae4149e2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felicity Montagu","original_name":"Felicity Montagu","popularity":1.5927,"profile_path":"/mXjII1BDYfnfF8AbLpX7sfrW36p.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Bain","credit_id":"68364a508ece7a1dae4149e6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake D'Arcy","original_name":"Jake D'Arcy","popularity":1.1183,"profile_path":"/9l3Df8pcarIFZrUMTTIqdWR1M63.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mack","credit_id":"68364a5e0e931d3beeb6bfbd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Stanton","original_name":"Sophie Stanton","popularity":1.6266,"profile_path":"/5nU4V49LKNKOQ19FJEmBfmg9pMl.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"WPC","credit_id":"68364a6f1f41be58b9b6ce7a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ryall","original_name":"David Ryall","popularity":1.9464,"profile_path":"/plcamLqqwUVggpddwnG3ji3sYpY.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Frank Morrison","credit_id":"68364a9308b5907cd8730960","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1232361,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andy Hamilton","original_name":"Andy Hamilton","popularity":1.3628,"profile_path":"/lKxvXHDRECBeiGCW030tllESDPh.jpg","credit_id":"68364aaeda04f9deb7414d29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Jenkin","original_name":"Guy Jenkin","popularity":1.533,"profile_path":"/7p1qcYOpSQs5ZpdJ8E8hoXWawEm.jpg","credit_id":"68364ac10e931d3beeb6bfc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1576073","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3bCOl3oAYcxYSGuDIVMKnwfkatz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ZCsHLwMpIBrmozxapU8qMtaRJD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
