Festivals, retreats and detox courses promising spiritual wellness are multiplying.  We follow emerging gurus like Unicole, who is convinced she was sent to Earth by aliens to start a new religion and uses social media to gather followers. Meanwhile in Hollywood, Shaman Durek is adored and charges his disciples nearly $1,000 per hour to attend a seance. Thereâ€™s a fine line between a spirituality coach and a professional crook though.  We follow the comeback of James Arthur Ray, sentenced to ten years in prison when three of his members died during a ceremony, as he re-establishes himself on the spirituality circuit in Las Vegas.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New Gurus of the USA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
