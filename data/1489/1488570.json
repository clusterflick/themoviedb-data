But in the summer of 2010, the town was the scene of the biggest drug haul in South Africa's history. In early December 2010, a trio of businessmen is renting a luxury apartment in the heart of the Knysna Quays. The men are planning a trip on their boat, the Toledo, a 42 foot luxury sport fisher. On Friday December 5, the Toledo leaves the marina on a trip into the deep blue. She returns five days later heavily laden. When suspicious police officers search the boat, they find nearly two tons of pure, uncut cocaine.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cocaine Captains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4431218","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
