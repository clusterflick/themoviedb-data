It was a chaotic time full of promise and fear, hope and despair, as the United States rapidly mobilized its military and industrial power. In this program, we see how the government enlisted Hollywood, Tin Pan Alley and Madison Avenue to inspire the American people. With documentaries, movies, music and humor, America's entertainers rallied both civilians and the armed forces for the challenges that lay ahead.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/osAVJAiDtKW73saptosAG2kseCa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":263581,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anthony Potter Productions, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hollywood At War","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Sevareid","original_name":"Eric Sevareid","popularity":0.9517,"profile_path":"/pTZX1OJIi1cRBE2sQoeMmp2VGF6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"68361771977e78e7aaa87b55","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5466540,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Ross Potter","original_name":"Anthony Ross Potter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683617c242e8a4d2df2b7dc0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5133645,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Frank J.
