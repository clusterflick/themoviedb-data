The libretto is based on Victorien Sardou’s play La Haine (Hatred) and the opera features Cilea’s refined orchestral writing inspired by the Russian and French schools, with vocal lines that are varied and rewarding. Opera Today called this production “musically magical”, while Operawire.com extolled the inventive and convincing staging along with Francesco Cilluffo’s compelling musical direction.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/med4RHbVOge9VZh69aX1tfAYPuC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Opera","title":"Cilea: Gloria","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3194469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramaz Chikviladze","original_name":"Ramaz Chikviladze","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Aquilante de’ Bardi","credit_id":"6836ce0a4ff8cd0fc7730a4b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5467701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anastasia Bartoli","original_name":"Anastasia Bartoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Gloria","credit_id":"6836ce31249fc96d95732c1f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5467702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anastasia Bartoli","original_name":"Anastasia Bartoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gloria","credit_id":"6836ce3259374be94e038255","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Vassallo","original_name":"Franco Vassallo","popularity":0.2037,"profile_path":"/xGdVi5bryDF6DkD1BArlmyq3vTF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bardo","credit_id":"6836ce562d616b90cab6c3b0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1576738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Ventre","original_name":"Carlo Ventre","popularity":0.1758,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lionetto de’ Ricci","credit_id":"6836ce757523b33b12a87a30","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5467703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandro Abis","original_name":"Alessandro Abis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Il Vescovo","credit_id":"6836ce99154e691f8a037e83","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2529490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Schirru","original_name":"Elena Schirru","popularity":0.1447,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"La Senese","credit_id":"6836cecbf14f7406a5838cef","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5467705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandro Frabotta","original_name":"Alessandro Frabotta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Il Banditore:","credit_id":"6836ceee5f647053e7055e47","order":7}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":839,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/med4RHbVOge9VZh69aX1tfAYPuC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":592}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
