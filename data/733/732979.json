A wife waits anxiously for her husband to arrive as the curfew looms, a student slowly grows repulsed by the contents of a mandated exam, and an even younger student is reprimanded and forced to recite the national oath by her principal. As the stories unfold, the leading character becomes younger while also, in contrast with her age, slowly developing a sense of agency. What begins as someone simply accepting their fate grows into a character who recognizes and rejects accepted injustice before finally becoming vocal in upholding forgotten virtues.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/97t9KXR5HP9e9PZXbFXicHwUoWD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PAPAPA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Corpuz","original_name":"Ruth Corpuz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f367bba6bdec30033c792a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaja Dapat-Sy","original_name":"Jaja Dapat-Sy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f367bda6bdec30032c6af4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Bernard Garete","original_name":"Marie Bernard Garete","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f367beb33ad8f0038a47c3f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gian Arre","original_name":"Gian Arre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f367c0133ad8f0036a70814","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/97t9KXR5HP9e9PZXbFXicHwUoWD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
