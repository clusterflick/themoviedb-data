It explores his life behind the scenes: how he touched millions of people and changed the face of the Church and the world; how he defended the dignity of mankind. Jon Voight's powerful, Emmy-nominated performance as John Paul II was widely praised, as was Cary Elwes as the young Karol. Shot on location in Rome and Poland in close connection with the Vatican, this is the definitive epic film on the life of Pope John Paul II. DVD includes Spanish subtitles and special sixteen-page collectible booklet.","popularity":0.251,"poster_path":"/fuEKCjKFT2gi7ALISfL1762bjUL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":186,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pope John Paul II","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0475999","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fuEKCjKFT2gi7ALISfL1762bjUL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
