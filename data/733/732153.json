It remains a haunting and a promise. I learned it “by heart,” as the saying goes, and finally made this movie, which is only a way of keeping it with me as memento and keepsake. Using subtle repeats and rest stops for reflection, the poem’s fifteen lines are a narration of self-care, an invitation to do the deep dig of meeting that most unwanted of all visitors. The film is framed by a writer/stand-in who is in search, waiting in the pause between faces. Her writing brings her to a temporary oasis where she can reboot and refresh, invite her many personalities to arrive, and allow old encounters with friends and familiars to flow through her, to become again a living memory.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/aJd8lSnWDmKKN4XMFJiFhzMsZIu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Hoolboom","original_name":"Mike Hoolboom","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/kFXKkmtIUsD5efHwk7h43qaSPSv.jpg","credit_id":"5f334e35a3e4ba0034cd186c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aJd8lSnWDmKKN4XMFJiFhzMsZIu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Crossroads 2020","release_date":"2020-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
