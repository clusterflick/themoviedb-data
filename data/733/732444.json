Subjective experience exists as a dialogical and rhetorical relationship, as something scattered in time and space, emerging and disappearing, resisting language and definition. These works describe the complex, fluctuating, and interdependent relationships between living and non-living entities—relationships that defy linearity and boundaries. My practice is grounded in refusal and resistance to closed definitions and categories such as self/other, human/animal, interior/exterior, living/non-living and in a commitment to an inherent failure to gain knowledge of ourselves and others as the place from which ethics emerge and evolve.","popularity":0.0725,"poster_path":"/2RLkpS1uOHPR47R3QXcEkohhssf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dusty Wave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2740208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eeva Siivonen","original_name":"Eeva Siivonen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3470bb64f7160036a4b5cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1798,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2RLkpS1uOHPR47R3QXcEkohhssf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1199}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Dobra","release_date":"2021-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CROSSROADS","release_date":"2020-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
