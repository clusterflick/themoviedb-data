Kragh, a wealthy industrialist, and his wife Edith are traveling through the hills of Denmark heading toward their weekend retreat, when they see a young girl, Avi, thumbing for a ride. They stop for the girl, and suddenly Max is pulled from the car by two of Avi’s friends, Steen and Jorgen, while Liala watches happily from the other side of the road.
