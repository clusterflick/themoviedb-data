This documentary uncovers the works of some gifted women, while exploring why talent such as theirs was overlooked. We learn that women were denied admission to art school, or if admitted, not allowed to study the human figure. Also, male art historians did not take their work seriously, denying them the recognition they deserved. Rosa Bonheur, Mary Cassatt and Georgia O'Keeffe bear witness to the fact that talent knows no gender. Jane Alexander reads from letters and diaries and Germaine Greer provides wry social commentary.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Artist Was a Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2592475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzanne Bauman","original_name":"Suzanne Bauman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f34f593111da1003764f2ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
