Elephants, antelopes, lions, giraffes and rhinoceros roam freely in the Namib with neither fence nor enclosure, as if at the dawn of time. Management of the protected areas has been entrusted to the local people and in particular to the Himba, the dominant tribe of the desert. Underground there are hidden treasures, diamonds, uranium and iron. From the beginning of the 20th century the Namib has attracted miners from all over the world, with an increasing appetite. Today, new mining projects threaten the ecosystem of the region. Olivia crosses the desert from the South to North, sharing the difficult everyday lives of the people of the desert. Exploring this rich but fragile garden of Eden, she attempts to understand why the survival of the desert is so important to the people and animals that live there.","popularity":0.3625,"poster_path":"/3YM7BKf1rdCOFhkN4r0mfrGI79Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122387,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bonne Pioche Télévision","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eden – In the heart of the red desert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Eden – In the heart of the red desert","type":"International Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Στην καρδιά της ερήμου","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivia Mokiejewski","original_name":"Olivia Mokiejewski","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/g3gdLetHg5qTv7NaxrPtCFxtbPD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (Host)","credit_id":"6019d84dfb3f61003fc9c48c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yann L'Hénoret","original_name":"Yann L'Hénoret","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6223b07efe077a001b9d2230","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivia Mokiejewski","original_name":"Olivia Mokiejewski","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/g3gdLetHg5qTv7NaxrPtCFxtbPD.jpg","credit_id":"5f33be9e8a88b20035a05b0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2214135,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alexandre Sadowsky","original_name":"Alexandre Sadowsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d871e942ee003ff35d75","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545471,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandre Soullier","original_name":"Alexandre Soullier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d867bc86570040b9f668","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivia Mokiejewski","original_name":"Olivia Mokiejewski","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/g3gdLetHg5qTv7NaxrPtCFxtbPD.jpg","credit_id":"6019d85ce942ee003ff35d53","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4799056","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":799,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3YM7BKf1rdCOFhkN4r0mfrGI79Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":9902,"name":"wildlife"},{"id":18034,"name":"desert"},{"id":257318,"name":"threatened ecosystem"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Deutsch\", \"english_name\"=>\"German\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"de\", \"native_name\"=>\"Deutsch\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Franzoesisch\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"Französisch\"}","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
