While narrating a story rooted in its milieu, the film reflects themes of universal concern and takes an insightful look into the age-old evils of gender binaries, religious fundamentalism and communal disharmony plaguing human society even today and is an earnest cinematic appeal to look beyond such myopic glasses of discrimination and celebrate humanity simply as human beings.","popularity":0.0416,"poster_path":"/epvlvMBJXUKoJcy7gP3w39hly0C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91790,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aurora Film Corporation Private Limited","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metamorphosis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2999859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"JANARDAN GHOSH","original_name":"JANARDAN GHOSH","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6066602063d7130058633618","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Subhankar Mohanta","original_name":"Subhankar Mohanta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6066602d0d2f530057a0486d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madhurima Tarafdar","original_name":"Madhurima Tarafdar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60666039724de100582e12e2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3033991,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"K rana pratap","original_name":"K rana pratap","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60665ff3bc2cb30041f2dad0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2693774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rajdeep Paul","original_name":"Rajdeep Paul","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60665f549408ec00587b6e1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386724,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anindit Roy","original_name":"Anindit Roy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606660071e92250041e4bf6c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2693773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarmistha Maiti","original_name":"Sarmistha Maiti","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60665fa263d71300402bd7cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2693775,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anjan Bose","original_name":"Anjan Bose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60665fb39408ec0041479f91","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1615,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/epvlvMBJXUKoJcy7gP3w39hly0C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
