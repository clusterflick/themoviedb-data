They hit it off, share a lot of time together, and some weeks later John proposes marriage. Darla explains that her parents have asked her to only marry a man who has served a religious mission for the LDS Church, and he immediately pledges to become a missionary to allow their dream of a future together to be possible. After 3 months in the mission field, John moves to a new apartment with three other elders. Elder White has just received a \"Dear John\" letter from his girlfriend after a year away from home. The other elders got their letters at 6 months and 8 months respectively. John tells them that he will never get such a letter, but back home Darla is showing off her wedding dress to her girlfriends the day before her marriage to somebody else, and is explaining about her \"romance\" with John. However, in her rationalization, John is a socially inept klutz.","popularity":0.5021,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":138228,"logo_path":null,"name":"JKL Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There are two sides to every love story","title":"Dear John","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2738367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Swenson","original_name":"Robert Swenson","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/rRUCWLfJHkizcOT0RrR3VVb2chX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John Johnson","credit_id":"5f332fdcef8b3200381215da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2739045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brooke Busico","original_name":"Brooke Busico","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Darla","credit_id":"5f33300f29c62600355be448","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2739047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Carpenter","original_name":"Sean Carpenter","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Elder Watts","credit_id":"5f3330270582240035aad3ff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2739048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiffany Fronk","original_name":"Tiffany Fronk","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Stephanie","credit_id":"5f33303929c62600335beb57","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2739049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Singer","original_name":"Dan Singer","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Elder White","credit_id":"5f333047a3e4ba0032ccb3c7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2739050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Thaut Grimmer","original_name":"Jessica Thaut Grimmer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jessica","credit_id":"5f3330538a88b200339dc5a0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2739051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian McFadyen","original_name":"Brian McFadyen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Elder Jones","credit_id":"5f33305e0582240035aad451","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2739052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mandy Miller","original_name":"Mandy Miller","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sheryl","credit_id":"5f33307829c62600365c1634","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Swenson","original_name":"Will Swenson","popularity":0.2289,"profile_path":"/rQWKPsNLScZ5hdYVx6M9mx30t5b.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Tyson","credit_id":"5f3330a129c62600345bedb7","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debbie Nikolaus","original_name":"Debbie Nikolaus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"600f6f31d70594003d26a6a6","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan van Dorn","original_name":"Ryan van Dorn","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"600f6f3bc433ea0040446560","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1896234,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Anne Rose","original_name":"Anne Rose","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c61de463a695013d6edc44","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1896234,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Anne Rose","original_name":"Anne Rose","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c61dcb63e6fb00e12b08be","department":"Directing","job":"Second Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2327477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tyler Keegan","original_name":"Tyler Keegan","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c61d6c95ce24011e59379a","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413832,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kelly Klindt","original_name":"Kelly Klindt","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c61e15eec5b500ad025da1","department":"Lighting","job":"Electrician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413832,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kelly Klindt","original_name":"Kelly Klindt","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c61e1e41aac40fb67ec96a","department":"Camera","job":"Dolly Grip"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2327479,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"K.C.
