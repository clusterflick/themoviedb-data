The Great Reindeer Migration","overview":"A BBC Four Slow Christmas treat follows Norwayâ€™s Sami reindeer herds as they migrate across the mountainous region of Finnmark, far north of the Arctic Circle. The journey, a little over 160 miles, takes the herd a week, travelling north from the inland winter feeding grounds to their coastal summer pastures. The film travels with the Sara family and their herd around the clock as they cross the Arctic wilderness to reach the coastal island of Kvaloya Fala in time for the calves to be born. It is a journey fraught with hazardous weather conditions.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/iUwHg4ORGJtvWyccUuJiv4j4X0H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Aboard!
