This documentary made of archival material explores what lies at the edges of the frames, what rests in the middle of the cuts, what the out of focus and the low definition hide, what stereotypes and codes veils. They are images produced over the last ten years by me and other filmmakers to superficially portrait the forced disappearance of Irina and the political activism of her mother, Blanca Díaz. I wanted to make this inventory, to classify these images, to re-edit them, in order to unveil what they are hiding, to dismantle their regime and to understand how they have crossed Blanca’s life; how to build a life that has been edited by the images.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2019-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inventory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2740783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergio Barón","original_name":"Sergio Barón","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f35126193828e00333d1306","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
