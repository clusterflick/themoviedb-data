The noticeable technique here is “looping.” Bizarre phrases that are like instructions at a meditation center (e.i. “The eye sees the nose/The nose sees the mouth/The mouth sees the navel”) are continuously repeated, starting over when it says “again.” The image displayed with the narration is Object Discovery (2016), a video of water drops on a running car’s window. What responds to the word “again” is not just the narration––a water drop that was running leftward starts to run rightward signaled by the word “again.” This reversed cycle is applied to the whole structure of this video.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vNgURMdUWn6T4RfYMU10IE6g3Fi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Starry Starry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Youngzoo Im","original_name":"Youngzoo Im","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f357ac4111da10035655470","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vNgURMdUWn6T4RfYMU10IE6g3Fi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
