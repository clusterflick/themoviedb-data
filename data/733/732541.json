Their lives exist in the shadows of processions of those passed on, cyclically making their way through the streets of Varanasi to the site where they are to be cremated. Through poetic editing and using minimal dialogue, this film offers a unique observational perspective on the Hindu experience of life and death.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding Moksha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2740675,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karan Boparai","original_name":"Karan Boparai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f34f9588c40f70035f31a00","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2740679,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karen Habib","original_name":"Karen Habib","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f34f97333ad8f0035a257dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2740677,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rohit Rohila","original_name":"Rohit Rohila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f34f96993828e00343dbeb2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2740672,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Pop","original_name":"Adrian Pop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f34f94593828e00323c7dc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2740676,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Taylor Ness","original_name":"Taylor Ness","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f34f96033ad8f0038a237ce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12121220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
