None of the cuts were deadly by themselves, but the combination of them would cause them to die a slow, painful death. In psychology, it refers to small issues that are overlooked until they add up to something too big to ignore. Sometimes I question which version of the phrase is worse.","popularity":0.1353,"poster_path":"/iWpZ9mJqwctSKdYxYuVLZHIHkMG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life
