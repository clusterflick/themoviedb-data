With unprecedented access to the Vatican and the people who live and work there, this is a unique profile of the heart of the Catholic Church and the world's smallest sovereign state.  Archivists reveal the Vatican's secrets, including the signed testimony of Galileo recorded by the Inquisition. A cardinal journeys deep below St Peter's Basilica to inspect the site claimed to be the tomb of the saint himself, and curators share a private viewing of Michelangelo's extraordinary decoration of the Sistine Chapel.  An intriguing behind-the-scenes look at the workings of one of the world's most powerful and mysterious institutions.","popularity":0.4621,"poster_path":"/ogsanxtxUQA5HTSN6lwWJS31I1h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Vatican The Hidden World","title":"Vatican: The Hidden World","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Vaticano: Life Within","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Ladkani","original_name":"Richard Ladkani","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/j5FukcMdsZt4p1mR5c2Po9vI930.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a7ac3a368484e1558bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1075820,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Phil Craig","original_name":"Phil Craig","popularity":0.0566,"profile_path":"/gHNWGvSe10QT7nmifBRtrfQj2Za.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a7ac3a368484e1558c1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1075821,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carol Sennett","original_name":"Carol Sennett","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a7ac3a368484e1558c7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1075822,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jo Kneafsey","original_name":"Jo Kneafsey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a7ac3a368484e1558cd","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2084003","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1072,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iVHlpJoCIkEQQCAvPGcsJs0tHQb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1906}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ogsanxtxUQA5HTSN6lwWJS31I1h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":845}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":716,"name":"vatican (holy see)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"APTA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
