A mother becomes involved with black magic and offers a virgin woman to the Devil in exchange for curing the illness of her only son. A poor laborer is the only man in the village with courage to face a group of guerrilheiros (\"guerrilla ghosts\") that haunt the minds of the locals. A young man is afflicted by fear of reptiles and spiders and the fear of being buried alive. When he undergoes a shocking event, he becomes unresponsive and is mistakenly buried, only to revive in the coffin after burial.","popularity":0.5454,"poster_path":"/4PeKv87X6nGasQLSnRFJTLwOtPH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":251517,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produções
