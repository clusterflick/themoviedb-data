The camera explores the space, choreographing justice procedures and reading the architectural form as if it were a case at the Court. It circulates through different chambers and domains, ending up in the courtroom.  Ruling intends to look into the semiotics of power and what it means to rule today. This procedure is translated into an aesthetic gesture which enhances the timeless architecture of the Supreme Court and its design coherency.","popularity":0.0526,"poster_path":"/btzeD06BgEyLP6qi40DeslwMrs3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229221,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christiaan van Leeuwen","original_name":"Christiaan van Leeuwen","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9340192b9320007b750c87","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2827541,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Alejandro Ramirez","original_name":"Alejandro Ramirez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9340319661fc003384423b","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1714833,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ella van der Woude","original_name":"Ella van der Woude","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/t8kD3e91b4eZbvfArFiNVAYsem7.jpg","credit_id":"5f93407984448e006f99fa3d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2827542,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jordi Beukers","original_name":"Jordi Beukers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9340527c6de30050f25de4","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Digital Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371225,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Petro van Leeuwen","original_name":"Petro van Leeuwen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9340658805510042c1c420","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389429,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sabine Maas","original_name":"Sabine Maas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f93403f7eb5f2007300d06c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2827538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dorian de Rijk","original_name":"Dorian de Rijk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f933feb7c6de3005ef25653","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2827538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dorian de Rijk","original_name":"Dorian de Rijk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9340079661fc0050844577","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/btzeD06BgEyLP6qi40DeslwMrs3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
