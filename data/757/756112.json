Featuring interviews with leading film scholars and visual artists influenced by Le Fanu, Outliving Dracula seeks to redefine Le Fanu's critical importance as an Irish writer whose ghostly traces remain profound and enigmatic. This documentary suggests that Carmilla may perhaps be more radical and transgressive today as a creative wellspring than its successor Dracula.","popularity":0.066,"poster_path":"/idNSeGE0fyybADSyxnQ84Aunyy7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outliving Dracula: Le Fanu's Carmilla","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fergus Daly","original_name":"Fergus Daly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60519cb3848eb90028fb7229","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katherine Waugh","original_name":"Katherine Waugh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60519cbd8c7b0f006bff04b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1325378,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lucien Waugh-Daly","original_name":"Lucien Waugh-Daly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65df240fb39e3501632fa8e4","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2080354","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1150,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/idNSeGE0fyybADSyxnQ84Aunyy7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":766}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
