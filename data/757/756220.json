He returned to the stage of Jazz San Javier in 2003 in the sixth edition and his return was also announced last year, but was thwarted by last minute inconveniences. There is, therefore, much desire to receive again in San Javier this funk and soul giant, who was an essential part of the James Brown band, and also of Parliament Funkadelic, the George Clinton group, before leading his own band, which today is unanimously considered “The best funk band on the planet.” A long awaited return of a legendary musician who is the living essence of funk.","popularity":0.1223,"poster_path":"/A2evajVAQEjngAdVjrSmiiIZuYG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maceo Parker - Jazz San Javier 2019","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maceo Parker","original_name":"Maceo Parker","popularity":0.1604,"profile_path":"/iDYsZ8kLPSsy8YarXqsVEvg7EK6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62c6cbb912c604004ca7579e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1098095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Boyer","original_name":"Greg Boyer","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self - trombone","credit_id":"62c6f030907f260133d0982a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3615158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Boulware","original_name":"Will Boulware","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self - keyboards","credit_id":"62c6f094f29d66005144e28e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3615161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Speight","original_name":"Bruno Speight","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - guitar","credit_id":"62c6f0a8447f9c004e49a35e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3615166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodney 'Skeet' Curtis","original_name":"Rodney 'Skeet' Curtis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self - bass","credit_id":"62c6f0fcf29d660056268b5c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3615179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darliene Parker","original_name":"Darliene Parker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self - backing vocals","credit_id":"62c6f293c68b69004cde6494","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":909,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A2evajVAQEjngAdVjrSmiiIZuYG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":606}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
