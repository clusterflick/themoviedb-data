Ranging from Richard Nixon’s tough-talking, law-and-order campaign in 1968 to Donald Trump’s hyper-macho revival of the same fear-based appeals in 2020, \"The Man Card\" shows how the right has mobilized dominant ideas about manhood and enacted a deliberate strategy to frame Democrats and liberals as soft, brand the Republican Party as the party of “real men,” and position conservatives as defenders of white male power and authority in the face of transformative demographic change and ongoing struggles for racial, gender, and sexual equality.","popularity":0.2797,"poster_path":"/9MUGQGXW2dKT5r8ho3z2YjT2Si0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27072,"logo_path":"/6kSyzXASYqFyD7HVPg32rTsprjd.png","name":"Media Education
