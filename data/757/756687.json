His ambition is about to be realized, for the Count has accepted an urgent invitation to be Schiller's guest. His arrival is hailed with delight by the merchant, who offers the freedom of his home. Bertha, Schiller's daughter, does not experience the same enthusiasm which is manifested by her father. The reason for this is that she has pledged her heart and hand to Franz Rambauld, her sweetheart. The Count's attentions, therefore, are greatly distressing to Bertha. Nevertheless, through her father's insistence, the unfortunate girl is compelled to engage herself to the Count.","popularity":0.2119,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1914-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das Kind ruft","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asta Nielsen","original_name":"Asta Nielsen","popularity":0.1748,"profile_path":"/ngtSkT7QMv0Qy5ZygrqQ72TEGBx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Elana","credit_id":"5f9321b77c6de3005ef226e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Immler","original_name":"Fred Immler","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/mmbbBF6NtSRPlSXjoNhwxvmfUve.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"610d780f323eba002fbf147a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3188748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Agerty","original_name":"Max Agerty","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"610d7815ee43e8007f41bff4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1381745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Scheller","original_name":"Mary Scheller","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"610d781a931ea10046b33a1f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Senta Eichstaedt","original_name":"Senta Eichstaedt","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"610d781f4cbe120081919e77","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Lanser-Rudolf","original_name":"Hans Lanser-Rudolf","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"610d7825ae3843007519d5d1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1071740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Urban Gad","original_name":"Urban Gad","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/26q6LsIRrQWhbd5BiOViA9QjLup.jpg","credit_id":"5f9321da2b9320005074d56f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1071740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Urban Gad","original_name":"Urban Gad","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/26q6LsIRrQWhbd5BiOViA9QjLup.jpg","credit_id":"5f9321cd2a210c006d1657a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0132266","wikidata_id":"Q106716458","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"German\", \"english_name\"=>\"German\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"de\", \"native_name\"=>\"German\"}","note":"","release_date":"1914-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
