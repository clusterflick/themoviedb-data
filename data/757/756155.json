Miles Malleson combines his two great passions: sex and politics. The result is a provocative romance that sizzles with both wit and ideas.  It’s the Roaring 20’s, London. Lady Dare Bellingdon has everything she could want, yet she craves something more. Dare’s man, Sir Major Ronald Clive, is standing for Parliament with the backing of Dare’s father. Clive is a Conservative, of course, but he’s liberal enough to be sleeping with Dare, who’s daring enough to take a lover, but too restless to marry him. Clive’s opponent, Tom Smith is passionate about social justice and understands the joy of having something to believe in. Dare is “the woman between” two candidates who both want to make a better world—until politics become personal, and mudslinging threatens to soil them all.","popularity":0.5168,"poster_path":"/sGSNRQwHCIn1qRsQqFs5xNj0r6p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mint Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conflict","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2825010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Beck","original_name":"Jeremy Beck","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/aoDK0XLiBL1u5ygu0MaNDSdVXTr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tom Smith","credit_id":"5f910bb9761421003689305e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Clarke","original_name":"Henry Clarke","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/pZVn0h5a5WlByGtAI53veGsza0n.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Major Sir Ronald Clive","credit_id":"5f910e9df8aee80035c46492","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graeme Malcolm","original_name":"Graeme Malcolm","popularity":0.1813,"profile_path":"/mWMVqIe4mlJ1vgkbEHAJZgdWiJO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lord Bellingdon","credit_id":"5f910f0c7646fd00332b70e0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2825023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Prendergast","original_name":"James Prendergast","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/1r5NOPi87sNSKS7Qeecmi8iZ5Mr.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Daniells","credit_id":"5f911020c048a90036451717","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2825029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessie Shelton","original_name":"Jessie Shelton","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sSr8eIdBNI4Xu7zFBM57jm7RWlH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Lady Dare Bellingdon","credit_id":"5f911143e7414600399d76b0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1777868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasmin Walker","original_name":"Jasmin Walker","popularity":0.1395,"profile_path":"/H5A3Cq5qizPE5Mq8QAKFBBjE1k.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Tremayne","credit_id":"5f9112ecfed59700384ca768","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amelia White","original_name":"Amelia White","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/5FIzyugTNp1jqKTevEINNI9qZ5R.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Robinson","credit_id":"5f9115c0fed59700395200de","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2708104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jenn Thompson","original_name":"Jenn Thompson","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9108c07646fd00332b53cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miles Malleson","original_name":"Miles Malleson","popularity":0.3331,"profile_path":"/lHJ3Rww0EpSxDMLuA3w71u6n2B.jpg","credit_id":"5f91083d24b3330036efb1d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xec33YWBwTg4f81uzX6EZ4Vy4dH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kHnzxM8qhYwWlsT8eoaQg2F0ufr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9WtxlZpiNIJh1curE2JNnYpqOMI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1288,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sGSNRQwHCIn1qRsQqFs5xNj0r6p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":859}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
