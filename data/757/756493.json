Throughout his forced travels from the Bor copper mine in Serbia to a remote work camp and finally to a mass grave in a Hungarian village, Radnoti was determined to keep writing and to find a way to preserve his poems. The film is at once a love story, an examination of Radnoti’s patriotism, and a sobering view of the Hungarian holocaust. Radnoti’s startlingly original poems are read in translation and, most movingly, in Hungarian.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neither Memory Nor Magic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2089670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Perez","original_name":"Hugo Perez","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f988cfb2f8d0900366d394e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
