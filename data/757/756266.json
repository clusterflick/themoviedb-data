Ten-year-old Stepan, his brother’s stepson, acts as a guide to this grim environment, appropriately filmed in black and white. He strums his guitar, fetches water, or plays kindly with his little half-brother. He also witnesses another side of life. Slightly embarrassed, he gingerly walks around his stepfather sleeping off the drink, soaked his own urine on the kitchen floor. Stepan talks cheerfully about the horrific events of his life, or shares his deeper thoughts.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/Ac5iwK8LDzWpqoFw5nD38WTdfIx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Malchik","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2825618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Akimov","original_name":"Vitaly Akimov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f919ffd383df20034b36e69","department":"Writing","job":"Screenstory"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2825618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Akimov","original_name":"Vitaly Akimov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f91a020278d8a0038378fc5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2825618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Akimov","original_name":"Vitaly Akimov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f919fd24581990033a83e3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2825618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Akimov","original_name":"Vitaly Akimov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f91a010383df20035ac9c6a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2825618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Akimov","original_name":"Vitaly Akimov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f91a00855c1f40039275ca1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14745778","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":849,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/Ac5iwK8LDzWpqoFw5nD38WTdfIx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2020-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Documentary Filmfestival Amsterdam (IDFA)","release_date":"2020-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2020-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"IDFA 2020 | Trailer | A Boy","key":"7jj_llIbY68","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-28T10:32:28.000Z","id":"60b2990357d378002b10d651"}]}}}
