But the only clue he has is that a group of rabbis have been kidnapped. It's the fiendish Dr. Lo-Tov, of course, up to his old tricks, and only with the help of G-d, and some inspired classmates, can Agent Emes stop him and rescue the rabbis - and the world. This episode focuses on the importance of Torah learning, especially among Jewish children. Along the way, it delves into the way in which G-d created the world, and the responsibility the Jewish people have to help to maintain it.","popularity":0.0755,"poster_path":"/xdd53MO0zzMdVaN7AxzquU5DK6Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84690,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reel Jewish
