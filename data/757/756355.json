Вторгнення","overview":"The protagonist researcher Dmytro Gromov and the cameraman Angel Angelov are embarking on a dangerous mission: both are planning to cross about 50 km of inhospitable desert in order to illegally enter the protected hangars of Baikonur and watch the launch of the rocket. The heat of the desert reaches almost 47 degrees Celsius. Dehydration, starvation, physical and psychological exhaustion are not the only difficulties on their way to Baikonur. The guys are risking to be arrested and put in jail if they will be spotted by the Russian military forces, since the Cosmodrome is under the legislation of Russian Federation. In such unfavorable circumstances, the protagonist is discovering his own personality traits that he was not aware of before: in vulnerability and fear, he is now inclined to quit his endeavor altogether. The adrenaline of discovery finally overtakes the fear of getting caught. The investigation of the classified object turns into the exploration of the self.","popularity":0.2259,"poster_path":"/zo7wgKhGSxROkaMy8MwIgzN0iNY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142305,"logo_path":"/kwpAazO9RbKTIPW7UEBbeQEphUA.png","name":"DGTL RLGN","origin_country":"UA"},{"id":139349,"logo_path":"/iLTS9TQuLPYbGCrBYxYHOTd6WiX.png","name":"Ukrainian Cultural Foundation","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breaking into Baikonur","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Вторгнення на Байконур","type":"alternative and festival title"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Байконур.
