Everything is fresh in Eloísa's memory, also that night in 1944 when she became a witness to a secret meeting in the mansion where she worked as a service staff. There was Colonel Juan Domingo Perón fighting a duel with the representatives of the economic power of the time who proposed to condition his actions. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, the staff debated the current employment and political situation.","popularity":0.1848,"poster_path":"/23IORhJrk4EvtF9yvOVEA1AOJut.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2015-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"October
