Viewers see the natural world of the Dakotas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana that Crazy Horse knew. His spiritual nature is discussed, as are his unique qualities as a leader. The final portion of the film examines his role at the Battle of Little Bighorn, his resistance against reservation life, and his violent death at Fort Robinson in 1877. Lakota people share what Crazy Horse means in their world today. The film features original music created for this story. Sharing their insights are Lakota historians Jace DeCory, Donovin Sprague, Wilmer Mesteth and Whitney Recountre.","popularity":0.3556,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tasunke Witko","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Tasunke Witko (Crazy Horse): A Documentary","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2826822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jace DeCory","original_name":"Jace DeCory","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f927d0fec8a430034e690eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2826823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donovin Sprague","original_name":"Donovin Sprague","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f927d16e7414600379f58a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2813289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilmer Mesteth","original_name":"Wilmer Mesteth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f927d1da9b9a40039c83cf4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2826824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Whitney Recountre","original_name":"Whitney Recountre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f927d210499f2003652ecea","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1870532","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":10322,"name":"native american"},{"id":208780,"name":"lakota"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
