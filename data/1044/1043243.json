A documentary about a too-little-known master of world cinema Mikko Niskanen (1929-1990); an epic sketch of the typical 20th century person’s struggles and doubts. Peter von Bagh, ‘a Renaissance man’ and sensitive film adventurer, was the only person to peer inside the soul of this director and his works with great intensity and ardour.","popularity":0.0647,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":173,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Mikko Niskanen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Ohjaaja matkalla ihmiseksi - Mikko Niskasen tarina","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1089713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter von Bagh","original_name":"Peter von Bagh","popularity":0.0783,"profile_path":"/vEjzKg8RCcgvThWOF2qHx9m4eEU.jpg","credit_id":"6361be6807e2810082968e44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1718992","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
