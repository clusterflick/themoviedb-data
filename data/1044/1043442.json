Now in her forties, she’s dying and alone – but determined to record one last album. Money is tight and the odd gig at the local pub doesn’t exactly fill the coffers. When she meets teenage runaway Ruby (Maisie Owens), the pair form an unlikely bond. Angie teaches her to play the guitar and write songs, but despite their closeness Angie just can’t bring herself to tell Ruby the truth about her illness. Marshall’s own songs, and resonant voice, alongside the Newcastle setting, bring a tender authenticity to this rebellious music-driven drama.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/5nIY9PT4hZNQTXvmAN3SvFb3PNS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Chords and the Truth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3768020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Marshall","original_name":"Jackie Marshall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6362d84f07e2810082972da9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3768023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maisie Owens","original_name":"Maisie Owens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6362d8800c3ec80090b6319c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3768024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Heys","original_name":"Matthew Heys","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6362d88d0f5265007c39dc63","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3768026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Blundell","original_name":"Timothy Blundell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6362d8ba0c3ec8007e4fda00","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3768027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leigh Ivin","original_name":"Leigh Ivin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6362d8cd0c3ec8007907e3c4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3768018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Pasvolsky","original_name":"Claire Pasvolsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6362d82969d280007a78aba9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23461456","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1067,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1vKSv19VTSaVUQk3iViapAmTp3E.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1898},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1346,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/52b3Dp1CEaPDxVaNPfOfR6TBuzY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2393}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5nIY9PT4hZNQTXvmAN3SvFb3PNS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9UkonCyAVY7g8hErSxcSAhIwiDA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
