Mini-Doc - Magic Hat Cafe: Building A Sustainable Community","overview":"Evie Lake introduces The Magic Hat Cafe, an anti-food waste cafe in Newcastle. In today’s climate, it’s hard not to worry about waste. Not just our own, but that of supermarkets and suppliers. Is every carrot, potato and piece of meat going to be used? What happens if they’re not? Magic Hat acts on these worries and turns would-be-wasted produce into meals and experiences for people to enjoy.\r Magic Hat is an innovative and progressive organisation in the way that it puts people first. Instead of purchasing your coffee and food, there’s an option to pay it back by working for them for a few hours. They also let people volunteer to learn new skills, to make themselves more employable and, in addition to being an environmentally conscious operation which eradicates waste in their supply chain, their sustainability also feeds directly into the community through food bank donations, education and delicious food.","popularity":1.6704,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":185423,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art Mouse","origin_country":""},{"id":185424,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art Mouse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NARC.
