The animation was shot in the genre of political satire.  The visual solution of the tape proposed by the artist Henrikh Umanskyi is reminiscent of the films of the German expressionist cinema of the 1920s, in particular the legendary film \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920). There, too, the main character was a mad scientist, and the events unfolded in distorted scenery that emphasized the state of insanity.","popularity":0.0767,"poster_path":"/cWP7SwGGhx6tsVp1dWi7RV4zNxq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19997,"logo_path":"/n1XHZgKeOC4GAGcLMAqQSr9Cchz.png","name":"Kyivnaukfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mars XX","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1596225,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anatolii Havrylov","original_name":"Анатолій Гаврилов","popularity":0.1425,"profile_path":"/aWtNuC0IA5bBcpycgMDR6aR48mV.jpg","credit_id":"636169c7b87aec00907e7429","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1944058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iryna Hurvych","original_name":"Ірина Гурвич","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/dOcGH1b8cdgMyj2TKymTqBflkk2.jpg","credit_id":"6361698b590086007e3c2684","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1584953,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Borys Buievskyi","original_name":"Борис Буєвський","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/9IikaUnaR3nvdCaJfn0Tko0vycS.jpg","credit_id":"63a47b4668b1ea008ccedd74","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3728053,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Henrikh Umanskyi","original_name":"Генріх Уманський","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/8qVmxLKCTp3UyzntdICcfy06JSz.jpg","credit_id":"63a47b5320ecaf009fefc85f","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1725754,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Adolf Pedan","original_name":"Адольф Педан","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/gqPYIYFcl5qVmDz7Jn3idcZs9ZG.jpg","credit_id":"646cf64cd1857200e5a5e24a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1627565,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Konstantin Chikin","original_name":"Константин Чикин","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/fFRGWgxGtA0mAgk9dSw5j9rWhLg.jpg","credit_id":"646cf66951e6ab013ab98012","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3345057,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonid Moroz","original_name":"Леонід Мороз","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646cf6ee51e6ab011db4b846","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1944058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iryna Hurvych","original_name":"Ірина Гурвич","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/dOcGH1b8cdgMyj2TKymTqBflkk2.jpg","credit_id":"6485e92699259c00e2f5772b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4085808,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ye.
