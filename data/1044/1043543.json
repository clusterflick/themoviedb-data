In this autobiographical documentary, Peter Mostovoy takes us on his journey from impoverished childhood to award-winning filmmaker. Naively believing that his art could be free from demands of the regime, Mostovoy nevertheless became entangled in the absurdity of Soviet-era politics as an “untrustworthy” Jew. The Red Scarf is a smart blend of animation, archival footage—including clips of Mostovoy’s films—and a healthy dose of humour.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Scarf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3767888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Mostovoy","original_name":"Peter Mostovoy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6362a5d0d207f3008122975a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
