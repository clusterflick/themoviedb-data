Nobody collects them now. He once planted the olive trees. They were his pride and fed the family. Now he sits by the fireplace with his wife. Their hands show the years of hard field work. With a tender gaze, their grandson watches his grandparents cook, argue, take walks. Moving snapshots that coalesce into a life lived, a chronicle of the rural exodus in Italy.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/7xHVnuUz98EqXgnCdteefEYJukS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Fate","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2605623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Sammarco","original_name":"Michele Sammarco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63622d2d07e281007a9d0410","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22782548","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7xHVnuUz98EqXgnCdteefEYJukS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
