How were these men, mostly French and Belgian, some of them actively sought, able to cross Europe and carry out their plans without being worried? Faced with the loopholes revealed by the attacks, fourteen European countries, supported by Europol and Eurojust, the EU's police and judicial cooperation agencies, pooled information and resources on an unprecedented scale to identify and track down the culprits, accomplices and sponsors of these attacks.","popularity":0.0835,"poster_path":"/x6LW0ywOjtb248AYahbcT6MDfDN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75914,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veilleur de Nuit","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":53509,"logo_path":"/xmJMAss7BDsQPvODjYkDQKiNhUX.png","name":"Wrong Men","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"13 novembre 2015 : anatomie d'une instruction","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1378862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christophe Cotteret","original_name":"Christophe Cotteret","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63621ddb0c3ec8007e4f844f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt24229422","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y06kgUPmdUY34JuzFv1ea4ttvEr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1155,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x6LW0ywOjtb248AYahbcT6MDfDN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":770},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/xpeQqjZANqGLschsfmRQ304ah7t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
