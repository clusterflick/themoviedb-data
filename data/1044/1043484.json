He is an officer in the National People’s Army, still young, but with a lot of postings under his belt, always accompanied by his wife. She has resigned herself to her fate, while he flourishes enviably in his profession. Róża Berger-Fiedler spends most of the time by his side, following him in brisk cuts from appointment to appointment. Talking is required and demanded constantly: to representatives of the Soviet armed forces, young recruits, subordinates. Words come easy to him, but not everything runs smoothly.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dialogue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2243151,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Róza Berger-Fiedler","original_name":"Róza Berger-Fiedler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63628a04a6a4c1007a8877f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
