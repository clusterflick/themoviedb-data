Gabriele Denecke’s approach to the men, who are of different ages, is almost trance-like, the movement to and from the stones marks the transition to another world. We hear about the merciless working conditions of the past, about alcohol, people worn out before their time. Today, digging out the massive rocks in the midst of nature also constitutes a degree of freedom. Open cast miners share a special mindset. And: Once you’ve worn out your first pair of wooden shoes, you’ll stay – probably forever.","popularity":0.1028,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once You’ve Worn Out the First Pair of Wooden Shoes …","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1573344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriele Denecke","original_name":"Gabriele Denecke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636282b807e281007a9d3088","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
