Alice Guy was Léon Gaumont's secretary at the beginning of the last century and she was the first woman to ever direct actors in front of the camera. In 1895, the Lumière brothers introduced to the world the \"Cinématographe\", the first camera. Léon Gaumont decided to sell this revolutionary new device. Fascinated, Alice asked her boss for permission to use the camera to make her own films. Mr. Gaumont agreed only under the condition that she “would be able to keep up with her mail.”  This short film is a poetic reverie that Alice Guy might have had in her time if only society at the time hadn't presented her with so many challenges.","popularity":0.2492,"poster_path":"/gWpDvsKal84KXUtmd7VQhP5pboD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice Guy's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3768936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camille Pellicer","original_name":"Camille Pellicer","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Alice Guy","credit_id":"636912cb1684f7007a9be1c5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3768936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camille Pellicer","original_name":"Camille Pellicer","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6363cd86091e62007f5fa7d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gWpDvsKal84KXUtmd7VQhP5pboD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":222228,"name":"cinema history"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Ealing Film Festival 2022","release_date":"2022-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
