Whether melted down as tools of war or warning of danger – “Vivos Voco”, which also teaches us about the craft of bell founding, envelops us in an eery, monumental and epochal way. In her auto-fictional biography, Schütz writes about the collaboration with Osite-Krüger: “The two of us and the film, we were a team, we and the co-determinant images.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vivos Voco – I Call the Living","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3767710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dagnija Osite-Krüger","original_name":"Dagnija Osite-Krüger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636283b37f6c8d007dcd92ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
