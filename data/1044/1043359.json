Every day, Dolly and her colleagues take school kids, goods and travellers on rugged routes from village to village. If you meet oncoming traffic on the way, you get off the rails. If you find holes in the rails, you mend them yourself. The affectionate portrait of a self-organised transport system.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/wfPzT0haP7Xpd9oawoJpX7RpWk2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motorrodillo","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3767440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alba Jaramillo","original_name":"Alba Jaramillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63622e31858678008289dd89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wfPzT0haP7Xpd9oawoJpX7RpWk2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"71.
