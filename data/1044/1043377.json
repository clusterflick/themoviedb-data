During his ordeal between depression, writer’s block, anger and urban loneliness, a story-teller is accompanied by three weird birds who sometimes appear as annoying neighbours, sometimes as inner demons. Jung, Freud and the psychologist Dr. Breuer in the shape of a grey cat promote self-reflection, but the most helpful thing is probably a beer with friends.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World Is a House and There Are Rules in This House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3767470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Leffrank","original_name":"Felix Leffrank","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636239880f5265007c399b2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
