The film was made in 1985, but screened only in 1990 for reasons that even Communist censors found hard to explain. A chicken farm that was very modern for its time included a kindergarten reserved for the employees’ children. The film uses the parallel between raising chicken and human babies as the starting point for a meditation on human nature.","popularity":0.0492,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A movie about chickens and kids.","title":"There Will Come a Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le Jour Viendra","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813212,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elisabeta Zamfirescu","original_name":"Elisabeta Zamfirescu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e0e1e8b77d4b1141f9f4cd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2476103,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Radu Zamfirescu","original_name":"Radu Zamfirescu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e0e1e0e19de90100e8e5ac","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223356,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Otto Urbanski","original_name":"Otto Urbanski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e0e1ca076ce800adce8b3c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3766793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Copel Moscu","original_name":"Copel Moscu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636165b00c3ec8007e4f1882","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
