A place residing in the space in-between fiction and reality, where the potentialities to rewrite histories and think futures are brought together through the characters and their journeys. The woman who escapes the memories of the past by confronting her executioners. The archaeologist who investigates memory so that similar mistakes will not be repeated on the island. The capitalist man who reflects on how he has become the oppressor. The children who energise all the other characters.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/2ZBrBtnRxITucJZagWD2mLLywbY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mónica de Miranda","original_name":"Mónica de Miranda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636137ffa6a4c1007a87b6b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2131381,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Miguel D.
