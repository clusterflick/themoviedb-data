This bone-breaking vulture, exterminated in the Alps at the beginning of the twentieth century, flies over our mountains again. But his return is no coincidence.  Two biologists, one French, the other Swiss, tell us about the mores and the fabulous history of this extraordinary raptor. The Bearded Vulture federates the largest program for the protection and conservation of a bird in Europe. But in the fragile balance of nature nothing is ever gained. What threats still hang over this vulture? A human challenge at the heart of the animal world which shows that, when he wants, man is capable of changing things.","popularity":0.0824,"poster_path":"/3ugMrFGIzduSpmJ2yFbhJ60YZyl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Return of the Bone Breaker","title":"The Fabulous History of the Bearded Vulture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3059336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Lapied","original_name":"Anne Lapied","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63614f5f1dbc88007c560b9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3059337,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Lapied","original_name":"Erik Lapied","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63614f7bbe55b7009818c165","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.736,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ugMrFGIzduSpmJ2yFbhJ60YZyl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
