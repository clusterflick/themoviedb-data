As the camera follows him through his daily routine as a Buddhist and disciple of the Zen teacher, Kyozan Joshu Sasaki Roshi, Cohen reminisces on his life and discusses his decision to live at the Zen Center. Cohen also allows us a glimpse of his archives and waxes eloquent over a meal at Canter’s deli in L.A. A glimpse of the artist as you’ve never seen him before, this documentary is a must for Cohen fans and features a soundtrack of some of his best songs.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leonard Cohen, Portrait of the Artist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armelle Brusq","original_name":"Armelle Brusq","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6362a2b4e18e3f009094d040","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
