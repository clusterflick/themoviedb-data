Sasha Pirker divides this miniature into three movements with different types of sound to accompany the dark image. “Ma” refers to the Japanese concept of negative, empty space. After “me” and “ma” comes the “moon” in the audio form of a rousing music track, whose dynamics build up extreme tension against the image. Now the unfinished film is perhaps finished after all—as a liberated dance under the Moon.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Me and Ma and Everything and Nothing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1403809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sasha Pirker","original_name":"Sasha Pirker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6361bfd61b7294008314721e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
