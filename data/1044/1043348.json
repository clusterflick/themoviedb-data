Her girlfriend, Javiera is a woman of the world; actress, a dancer and philosopher. Despite all of Roberta’s best efforts to avoid it, she finds herself in an awkward situation when she has to introduce her new girlfriend to her conservative mother, Ana.  When Roberta can think of no other way to put off the meeting, she comes up with a bright idea – to go on a small sailboat and leave for a trip with Javiera and Ana, leaving them nowhere to run!  Awkwardness quickly becomes an alliance between the women, thanks to the wine on board and before long they reveal secrets and really get to know one another.  For all those who understand what it is really like to introduce your parents to your partner, A MAP FOR LOVE is a fresh and exciting addition to the new wave of lesbian cinema.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"An intense and compelling study of lesbian love, family relationships and acceptance\" - When Sally Met Sally","title":"A Map For Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
