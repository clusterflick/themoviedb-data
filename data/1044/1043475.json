Assembled as a kind of collage, a round table alternates with stylised passages, while the camera also shows moments in a clinic right before and after the procedure. The attitude vacillates between drama and affirmation of life. Liberal perspectives, with one exception, are left out. Schönemann, together with Tamara Trampe, almost managed to take up the complex issue in a feature film.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":84627,"logo_path":"/74qSw4gEVWDsK1gO0qwwhz2N4Ju.png","name":"Hochschule für Film und Fernsehen der DDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1976-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Having Babies?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1085202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sibylle Schönemann","original_name":"Sibylle Schönemann","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636286ced75bd6007b6eb5ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4717918,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Klemens Piesker","original_name":"Klemens Piesker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66461e445c06e2c6423d744c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273983,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andreas Walter","original_name":"Andreas Walter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66461e9824159ce9d42dbddd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4717920,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Silvia Roeser","original_name":"Silvia Roeser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66461e5ca8faaaac103d75be","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
