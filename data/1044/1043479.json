Somewhat pushy, he seeks out women at the hairdresser’s and in the maternity wear department, joins functionaries in their cars, crashes wedding parties and sneaks into museum tours for children. A revelatory curiosity full of the casually captured mundane drabness that was often revealed more clearly in student films than in comparable DEFA productions.","popularity":0.057,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women in Neuruppin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1169518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karola Hattop","original_name":"Karola Hattop","popularity":0.1346,"profile_path":"/2G1OIEZQOCwHbAWWnl8qRmHOYtW.jpg","credit_id":"636288b907e281007db5d28a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
