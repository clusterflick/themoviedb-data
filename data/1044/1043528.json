In this colourful, rarely-screened adaptation of this dark comedy, Saul Rubinek plays an idealistic young Trotskyist, who gets a job at a cigar-store, a front for a bookie's betting parlour. It is here that he gets a street-wise education in politics, corruption, love and sex. Directed by George Bloomfield (Riel, SCTV), this film features a stellar supporting cast that includes Al Waxman, Marilyn Lightstone, Eugene Levy, Maury Chaykin, Kate Lynch, Suzette Couture, Harvey Atkin, Joe Silver (Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, Shivers), and Paul Soles.","popularity":0.2712,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love on the Nose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Bloomfield","original_name":"George Bloomfield","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63629f71a6a4c1007fbfc4d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
