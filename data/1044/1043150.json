From Ellida Geyra - Israel's first female fiction filmmaker, to contemporary female directors, the film weaves together a conglomerate of women's voices, as they echo each other, clash, and come apart, then culminate in a fiery speech by Ronit Elkabetz. Their stories create a diverse and cinematic patchwork quilt of female directors, providing us with a multifaceted reflection of any woman who wishes for her story to be heard. This is a moving documentary, that will motivate you to get up and do something about the glass ceiling, both the real one, as well as the imagined.","popularity":0.2077,"poster_path":"/fq19RptU0iY0JVxINpNa7ZHSBoE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Director's Chair Sits a Woman","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Esti Almo","original_name":"Esti Almo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63617e558289a0007959326e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":53096,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tova Ascher","original_name":"Tova Ascher","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63617e6c8289a00081bf1ee6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1069223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michal Aviad","original_name":"Michal Aviad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zkw76x9nEC0p6KLrOczOmetownt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63617e7cd75bd6007e71146c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3766942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Smadar Zamir","original_name":"Smadar Zamir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63617e925900861109814479","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Itamar Alcalay","original_name":"Itamar Alcalay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63617ea90c3ec80090b5a7d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651468,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Noy Barak","original_name":"Noy Barak","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63617ebb0c3ec800790723de","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13191856","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fq19RptU0iY0JVxINpNa7ZHSBoE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
