Ever the rebel, Nancy challenged familial and societal norms. At various points of her life, she was married to a Christian, an Orthodox Jew and finally, a Palestinian. As a single mother, Nancy became a leading figure in the Israeli equestrian world, but a chance encounter with horse-loving Palestinians prompted her to establish the first Palestinian equestrian team. Professionally and personally, Zeitlin continues to bridge religious and cultural divisions in Israeli society, through a love of horses.","popularity":0.0954,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"UnReined","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3766951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naomi Guttman-Bass","original_name":"Naomi Guttman-Bass","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63618248858678007a1b85cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1152945,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marcia Rock","original_name":"Marcia Rock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e558dba3d027009f3adbcc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
