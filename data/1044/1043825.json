While giving some poor children an outing on a beach, Ruth meets John Martin (Miles?), a young nouveau riche with no social standing who is snubbed by the aristocratic circles, and begins to visit him secretly. When Ruth visits John to show off a new costume, her father arrives to seek his financial aid. Ruth escapes, but she is observed by Barton, who informs her father. Hamilton insists that Martin marry his daughter, but Ruth refuses to be compromised by her father. Later, however, she consents to marry John, discovering that he really loves her.","popularity":0.2197,"poster_path":"/hed2ru8jC5JDWgIwEVRBQuU4W9i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The romance of a mushroom millionaire and a lovely bud from the social hothouse.","title":"Without Fear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pearl White","original_name":"Pearl White","popularity":0.1344,"profile_path":"/sA7nNWkQbYsRWk3UiuU50lKAIB1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ruth Hamilton","credit_id":"6363ba888289a00081c01bcb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Elliott","original_name":"Robert Elliott","popularity":0.1393,"profile_path":"/qYExhk4bwDE4nTRa3d6n3PLNFdJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John Miles","credit_id":"6363baaf5ca704007db5b1a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Mackay","original_name":"Charles Mackay","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":"/a31hzknewvak5sbfXI0dtbkyEq8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Warren Hamilton","credit_id":"6363babf5ca7040091ed07b0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Burke","original_name":"Marie Burke","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":"/6BN5PXZsScoZGiPMp9EYN011CRO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs Hamilton","credit_id":"6363bb2840d0fe007d4504cd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1003143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Agnew","original_name":"Robert Agnew","popularity":0.1201,"profile_path":"/yDvVDhca5g2HACeOWfhZnqOFIXb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Walter Hamilton","credit_id":"6363bb452b2108007c16447c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1416237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Macey Harlam","original_name":"Macey Harlam","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/6S2WQu6PTCUs1PsnqHNq12Ah8b4.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bill Barton","credit_id":"6363bb6d69d280007a790003","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1386605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Bos","original_name":"Annie Bos","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/6uab6h6wi9UpEJRtuV9hgWZxRaF.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6363bb84091e62008795fabd","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1459274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth S.
