Focusing on the fraught period between 1963 and 1974, when a grief-stricken and then scandal-plagued America was forced to clarify the role of the vice president, the film examines the passage and first uses of the 25th Amendment and offers a fresh and surprising perspective on succession in the executive branch.","popularity":1.0592,"poster_path":"/kfhNbjPPsI6WE7lpA9nEDe23eH6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88739,"logo_path":"/901BwZD3MfPGTAByGndJQBbUGvZ.png","name":"Show of Force","origin_country":"US"},{"id":180375,"logo_path":null,"name":"42nd Paralell FIlms","origin_country":""},{"id":92479,"logo_path":"/xBlCFYbQb8H4ZpIMLco53ybin9L.png","name":"American Experience Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The American Vice President: Rethinking a Political Afterthought","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":451844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Maddow","original_name":"Rachel Maddow","popularity":0.463,"profile_path":"/7gN5KovtwX9l8BSjdTzKMeAd2Ng.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6701819f67c6fb09fff85258","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4982592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Miles","original_name":"Robin Miles","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"670183627830c1301e7d0e91","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4984376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hite","original_name":"James Hite","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6702d0bd67c6fb09fff88f38","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4539594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jared Cohen","original_name":"Jared Cohen","popularity":0.1153,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6702d0dffa3e69e0ef7d492d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4443075,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kate Andersen Brower","original_name":"Kate Andersen Brower","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6702d0f97830c1301e7d4ab5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4984377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramesh Ponnuru","original_name":"Ramesh Ponnuru","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6702d11be48014914685ae4e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4984378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel K.
