(1920), which is set in a factory where robots are built to free humans from work, the term derives from the word robota, meaning forced labor. Barrio relocates R.U.R.’s characters to a contemporary setting sensitive to biopower, class consciousness, identity, and gender fluidity. In Barrio’s interpretation, the agent capable of affecting the human psyche appears in physical form as smoke. Barrio complicates the narrative through a nonlinear narrative structure as well as aesthetic references to Géricault’s painting Raft of the Medusa (1818–1819) and queer night clubs. Continuous with the rest of Barrio’s Material trilogy, this film involves collaborations with different experts including a robotics engineer and a professional bodybuilder.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ROBOTA MML","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4479307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Itziar Barrio","original_name":"Itziar Barrio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f6b6c154da42461f70cb8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4966512,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sara Gallego","original_name":"Sara Gallego","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f6b6dede21a6b78250c42c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
