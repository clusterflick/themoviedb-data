This film was created using archival footage from the Cinematheque de Bretagne and Ciclic Centre-Val de Loire collections. These amateur images were projected onto body fragments molded in plaster, then filmed in Super 8. The plaster strips become the projection surface and traces of memories, in a game of reconstituting the body and its marks.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4965844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manon Tagard","original_name":"Manon Tagard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f6468baa7e5fa202965703","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4965845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Garance Rigoni","original_name":"Garance Rigoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f646a854da42461f70a9e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
