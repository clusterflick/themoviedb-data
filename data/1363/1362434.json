For 30 years, he dedicated his life to water sports and traveled the whole world. At the age of 50, he embarks on a journey that would change his life forever. Since then, Stuzi has lived with a severe disability that challenges him every day. Despite years of therapy, he has to accept that he will never be able to kitesurf again. But one thing has not changed: Stuzi still lives at one of the most popular kitesurfing locations in Germany. The documentary deals with the loss that the former extreme sportsman is still coming to terms with today. He is caught between holding on and letting go of the old Stuzi in a life he never thought he would live. But he doesn't give in so easily, as Stuzi soon sets off on his journey again. Windgeist is a patient portrait of a flourishing life in a sobering reality.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/C6cIZklIdLiYWGufdfg3q3G23z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":203144,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fachhochschule Mainz","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Windgeist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4965005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Esther Miron","original_name":"Esther Miron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f5da4f9928bb5109e58abf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4965006,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Esther Miron","original_name":"Esther Miron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f5da5748834210cfe585b3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4965008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Torben Sch채fer","original_name":"Torben Sch채fer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f5da62393f36fa04bee88c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4965009,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jonas-Danilo Fehr","original_name":"Jonas-Danilo Fehr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f5da7048834210cfe585dc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4965010,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Torben Sch채fer","original_name":"Torben Sch채fer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f5da7b48834210cfe585eb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3390061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antoine Schweitzer","original_name":"Antoine Schweitzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6702bb85c9a10d46ea7d55a3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3907576,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Frick","original_name":"Michael Frick","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6702bb9af3495d72c4f7c316","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3390061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antoine Schweitzer","original_name":"Antoine Schweitzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6702bbc267c6fb09fff88ab3","department":"Crew","job":"Mixing Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4984266,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Goralsky","original_name":"David Goralsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6702bd45c9a10d46ea7d5622","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1655,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/C6cIZklIdLiYWGufdfg3q3G23z.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1169},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ra9Qef703lYzXRdWsA3rsnLgLNf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
