Here he is visited by his daughters Val and Molly, and Molly's husband Harold, and looked after by the ward's two male nurses, Vic and Donald, who are in competition for a promotion. Donald needs the money as he and his girlfriend are trying to buy a house but are having difficulty arranging a mortgage. From the window at which he sits, Mr Wyman can see a wall. He repeatedly pesters Donald with questions about what is on the other side. Donald constructs a fantasy of the future he dreams of with his girlfriend: a house and garden inhabited by a married couple.","popularity":0.8484,"poster_path":"/qunOytoA7lCfMSmEVjvL7PpyTPg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rolling Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1240935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Barrett","original_name":"John Barrett","popularity":0.1799,"profile_path":"/kB7EpVwDuowHaPuy48I0ZPyqWG3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mr. Wyman","credit_id":"66f5a7ed48834210cfe579d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Threlfall","original_name":"David Threlfall","popularity":0.7621,"profile_path":"/9wPLuPJOTCtNddJYNV5GyLkcYD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Donald","credit_id":"66f5a7fd9928bb5109e57ad2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maureen Lipman","original_name":"Maureen Lipman","popularity":0.3746,"profile_path":"/kx26NOAw9GnsHjJIJ4l40YHblJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Val","credit_id":"66f5a806773f0a7aa5d5d1f4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Gallagher","original_name":"Bernard Gallagher","popularity":0.1509,"profile_path":"/hPeDdtzyl1yiKF6stnJbHylXGS8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Harold","credit_id":"66f5a8131892c1c763d5d127","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Foxxe","original_name":"David Foxxe","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Vic","credit_id":"66f5a828be32643d54bedba8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1524766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Doree","original_name":"Jeanne Doree","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"66f5a839773f0a7aa5d5d368","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Heywood","original_name":"Pat Heywood","popularity":0.1936,"profile_path":"/6kSP4YQMHHcHfh20iLOtyvLzLbp.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Molly","credit_id":"66f5a846efcc0ae90dbed9ee","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Quayle","original_name":"Anna Quayle","popularity":0.3292,"profile_path":"/AbwkoWmGWY0PmaOTaLjCQVBfkoO.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Pam","credit_id":"66f5a85448834210cfe579f1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Lucas","original_name":"Isabelle Lucas","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Matron","credit_id":"66f5a862efcc0ae90dbed9fa","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1544428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Pitt","original_name":"Leslie Pitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mr Metcalf","credit_id":"66f5a8709928bb5109e57b0c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Simon","original_name":"Charles Simon","popularity":0.0754,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Ernest","credit_id":"66f5a87c9928bb5109e57b10","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2073504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Molly Veness","original_name":"Molly Veness","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Hannah","credit_id":"66f5a889e1ba10339cd5d150","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1649987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Le White","original_name":"Jack Le White","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Mr. Riscoe","credit_id":"66f5a89befcc0ae90dbeda19","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest C.
