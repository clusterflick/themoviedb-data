Narrated by TV personality Osher Günsberg, 150 captures this seemingly impossible adventure with heart and humour, as one woman battles unavoidable injury, physical exhaustion, and her own mental toughness to run from the top of mainland Australia to the bottom. 6500 kms.  Spanning the most gruelling landscape on the planet, through some of the wildest weather imaginable, this heartwarming documentary celebrates failure, vulnerability, and the pursuit of a childhood dream.
