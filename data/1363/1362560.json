Through forty years of friendship, they have experienced just about everything together. But that was before Derek Chauvin knelt on the neck of George Floyd as Floyd resisted arrest and Chauvin took his life. Tom is white, Byron is black. But that shouldn't matter when they begin discussing the case, should it? After all, facts are facts. Or are they? What starts out as a simple conversation between two buddies discussing the case quickly escalates when their families and businesses are pulled into the maelstrom and are threatened. Will both men stick to their guns when their livelihoods and loved ones are at stake? In the year 2020, in a country that seemed to hate itself, what chance did two childhood friends, one white and one black, from opposite sides of the political spectrum stand at remaining friends? What chance did any of us have?","popularity":0.4671,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":240130,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cap Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Uncivil War: America Divided","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Roebuck","original_name":"Daniel Roebuck","popularity":1.4488,"profile_path":"/y40aX3SdvUZwE7feNq77UMg3zge.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Stuart","credit_id":"66f6278254da42461f70a42e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Musetta Vander","original_name":"Musetta Vander","popularity":0.5293,"profile_path":"/7dW6Zjh81x0Ibb3THwdtX4XXuMg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Beth","credit_id":"66f6278d6cedbed01570a287","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1265329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanya Christiansen","original_name":"Tanya Christiansen","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":"/ciifmUGctpO3zPcazaaAlD8QvJ9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"GiGi","credit_id":"66f627996cedbed01570a29a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1926915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Huff","original_name":"Andrew Huff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f627b9aa7e5fa202965182","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3863491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Siracusa","original_name":"David Siracusa","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/66LmylFTe5bBkBNKBalluqazHQ6.jpg","credit_id":"66f627cbaa7e5fa202965185","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3863491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Siracusa","original_name":"David Siracusa","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/66LmylFTe5bBkBNKBalluqazHQ6.jpg","credit_id":"66f627dbaa7e5fa202965189","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3863491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Siracusa","original_name":"David Siracusa","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/66LmylFTe5bBkBNKBalluqazHQ6.jpg","credit_id":"66f627dfaa7e5fa20296518c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3824843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian A.
