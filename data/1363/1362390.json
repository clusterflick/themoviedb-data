Its brisk pace contrasts with sloppy campness, overacting, and sharp reflections on mortality and solitude. The text and voices in the film reflect a struggle for control over bodies and desires, exploring themes of permeability, the tender and pliable nature of the male physique and the satisfaction derived from the erosion of specific bodily boundaries.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/cji0qK9ngChPwYlvXLHXr83A6Ya.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Furtuna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4964855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Mirutziu","original_name":"Alex Mirutziu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f5c2eebe32643d54bee2cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cji0qK9ngChPwYlvXLHXr83A6Ya.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
