As a result of their work, they were prosecuted and their recordings were censored. Sixty years later, and guided by Emilio Jona, aged 92, the last living member of that group of travellers, we recover the unpublished recordings and reconstruct the journey, today, across an emotional and political landscape, regaining historical memories through these songs, as relevant today as they were then.","popularity":0.0468,"poster_path":"/ovPHHphmOxCTUHYDSIYpZXmxhtp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54706,"logo_path":"/sOid5qnkOOrtbtj0Rdy9D25rJYZ.png","name":"Boogaloo
