Enric Miralles dies at the age of 45 from a brain tumor. The next day he is buried in his masterpiece, the Igualada Cemetery, an unfinished forest-cemetery. From that moment on, his life and his work are inextricably linked.  The film unfolds in variations, following Miralles' own creative method inspired by Giacometti. A search without the possibility of conclusions, as in the extraordinary and complex Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, one of the architect's last works and also one of his magisterial works.","popularity":0.1046,"poster_path":"/k83aUoJml3LnIBeBKa8XyBtRmlr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":220876,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oberon Media","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":150640,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monstro Films","origin_country":""},{"id":211922,"logo_path":"/jXI0xZEJabWaYtfqWxXyKuJJxzX.png","name":"3Cat","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":242661,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmmauti","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Catal√†"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miralles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1665562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Mauti","original_name":"Maria Mauti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f5619c5e354c501273ff80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k83aUoJml3LnIBeBKa8XyBtRmlr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":845}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
