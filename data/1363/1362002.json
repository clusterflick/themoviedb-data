The sepia-coloured screen production conveys warmth of feeling sufficiently without dialogue.  Two countries have been at war or at loggerheads for a long time. There is a small island on their border, and the two countries have built lighthouses on it. But the lighthouse keepers sent there, an old man and a young man, are both gentle people who don't like conflict.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"カジラレ島のふたつの灯台","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
