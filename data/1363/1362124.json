While Marshall Tito was dying in Ljubljana, an outburst of incredible creativity from young people took place in Slovenia, who no longer agreed to the party's one-mindedness. This was the first serious countercultural blow in the former Yugoslavia followed by a “Nazi punk affair” that put the three protagonists of the punk scene in custody. While English punks gathered in pubs, Slovenian punks gathered in the city center on Johnny Rotten Square.","popularity":0.0648,"poster_path":"/BCz2TOsmIDsYpE2pTSZ9e4qzpP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66202,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blade Production","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":124458,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dynamic Arts","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":25077,"logo_path":null,"name":"NaMa Films","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":156935,"logo_path":"/1flX3ViePy3bIruKvBvTxBIcnOH.png","name":"Slovenski filmski center (SFC)","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":82871,"logo_path":"/kQ3bbwVPehXN3M1c64ClJMTuNPr.png","name":"Filmski centar Srbije","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":64275,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bulgarian National Film Center","origin_country":"BG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Punk Under Communist Regime","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1686418,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dušan Moravec","original_name":"Dušan Moravec","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f52ebe9a31289eb5ed4384","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":584967,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrej Košak","original_name":"Andrej Košak","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f52ec29a31289eb5ed4388","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":584967,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrej Košak","original_name":"Andrej Košak","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f52ec89a31289eb5ed4390","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/BCz2TOsmIDsYpE2pTSZ9e4qzpP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
