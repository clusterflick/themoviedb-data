At Brentwood, we already had Ross Jennings along to do support on Friday evening and he also sang Supernatural during Testimony 2.  So it seemed like a cool opportunity to have a 2/3 of D’Virgilio, Morse & Jennings set – we did two songs for the first time before a live audience, Julia and The Weary One!  Of course I had my faithful friends Randy George, Bill Hubauer, Philip Martin, Julie Harrison and Amy Pippin join me – plus Francis Norman who played violin during the main shows came to join us to add a different element to the sounds.  Setlist:\r 1. Open Wide the Flood Gates\r 2. To Love You and Be Alive\r 3. Already There\r 4. More Than I Am (with Talon David)\r 5. Julia (with Ross Jennings)\r 6. The Weary One (with Ross Jennings)\r 7. Canice Cathedral\r 8. Wind at My Back\r 9.
