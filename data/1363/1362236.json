It explores poetic themes of Carmen, particularly as her myth is entangled with the performative fields of flamenco and bullfighting. Like the opera composed by Georges Bizet, these fields evoke the spectacle of death and implicate the spectator as a part of it. This work brings the ritual performance of death (real and imagined) into a conversation with cinema, which bears its own murderous traditions.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Gran Mentira de la Muerte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2382831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rocío Molina","original_name":"Rocío Molina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66f57c364a01d2ba8a7406b0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1144951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wu Tsang","original_name":"Wu Tsang","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/7Pfn74TakjhNe87VOK0I91vpVbe.jpg","credit_id":"66f57b8f4f949c7a5c47f057","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
