Told through the eyes of those most affected by decades of failed drug policy, this film seeks to change the perception of communities of color and to show that many of the people serving time for non-violent drug crimes are not always the hardened criminals people on the outside might imagine. They are sons and fathers, business and family men, just like their white counterparts.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fractured States","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4965163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Tillis","original_name":"Barbara Tillis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66f5ee884e09ce29397e9fab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4965165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virgil Grant","original_name":"Virgil Grant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66f5eea4a10fa495b57e9e4e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4965168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will English-Robinson","original_name":"Will English-Robinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66f5eebafc5eb47b227e9f4d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4965169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corvain Cooper","original_name":"Corvain Cooper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66f5eec7c0a0eab94cfe395a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2614378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joel Woodman","original_name":"Joel Woodman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f5ed28a7fdd54d302fff2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357715,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Justin Benoliel","original_name":"Justin Benoliel","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f5eda255c885f00230001d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222921,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bradley J.
