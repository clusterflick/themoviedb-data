Shot in Toronto and New York City, it features an original soundtrack by Daniel Brlas. With the help of Cullen Ritchie, elements of the footage were purposely distressed to emphasize textual illegibility. This film explains my world – if only I can find the right word.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/72Fad2hk9o3GqMnXa38nO5I9Zjh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phonetic Philmmaking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4324899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rennie Taylor","original_name":"Rennie Taylor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yXikmMWkEYHx1ataUIyvX2KJ9Kf.jpg","credit_id":"680d42a4f97f5cb6b8eac342","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5026097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Brlas","original_name":"Daniel Brlas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680d42bbf97f5cb6b8eac347","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/72Fad2hk9o3GqMnXa38nO5I9Zjh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Premiere at CineCycle in Toronto","release_date":"2025-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
