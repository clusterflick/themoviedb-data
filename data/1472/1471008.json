Air, water and earth tune in to a cycle that begins and ends without anyone noticing. Before, everything was white. Now, it's just a vestige, while time advances and everything transforms. Between the visible and the invisible, everything is on the verge of being born or fading. A murmur in the current. Under the surface of the sea, the sound dissolves, the fish slide like shadows between reflections. The night returns, the stars insist. The light filters between the branches, showing what the gaze does not reach. With each 16mm frame, Pneuma reveals the essence of what persists, inviting us to feel the presence of the invisible that surrounds us.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pneuma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
