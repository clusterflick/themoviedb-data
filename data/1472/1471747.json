This film is an exploration in structural methodology and analog filmmaking techniques. It was photographed with a Bolex H16 Reflex camera over the course of two days with two 100 foot black and white 16mm rolls. The film was then hand processed and scanned to digital. What began as an obsession with a singular subject revealed timely symbolism of the late stage capitalist American landscape.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Hundred White Trucks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5190880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brice Goldberg","original_name":"Brice Goldberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680e59295b2ebd5b9538121e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
