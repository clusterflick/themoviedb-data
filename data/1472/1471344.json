Falun Gong, a method of exercise and meditation was outlawed in China in 1999 by President Jiang Zemin. Since that time it is believed by the Falun Gong, that thousands of followers of this spiritual movement have been sent to Chinese jails. There, they believe many have been tortured and even killed. There are also allegations, contained in a report co-authored by Canadian lawyer David Matas and David Kilgour, former Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific, that Falun Gong practitioners have been victims of organ harvesting in China. Chinese Officials deny all such claims.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Red Wall: The Persecution of Falun Gong","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":152307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Rowe","original_name":"Peter Rowe","popularity":0.1504,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680d626d5b2ebd5b9537c3c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1139657","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
