Navigating the country’s politics and culture the unlikely pair use comedy and the joy of creativity to tell a very personal narrative about Mohand’s longing to return home and his inability to do so. As the UK government increases its hostile legislation towards refugees this film focuses attention on issues of representation and more immediately how we make a dream of home a reality.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97989,"logo_path":"/zsVfzGovuswYjPQAzS2WjA9XhFk.png","name":"Scottish Documentary Institute","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tomorrow That’ll Come","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5400369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carla Shah","original_name":"Carla Shah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680e5f6d3c718e8c5537fb55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5400369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carla Shah","original_name":"Carla Shah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680e5f7f3c718e8c5537fb5f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5400369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carla Shah","original_name":"Carla Shah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680e5f8b5b2ebd5b95381285","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5400372,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rohan Berry Crickmar","original_name":"Rohan Berry Crickmar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680e5f9cbaac1c5a7d812f93","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5400375,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zoë Irvine","original_name":"Zoë Irvine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680e5fbcd80fdf82a7eafaf7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1114918,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Åsa Mossberg","original_name":"Åsa Mossberg","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/vgXEFUjlxBLPDXl8p48LNsVGH6f.jpg","credit_id":"680e5ff4d80fdf82a7eafb0b","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Consultant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
