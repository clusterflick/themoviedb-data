A number of bloopers are part of this piece as well which includes comments from director Rawson Marshall Thurber and actors Jennifer Aniston, Kathryn Hahn, Will Poulter, Emma Roberts, Nick Offerman and Jason Sudeikis. They tell us about the acting/improvisation processes used in the film and we see plenty of alternate takes.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/omFXILTizKu4uUfGil4kfWtzXJt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Millers Unleashed: Outtakes Overload","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Aniston","original_name":"Jennifer Aniston","popularity":11.2801,"profile_path":"/qPXG41rYdUGldZhMhuZFvmpZKRp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"680ec12a10d1e453d2eb1328","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathryn Hahn","original_name":"Kathryn Hahn","popularity":2.8853,"profile_path":"/9sVllAKfEls3SJD3GoPm2JEZoa5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"680ec1334603571ead0f728b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Offerman","original_name":"Nick Offerman","popularity":1.5977,"profile_path":"/zhmWZEJkzqgkIbSqZmFtUm0AwUV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"680ec13c4603571ead0f728f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Poulter","original_name":"Will Poulter","popularity":3.8297,"profile_path":"/9blYMaj79VGC6BHTLmJp3V5S8r3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"680ec143eb1d4b06de0f6f85","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Roberts","original_name":"Emma Roberts","popularity":8.3135,"profile_path":"/1vDYB1rQnELrrMn93J7xbkcnloU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"680ec14c10d1e453d2eb1334","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Sudeikis","original_name":"Jason Sudeikis","popularity":3.0374,"profile_path":"/uuacnP9DOHMsmj8FhBi0cWWDgrn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"680ec1555ad0b67c66eabf32","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rawson Marshall Thurber","original_name":"Rawson Marshall Thurber","popularity":0.3062,"profile_path":"/bFtVBwPGiQfhSbZbZdGFuP1acw1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"680ec162ba241d8aea80d8b4","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5503160","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lZ4ek3cPwgLhcW6Lkh7EzwKsdYn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/omFXILTizKu4uUfGil4kfWtzXJt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1012}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
