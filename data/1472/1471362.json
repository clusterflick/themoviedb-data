What begins as a personal journey soon becomes a meditation on the burden of memory, the silence of survivors, and the complex legacies of war.  As she travels across Vietnam, collecting testimonies and fragments of remembrance, Chi is confronted with what has been left unspoken - in her family and in the fabric of a nation still shaped by conflict.  The film explores what it means to inherit a war you did not live through, and what is remembered when so much has been forgotten.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vietnam: 50 Years of Forgetting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5398908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mai Huy盻］ Chi","original_name":"Mai Huy盻］ Chi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680d70a08077d2580137d366","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657802,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ta Minh Duc","original_name":"Ta Minh Duc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680d710cd80fdf82a7eac74b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5398912,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sam Sapin","original_name":"Sam Sapin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680d711e3c718e8c5537bb70","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5398908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mai Huy盻］ Chi","original_name":"Mai Huy盻］ Chi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680d716bf769f0af6a810000","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
