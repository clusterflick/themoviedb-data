As his business is slowly crushed by giant, online retailers, Frank struggles to make ends meet. His only loyal customer is a spoiled-rotten man-child named Sherman Young. When Frank hits it off with Sherman’s rich, widowed mother (Sheila), he sees a golden opportunity to save Toy Zone… by marrying Sheila and becoming Sherman’s daddy! But Frank soon discovers there’s more to the Youngs than meets the eye, and that being the daddy isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.  The Killer Track. Hear it, and seven days later you die. But it’s just an urban legend, right? Rose is about to find out. When she’s played the song by an alluring stranger, she can’t escape the haunting tune. With time running out, Rose seeks help from a kindly social worker named Duke and a mysterious woman with strange powers, Miss Holloway. Her craft put to the ultimate test, can Miss Holloway save Rose (and all of Hatchetfield) from the Killer
