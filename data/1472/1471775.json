Emma Perkins has her pot farm… and it’s glorious. The only problem? Those checkered-tail nighthawks that keep eating her weed! As the Hatchetfield Honey Festival approaches, Emma and her farmhand/graphic designer, Ziggs, fight to protect Perky’s Buds from malevolent forces who’ll stop at nothing to destroy the farm… or claim it for their own.  Some kids dread it. Others look forward to it all year. That’s right… Abstinence Camp. Where Hatchetfield’s youth are sent to “Just. Say. No!” When nerdy prude Grace Chasity inadvertently starts a rumor about cool & popular Stephanie Lauter, the two find themselves stuck together for the summer. Along with a cast of kooky counselors and fellow campers, they discover the terrible secret of these woods. That something… or someone watches over them. Someone who punishes those that do not abstain. Someone who lumbers. Someone… with an axe!","popularity":0.1214,"poster_path":"/kHXGc8MYRPIQI8WJYRsSCN99YJb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Emma
