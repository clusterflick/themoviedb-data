Will you need a screwdriver? What does an astrophysicist do exactly on any given Tuesday while looking for the edge of the universe?  In 1985 a clueless but educable filmmaker pursues these questions, skips 3 decades, then picks the story up again, 39 years later. COSMIC CODA tells the story—as it happens—of one of the most important discoveries in physics.  Much has changed in the world of astrophysics: more remarkably much has not.
