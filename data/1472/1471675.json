There were things that I wanted to change based on my own personal opinion, but for the most part I just spent 10 months working on this movie to see what I could do to improve what we got. I definitely spent way too long on this, but what can I say? I love Star Wars that much! I did 115 VFX shots for this movie, whether they were small changes or big changes, they were all important to the story I wanted to tell. I want to be very clear, this is my own artistic interpretation, based on my personal opinion and taste. If it resonates with you, then that's awesome. If it doesn't, no worries, rewatching the full show on Disney Plus is always an option!","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/oXYVKswFDIYPoucIeDbfI5xFaWy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ahsoka - The Patterson Cut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":756,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oXYVKswFDIYPoucIeDbfI5xFaWy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
