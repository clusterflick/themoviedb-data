As he watches, sudden and jarring images disrupt the film, gradually overtaking it until they dominate the screen. Captivated, the man rises and approaches the screen, reaching out to touch it. At that moment, the boundary between images and reality blurs, and space-time shifts to Beirut, moments before the catastrophic explosion. Following the explosion, we see the man walking through the ruins of a devastated mansion.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beirooth: Busted","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5400342,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yaan پ Kaaraajyan","original_name":"Yaan پ Kaaraajyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680e5cb9f97f5cb6b8eafd5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
