He intuitively determines the condition of the railway tracks, which are monitored by his son. Every month, a track meter equipped with state-of-the-art technology passes through the stop, but its readings differ from what the old man feels about the road. The son finds himself in a dilemma: which to trust more — his father's intuition or the indications of the computer? After all, the lives of hundreds of passengers depend on the right decision.","popularity":0.0854,"poster_path":"/8gQiiGrN64eYjV9oElje004zZsA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3623,"logo_path":"/v3XJT8ci1OScqcMOqd6uAExJCcV.png","name":"Kazakhfilm Studios","origin_country":"KZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2006-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes of a Wayfarer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Zapiski putevogo obkhodchika","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nurzhuman Ihtymbaev","original_name":"Нұржұман Ықтымбаев","popularity":0.1101,"profile_path":"/roIN2d4gsr2Ex215sJGHYtgcBWf.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"65dc2b7fd46537014acf44fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4558108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinar Chanisbekova","original_name":"Shinar Chanisbekova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"65dc2b8ced2ac201644108ba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4151919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nazgul Karabalina","original_name":"Nazgul Karabalina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"65dc2b95b7b69d017dc8d962","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4558109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rustem Abdolda","original_name":"Rustem Abdolda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"65dc2ba11cc4ff0186fca794","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4558110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nurlan Aibosinov","original_name":"Nurlan Aibosinov","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"65dc2baa1cc4ff0186fca7a8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhanabek Zhetiruov","original_name":"Zhanabek Zhetiruov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc2af01cc4ff0186fca5cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1926285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aldabek Shalbayev","original_name":"Алдабек Шалбаев","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":"/tXfvnhJ8Arq3xn651qHrXOFPP39.jpg","credit_id":"65dc2b55f6fd18016357ace1","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2403175,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Svetlana Niyasoba","original_name":"Svetlana Niyasoba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc2b75c2b9df01838d5793","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1497903,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sergej Azimov","original_name":"Sergej Azimov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc2b491cc4ff0186fca6b7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1926179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arman Assenov","original_name":"Arman Assenov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc2b390752880163b2c4d2","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2607231,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kuat Shildebaev","original_name":"Kuat Shildebaev","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iDaglPcuF5ju3s07w79ofd8W657.jpg","credit_id":"65dc2b6a3dc885018b42a401","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhanabek Zhetiruov","original_name":"Zhanabek Zhetiruov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc2af95f2db10187c015d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079392,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Boris Troshev","original_name":"Boris Troshev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc2b5fd465370165cf85fe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhanabek Zhetiruov","original_name":"Zhanabek Zhetiruov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc2b144539d00186bf51bd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1077106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1320,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8gQiiGrN64eYjV9oElje004zZsA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":924}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
