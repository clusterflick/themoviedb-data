Elite units of the Russian secret services are hidden behind these code names. They are among the most dangerous hackers in the world. The bears were already in the computer of then-Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015, interfered in the US election campaign in 2016 and are currently influencing the war in Ukraine. The makers of the successful YouTube channel “Simplicissimus” in co-production with funk and SWR are back and show the destructive potential of state hacking with this documentary. With the help of leading German hackers, cyberspace experts and a lot of humor, they delicately demystify the Russian bears: Who are the people behind them? How do they operate? And what makes them so incredibly dangerous?","popularity":1.2676,"poster_path":"/4QZ7AW1uppZxxeMayNYdmf4Lvab.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":222569,"logo_path":null,"name":"simplicissimus","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":111979,"logo_path":"/f46vFQtoGaLQgTFGmZTZdC6ZP17.png","name":"Funk","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Putin's
