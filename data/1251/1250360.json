His unorthodox conservationist practices have increased the numbers of the salmon population in the Jarvis Inlet from a modest 500 to 25 000. Using a spade and accompanied by his dog, Frank wades up and down the stream, digging for the newly hatched salmon that lie buried in the gravel. Without his intervention they risk dying before reaching maturity.","popularity":0.0837,"poster_path":"/xGzPJbYgni0No02XZusO0YbgJDm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Digs for Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4557880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Jenkinson","original_name":"Frank Jenkinson","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65dc0008c2b9df01838cef8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4557881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trevor Lautens","original_name":"Trevor Lautens","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"65dc001603bf840161ae3b06","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963379,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jack Long","original_name":"Jack Long","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc01005f2db10187bfbf4a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4557885,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Knight","original_name":"John Knight","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc01a1f6fd18017c57f768","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963379,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jack Long","original_name":"Jack Long","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc00f203bf840184ae98c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4557886,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Al West","original_name":"Al West","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc01c3d465370188cfa882","department":"Sound","job":"Location Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939465,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bruce Giesbrecht","original_name":"Bruce Giesbrecht","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc012bc2b9df01838cf2ea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0226106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eNIHQKzkd46kcqwhe5xPo04SxtI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xGzPJbYgni0No02XZusO0YbgJDm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
