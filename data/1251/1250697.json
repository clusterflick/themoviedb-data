The first handled the streaming text background. It increases the rate at which letters are typed, motion-blurring fast images. The second program generates the running man. Random letters are drawn (according to specified animation parameters), and their color intensity is determined by the pixels covered in the Muybridge images. A sequence of images is read in, and animation parameters are applied to the animatable font.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Today’s Science Tomorrow’s Art","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4559462,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Aaron Otstott","original_name":"Aaron Otstott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dd017fdcb6a3018584f4bf","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4559462,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Aaron Otstott","original_name":"Aaron Otstott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dd01792ac499017dca73af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
