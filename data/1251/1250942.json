Man with a Camera celebrates the life and work of Glasgow's pre-eminent photographer, using some of the 50,000 shots taken over thirty years - a moving portrait of a love affair between a man and his city, and the affection in which he is held today.  Marzaroli's black-and-white photographs have become synonymous with a post-war Scotland in the throes of regeneration. They captured both the aspects of the old, such as the rag-and-bone man in the Gorbals or the cockle gatherers of Barra, and the paraphernalia of the new - cranes, towers and construction at Glasgow's Charing Cross.  As Glasgow's landscape changes once again and the high-rises that Marzaroli documented going up are gradually being razed to the ground, this film celebrates Marzaroli's remarkable photographic legacy.","popularity":0.0981,"poster_path":"/eezGx8EYJ634BqJzwj4fqaOWVf9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oscar Marzaroli - Man with a Camera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254158,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Archer","original_name":"John Archer","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ddb38d39549a01644ee7d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5254840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Ross","original_name":"Brian Ross","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4b5a60d87b4dccb6da89b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h7mmBdnHPXVrYBtz55JuUKHLYvr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eezGx8EYJ634BqJzwj4fqaOWVf9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
