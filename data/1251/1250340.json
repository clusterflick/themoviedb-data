Investigative reporters for publications that include The Daily Maverick and Die Beeld discuss the impact on them of targeted social media negativity, including direct threats to their safety. As one explains, when influential politicians with millions of followers, such as Julius Malema, malign them on social media and call for action, the danger they face is very real. But Ferial Haffajee, Marianne Thamm, Pauli van Wyk, Caryn Dolley, and others like them continue to write about corruption, crime in high places, and state collusion. What motivates them to keep going is relevant to us all.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Section 16","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4557800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malibongwe Tyilo","original_name":"Malibongwe Tyilo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dbf068b7b69d014ac7d8cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4557799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilie Madeleine Gambade","original_name":"Emilie Madeleine Gambade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dbf045c2b9df01638c806a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4557800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malibongwe Tyilo","original_name":"Malibongwe Tyilo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dbf082abf8e20186dd48b5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4557799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilie Madeleine Gambade","original_name":"Emilie Madeleine Gambade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dbf0383dc88500eb418b8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
