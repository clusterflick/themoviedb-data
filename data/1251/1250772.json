About a woman who feeds and treats the outcasts and the homeless, regardless of their nationality and citizenship. She is the only one who does not receive a salary at the Fair Aid Foundation she has organized. There is nothing of the dull employee of the state-owned \"mercy service\" in her behavior. Dr. Lisa is an energetic, funny and charming person who just loves her job very much. The film won the National Cinematography Award \"Nika\" as the Best documentary.
