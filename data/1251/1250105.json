Born to former slaves in Dayton, Ohio, Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872-1906), is best remembered for his poem, \"We Wear the Mask” and for lines from “Sympathy” that became the title of Maya Angelou’s famous autobiography “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.”  Dunbar’s story is also the story of the African American experience around the turn of the century. The man Abolitionist Frederick Douglass called “The most promising young colored man in America” wrote widely published essays critical of Jim Crow Laws, lynching and what was commonly called “The Negro Problem.” Yet, to earn a living, Dunbar worked as an elevator boy and wrote poems and stories utilizing “Plantation Dialect.” He also composed songs for Broadway that bordered on blackface minstrelsy.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/2QGQU8AV3kvAkrjpyY2TtpYck8T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paul Laurence Dunbar: Beyond the Mask","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4556873,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frederick Lewis","original_name":"Frederick Lewis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65db654f9b6e4701860103e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xvSLbxEOqbDhhQ1F5OWOpG6NTOL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1422,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2QGQU8AV3kvAkrjpyY2TtpYck8T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":329220,"name":"paul laurence dunbar"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
