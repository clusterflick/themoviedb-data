In an attempt to pick up the pieces that remain of his broken household, he attempts to shoulder the burden of caring for his mother and maintaining their home, putting aside his own grief to conserve the well-being of his family. But grief isn’t something we can ever truly control, and before long, cracks begin to form in Ryan’s facade.  As Ryan fights this unwinnable battle, he is soon faced with another challenge as his Uncle attempts to reach out. Though at first unclear, we soon understand the distance between the pair as we realise the truth of the man’s past: that he was the driver in the crash that killed his father. As Ryan desperately clings to fragments of his former life, it is only when he is stripped of nearly everything that he realises he must confront his grief head-on and face the haunting demons of his past.","popularity":0.1306,"poster_path":"/qBEnneQoV1GGu5au5c86jbUeWQg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When
