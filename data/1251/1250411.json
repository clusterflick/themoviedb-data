The chief mourner is her ex-husband, Jun. A failed actor, he drifts around Tokyo as a driver for callgirls. He has to clean himself up to lead the ceremony down in the small village in Okayama that KAORU came from. There, he meets a host of eccentric characters, TV people, and KAORU ’s daughter, all of whom have complicated feelings for the recently departed. As can be guessed, the funeral becomes chaotic as people quarrel and fight but the fact that KAORU was loved is not in doubt as nostalgia, bitterness, and affection for the woman come out from each mourner in comic confrontations.","popularity":0.2247,"poster_path":"/xkPAqHBcEdSdylExUMDcK6Cs1AO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Performing Kaoru's Funeral","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2763523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koji Seki","original_name":"関幸治","popularity":0.2268,"profile_path":"/pQdINoA8qFsSMN1LaV40WgF9ELB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65dc3a4e0752880163b2d30e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4558226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kano Ichiki","original_name":"Kano Ichiki","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65dc3a59f6fd180149576852","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1735211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chise Niitsu","original_name":"新津ちせ","popularity":0.3033,"profile_path":"/aslASXWTkftsM9GzBxPegaotTmB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65dc3a631cc4ff0186fcc051","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":226825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asuka Kurosawa","original_name":"黒沢あすか","popularity":1.0085,"profile_path":"/oJHqQxOXkWyUAlidwcylMV26rPn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65dc3a6ed465370188d01607","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daijirô Harada","original_name":"原田大二郎","popularity":0.4547,"profile_path":"/i1r0vuDmUgz7LgqR1qXkP0vO9MH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65dc3a7a3dc8850168421b46","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1780723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noriko Yuasa","original_name":"湯浅典子","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dc3a95c2b9df01838d75e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1696,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/3XiyZp9KDiwnFaiyVS4ZDlZbDMV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2064,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xkPAqHBcEdSdylExUMDcK6Cs1AO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1460}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"Osaka Asian Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
