One traveller on the 120km trek is a female hippo, and we follow as she trudges across the interior, and finally makes it to Linyanti. Her urgency is soon explained. She has the next generation to think about. A classic moment in film, from Journey to the Forgotten River is the duel between a female warthog and some jackal, who are determined to snatch her babies.","popularity":0.1462,"poster_path":"/eS33v2rEKRYSQ0y41cPQKyQq6bO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey to the Forgotten River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beverly Joubert","original_name":"Beverly Joubert","popularity":0.1432,"profile_path":"/k4H4MicpxWV23tGSmiofTNMtcLO.jpg","credit_id":"65dd07813ff2df01870a27c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dereck Joubert","original_name":"Dereck Joubert","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/slM6ykUAMLZknVxSY2pZjM2l3PL.jpg","credit_id":"65dd0754719aeb0162e71102","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3324885,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jay Chattaway","original_name":"Jay Chattaway","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dd076a719aeb017be716dd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dereck Joubert","original_name":"Dereck Joubert","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/slM6ykUAMLZknVxSY2pZjM2l3PL.jpg","credit_id":"65dd078ec433ea01303bc18b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0145862","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eS33v2rEKRYSQ0y41cPQKyQq6bO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1990-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
