The opening lines describe cherry blossoms falling after just blooming, and the disappointment of witnessing their ephemeral nature. This could symbolize the passing of time and the realization that life is transient. The persona mentions someone who was watching the cherry blossoms with regret, suggesting that they were aware of the beauty and brevity of the moment. The chorus, \"Everybody finds love, In the end,\" could imply that despite the fleeting nature of relationships, love ultimately prevails. It suggests that despite the impermanence of romantic connections, everyone will find love in the end. This can be seen as an optimistic message about the resilience of love. Overall, \"Sakura Nagashi\" conveys the delicate and transient nature of life and love, urging listeners to cherish moments, express their emotions, and embrace love despite its impermanence.\r —SongTell","popularity":0.0546,"poster_path":"/kQYmZ21Cc3QYHoemAtvQemRW9kn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hikaru Utada: Sakura Nagashi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naomi Kawase","original_name":"河瀨直美","popularity":0.3904,"profile_path":"/87ETduqOsnFELgm6mkh1URrpDts.jpg","credit_id":"65dd1f9e2ac499017dca856a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28603841","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kQYmZ21Cc3QYHoemAtvQemRW9kn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
