Fishermen began to organize, families chose sides, and violence erupted. The Cajun cast recreates the tumultuous Shrimp War of 1938 in this thrilling film. Though made on a tiny scale, its verisimilitude recalls Victor Fleming’s dramatic 1937 film, Captains Courageous. This film is in Cajun French, though TMDB will not recognize it as a language.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/xj2r3ooEsO2PeK2CP6ubYSFYFkE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"$8.50 a Barrel (Huit Piastres et Demie!)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Glen Pitre","original_name":"Glen Pitre","popularity":0.0622,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dbf55303bf840184ae7312","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1610,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xj2r3ooEsO2PeK2CP6ubYSFYFkE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1132}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
