It is generally believed that \"it's good for a Russian, then death for a German,\" but Misha's family has become so Russified that it does not fit the saying. Klus is a representative of one of the rarest professions on earth – a shipwrecker. Klus, who works in the wild frost, like other frostbitten people, dreams of going to the sea with his son Sasha.
