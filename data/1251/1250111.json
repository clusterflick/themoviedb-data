One day, luck turns its back on him: the bank demands repayment of the loan, the debt collectors are running around on his heels, and the apartment turns out to be secured. That's when it's time to remember about family traditions, because Vano is a descendant of the famous dynasty of Georgian winemakers. However, there are only grapes in the arsenal, a rented apartment and a bathtub in it, and the main secret of winemaking is completely forgotten.","popularity":0.1241,"poster_path":"/wLq9X3yvndxGT4UL6n7sj2Ghnp8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":204195,"logo_path":null,"name":"AP Entertainment","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2023-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anna and Vano.
