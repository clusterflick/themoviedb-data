A natural disaster so mesmerizing you can't look away from the tragedy. Based on true events-  The film explores the haunting societal pressures of achieving the Black American dream, told in the POV of 10 year old TJ revisiting his family's home that's up for sale. By empowering this Black boy in this film with the agency to imagine, TJ, through his own journey, finds a way to process and come to terms with his family's divorce. It's important for every Black child out there enduring the same foreign emotions to know that it's okay to feel them, and affirm that there is a future trajectory forward out of the initial destruction.","popularity":0.6675,"poster_path":"/qVpRs9dIRovkyzv4lTVX7s1UtCc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":221916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harlem Renaissance Productions
