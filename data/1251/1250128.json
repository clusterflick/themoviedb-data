Composed for the marriage of the Dauphin Louis, son of Louis XV, to the Infanta Maria Teresa of Spain, it was first performed at Versailles in 1745 and became an instant hit.  The plot revolves around the ugly and conceited frog Platée, the victim of a machination of the gods who make her believe that she is loved by Jupiter. Is this Rameau mocking Princess Maria Teresa of Spain – reputedly a woman of little beauty? Or the French court, which saw itself as a new Olympus?  This classic production from the Opéra national de Paris by Marc Minkowski and Laurent Pelly returns to the stage with an entirely new cast, featuring Julie Fuchs, Mathias Vidal, Jean Teitgen and Lawrence Brownlee in the title-role.","popularity":0.1173,"poster_path":"/ux11c10tHw9poSr5OAyRMpLD7OL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":153,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Platée (Palais Garnier)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Brownlee","original_name":"Lawrence Brownlee","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66cc14e7a54558bc026eb16a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1755306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Fuchs","original_name":"Julie Fuchs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/32KiHf2k0MXWtMXTdBJXpvSmfri.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66cc151a49094360193eda13","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathias Vidal","original_name":"Mathias Vidal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66cc153c7954df0036206b1e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Teitgen","original_name":"Jean Teitgen","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66cc155b94dabbb04d5f19c9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362229,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Philippe Rameau","original_name":"Jean-Philippe Rameau","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cc14a1a7d8ac5c72d402f6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Minkowski","original_name":"Marc Minkowski","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/o5Az1vnk5zowbyj37xLwNqYMmB7.jpg","credit_id":"66cc14b4dac53fd789329ab3","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1023668,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chantal Thomas","original_name":"Chantal Thomas","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6751d2d91234b99a9473e9a4","department":"Art","job":"Settings"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Pelly","original_name":"Laurent Pelly","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6751d2e4871a42c9c24516b5","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François-René Martin","original_name":"François-René Martin","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6751d2f072d1a8a59c298a3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ux11c10tHw9poSr5OAyRMpLD7OL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qTFnAnRvLtmHTkqKi9jXSSvix9J.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":812}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
