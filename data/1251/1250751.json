Years of litigation with a neighboring collective farm led to the decline of their family farm. The attempt of the children of Alexei, Nadezhda and Tatyana to revive life on the farm failed, and the younger Orlovskys are forced to finally move to the city. It is not easy for former farmers to find themselves in a city life that is alien to them.
