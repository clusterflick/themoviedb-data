The question is on the tip of your tongue, and we're here to answer it with seven great video clips combined as a single presentation! Memories will take you along on a tour of the preservation effort, beginning with the first clip filmed in 1981 just after the initial restoration. The Carousel's grandeur becomes even more spectacular as you watch its appearance change over the years; can you even believe the platform was once battleship gray? And when the clips are finished, the show goes on with marvelous slides of the Carousel animals at the end! This video isn't a silent movie, by any means. It is punctuated by periodic sounds of marches and waltzes as performed by the Carousel's unique and magnificent Wurlitzer Monster Military Band Organ, which also plays throughout the closing slide show.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/zlEWHV5NBqJXFAsOWLzRvE5flsk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kit Carson County Carousel Memories: 1981 On...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zlEWHV5NBqJXFAsOWLzRvE5flsk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
