About half of the children did not survive. In November 1961, it turned out that the sleeping pill and sedative Contergan was responsible for the disabilities. The active ingredient thalidomide had disrupted the growth process of the children in the womb in the early stages of pregnancy. In this documentary, parents of the so-called \"Contergan children\" tell how they experienced the tragedy.","popularity":0.2461,"poster_path":"/8Z3EXNIfHy3z5rOwiXfPdg5zSsy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":200392,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bundesverband
