A first-person narration traces Méliès' early interests in drawing and magic shows. He builds a studio and constructs his own camera-projector, recruits dancers from the opera and actors from the cinema to make a variety of films that tell whole stories: histories, dramas, documentaries, and ads. He moves from farce into sophisticated comedies, developing cinematic tricks (dissolves, split screens, and double exposure) to create artificially-arranged scenes. Then, the cinema passes him by, and he lives the last years of his life in poverty, selling toys out of a shop near the Montparnasse train station, with Jeanne d'Alcy his star.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Georges Méliès: Cinema Magician","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0439585","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
