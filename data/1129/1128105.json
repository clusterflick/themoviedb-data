This has nothing to do with ownership or possession: it means constructing, defending and watching over them. True custodians can be recognised due to their deep understanding of the areas in which they live and work, acquired first of all from their parentsâ€™ lessons and then from careful observation, dedication and effort. It is an awareness of places carved into their faces and hands, etched into their memories and souls.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/k4Ti1FPcz5CtZx3Fd1TwpK3GShi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Custodians","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4066798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Rossitti","original_name":"Marco Rossitti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6464a3089f37b0017d582504","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28221070","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2835,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/k4Ti1FPcz5CtZx3Fd1TwpK3GShi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Trento Film Festival","release_date":"2023-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Edera Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Lessinia Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
