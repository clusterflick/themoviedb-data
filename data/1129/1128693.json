Lod/Lydd is a “mixed” city inhabited by Arabs and Jews who live side by side in a strained coexistence. In May 2021, two of these three people lost their lives and and one regained hers — thanks to an unlikely organ transplant. The outpouring of love, anger, forgiveness and sorrow that follows in their wake is a ray of light that offsets a collective state of mourning with no end in sight.","popularity":0.4798,"poster_path":"/g8cm1bpWb9QSVmeyS17FvPQguXG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98581,"logo_path":"/hBdrELohVfCJtSsy77kxx5QH4V3.png","name":"Medalia Productions","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":147938,"logo_path":"/5USotp1QuLWIHaJM4p6ODbuTB40.png","name":"MTV Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2023-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mourning in Lod","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683815,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hanna Abu Saada","original_name":"Hanna Abu Saada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6519def0c50ad200c91bac8b","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2589877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Doron Djerassi","original_name":"Doron Djerassi","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6519df07ea84c7014efc2b34","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932223,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erez Laufer","original_name":"Erez Laufer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6519defaa199a600c49e71da","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683815,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hanna Abu Saada","original_name":"Hanna Abu Saada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6519df1cc50ad200c91bac98","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3058326,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Liza Burnett Fefferman","original_name":"Liza Burnett Fefferman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6519ded4c50ad2014dce08df","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1711853,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nina L.
