Upon arrival, he is met by his estranged father Jim, an ex-director of the Ministry of Defence, his ex-wife, her new husband and Robâ€™s two young daughters. Jim explains that a global nuclear event is imminent and invites Rob to join them in a bunker beneath the house. Rob rejects the invitation and attempts to leave just as the bombs begin to fall - he has no place or purpose in this new reality. However, when an anarchic gang of ex-soldiers take control of the bunker, his skills and dangerous mindset become the very thing the family needs.","popularity":0.1118,"poster_path":"/6VB3hkKgTaWPOfKIH6zR6Ilv4AF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Shelter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1898266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ant Middleton","original_name":"Ant Middleton","popularity":0.2023,"profile_path":"/5jRbUiPrSx8pdk55wWujH4pGaLY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rob Shaw","credit_id":"64649b4476eecf013dd1887a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2170972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Vickers","original_name":"Scott Vickers","popularity":0.1505,"profile_path":"/oOJFcd5Au7FbRWxFPVZEk9aRnIA.jpg","credit_id":"64649b6ed05a030153abfb44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2170972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Vickers","original_name":"Scott Vickers","popularity":0.1505,"profile_path":"/oOJFcd5Au7FbRWxFPVZEk9aRnIA.jpg","credit_id":"64649b7644a4240124de7985","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":2159,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A8ogWiwKrWUjJmsqF7noJEollRd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":2970,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6VB3hkKgTaWPOfKIH6zR6Ilv4AF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":2971,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zfWoGMddUC8NfP7fZVTZYC1TYAX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
