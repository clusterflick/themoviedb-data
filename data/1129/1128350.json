Shchedryk's well-wishing lyrics tell the tale of a swallow flying between households, proclaiming the plentiful year that the family will have, inspiration for the tale of Little Wings, which follows a lonesome swallow's adventure to guide carol singers to a family in need of renewed hope. The allegorical 2D handcrafted animation uses Ukrainian culture and creativity to inspire hope and joy in all.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/4KpNPYQs0IgqhMxvMrvNPsaOZL6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Wings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Little Wings.
