A gang has taken it over and charges a toll to go through it. When one rancher doesn't have enough money to pay the toll, he winds up dead. A local rancher, Bill Bowers, investigates the killing, but his neighbor and rival Molly Spellman decides to take her cattle around the pass instead of through it to avoid the toll. The gangsters kidnap her, and Bill gathers the other ranchers in the area for a final showdown with the gang.","popularity":0.2595,"poster_path":"/9Z2WXuZ7W2O3OyAJZoG6pXKpL9Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aywon Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Western Racketeers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Cody","original_name":"Bill Cody","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/lHXckDgI44PxhXjz8KpH8lrKFLc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bill Bowers","credit_id":"6467731a2bcf670155822370","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna Aslin","original_name":"Edna Aslin","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":"/cYMNGbuCOFc57p5eYUO76gJA5Ym.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Molly Spellman","credit_id":"6467732c33a37600e679dd70","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Taliaferro","original_name":"Hal Taliaferro","popularity":0.2491,"profile_path":"/xAg9Rx5g3M58oPE46eD6yJK9ea5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sheriff Rawlings","credit_id":"6467733c006b010147e94984","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Chesebro","original_name":"George Chesebro","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/s8A5WerpnAjIom4ezjiTEcDEOc4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Fargo Roberts","credit_id":"6467734f33a3760175d232a6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Cramer","original_name":"Richard Cramer","popularity":0.2818,"profile_path":"/7l1v1CPGqfi7lHvdj5Jpl7Tx8E9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Coroner","credit_id":"6467736233a3760101fa3af3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bud Osborne","original_name":"Bud Osborne","popularity":0.2377,"profile_path":"/82VGN2TkLz85qDLBXqrEykjsNWW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Blackie - Henchman","credit_id":"64677373006b0101684b13a7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Clark","original_name":"Frank Clark","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Steve Harding / Tiny Harding","credit_id":"647777cc17497300c1309bf3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4090454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Dwaine","original_name":"Tom Dwaine","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mullins","credit_id":"647777e3cf4b8b00a875e790","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":990401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Corbett","original_name":"Ben Corbett","popularity":0.4438,"profile_path":"/uiNtmH7YdMN2Kk7rITkztgpJUR4.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"647777fa076ce801079b1658","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4090455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Sands","original_name":"Robert Sands","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Sam Spellman","credit_id":"6477781493828e00a762c230","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Franey","original_name":"Billy Franey","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/k1NKW0GxaRTqpe6UOGWeDcnxXrR.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"The Informer","credit_id":"6477782a0e29a200dcb90fe1","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":956815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilbert Holmes","original_name":"Gilbert Holmes","popularity":0.1645,"profile_path":"/rnpZAUhrfA83uBvS4TqJ4dRuqaS.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Breed Morgan","credit_id":"6477783ee323f301274fd6c0","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":88769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert J.
