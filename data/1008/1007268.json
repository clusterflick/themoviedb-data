In 2015, I also began my correspondence with the Brussels-based Sound-Artist Unenthüllte, who eventually composed four twenty-minute pieces for this work and has to be regarded as my sole artistic collaborator in this sense. My cinematographic concept was clearly outlined from the beginning: The duration of each shot is exactly 1 minute. Only two elements diverge from this primary premise: The Seventeen Minute Prelude, Created In Post-Production (2020-2022), And The Slow Motion Sequences Involving My Voice-Over, Which Linger In The Heart And At The End Of The Work.","popularity":0.3015,"poster_path":"/l31u1XHeYTYQrGtcTWdecdExD4s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A „No Budget Feature-Length Experimental-Film“","title":"Transfragmentation","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646192,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Unenthüllte","original_name":"Unenthüllte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e8653f308131006086348a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Zander","original_name":"Daniel Zander","popularity":0.1063,"profile_path":"/3C45RAMeqL12Pp18qsNnwOuY75x.jpg","credit_id":"62e864a21bf266005a614362","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Zander","original_name":"Daniel Zander","popularity":0.1063,"profile_path":"/3C45RAMeqL12Pp18qsNnwOuY75x.jpg","credit_id":"62e8647b2938350058ca911c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Zander","original_name":"Daniel Zander","popularity":0.1063,"profile_path":"/3C45RAMeqL12Pp18qsNnwOuY75x.jpg","credit_id":"62e86444fdf8b70061eb55fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Zander","original_name":"Daniel Zander","popularity":0.1063,"profile_path":"/3C45RAMeqL12Pp18qsNnwOuY75x.jpg","credit_id":"62e864bc7caa47005e86c7c3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"DanielZander16"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l31u1XHeYTYQrGtcTWdecdExD4s.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2112,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTs5x7tAA1i0P22OIBJm5LkSGT3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1408}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1706,"name":"experiment"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"},{"id":293118,"name":"experimental music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Transfragmentation\"-Trailer","key":"54uPQ9wEpKI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-03-04T19:12:08.000Z","id":"64afc7fce24b935b30a2d2ad"}]}}}
