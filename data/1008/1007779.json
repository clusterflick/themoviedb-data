The doctor urges that she be taken immediately to another climate, and Rock, unable to get an advance on his pay, is desperate. He has been in the habit of taking the deposits to the bank every Saturday, and then going direct from the bank home. He determines that week to steal the money. On Saturday Rock is followed on the street by a couple of crooks. He goes into a telephone booth to phone his daughter May and her fianc√©, a young physician, that they can start south with the younger sister at once. Taking the money out of the bank satchel, he stuffs it in his inside vest pocket and leaves with the empty bag in his hand. He goes down an alleyway to get rid of the satchel, but is assaulted by the gunmen and the bag taken from him.","popularity":0.2635,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":90606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reliance Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Availing Prayer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Gish","original_name":"Dorothy Gish","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/pawOaoP0uk1NZ5vDLizFohzx6Tn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"May Rock","credit_id":"62e977c7965220005d2634b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raoul Walsh","original_name":"Raoul Walsh","popularity":0.334,"profile_path":"/qwQVJ66JvChRPIFtLtSy8DkCnKW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Doctor","credit_id":"62e97806fc5f060059c4523a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spottiswoode Aitken","original_name":"Spottiswoode Aitken","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":"/oxtS8L2eigbXalqO9XDTPlz8YQA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"William Rock","credit_id":"62e97815e61e6d0062f1e563","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Burns","original_name":"Bob Burns","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/xqajGPjd1X6JpigS9tJaeNc59pr.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62e97828f1b5710059576d34","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John P.
