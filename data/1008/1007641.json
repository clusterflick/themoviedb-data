A competing plane company is seeking the same Army contract as Bentley, and offers a $500 bonus to their publicity woman Marge Stevens if she can entice Joe into quitting Bentley to join their company. When Joe takes repeated unnecessary risks in the air, Bentley fires him and Joe goes to work for the competitor. He almost loses his life when the inferior plane he is testing fails to function at a high altitude, a fault that the designer had anticipated but had let get by because of his greed in getting the contract.","popularity":0.0552,"poster_path":"/7Jw72ETworxxHctgKzOx8IvH9nR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jet Job","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Clements","original_name":"Stanley Clements","popularity":0.2183,"profile_path":"/gZTuaIB3WAFlgjeSG5CatqWNlWf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joe Kovak","credit_id":"62e93381091e62006048510c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":133788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Verdugo","original_name":"Elena Verdugo","popularity":0.2173,"profile_path":"/pzXmrzocmZqXAHitQhEO68rikLn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Elena Verdugo","credit_id":"62e933981ad93b0059a2b9b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Litel","original_name":"John Litel","popularity":0.7453,"profile_path":"/cH4K9uyqAjUWKZjBq0nA8VyOe14.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sam Bentley","credit_id":"62e933b06d9fe800597599de","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Beaudine","original_name":"William Beaudine","popularity":0.2333,"profile_path":"/3ZU7jfJuEBbJenUSXAX7DhqzTqA.jpg","credit_id":"62e93347764b99005ee35004","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":133434,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben Schwalb","original_name":"Ben Schwalb","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e93361357c00005dffcfec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0044767","wikidata_id":"Q16252025","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Jw72ETworxxHctgKzOx8IvH9nR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1952-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
