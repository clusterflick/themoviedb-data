Until he is visited by the Grim Ripper who hands him a letter with his name on it, a letter that means he will die just as the clock will strike midnight on new year's day, after which the Ripper leaves. Unfazed by the news, he continues his drink until he is greeted by a woman he has never seen before, who has also received a letter from the Ripper and overheard the conversion. During their final moments on earth before new year's day, they both bond, debate, and reflect on their lives.","popularity":0.314,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Death Delivered","title":"Last Year","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Death Delivered","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3125384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Oakley‎‎","original_name":"Will Oakley‎‎","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"John","credit_id":"62e89feef1b571005957295d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kitty Madden","original_name":"Kitty Madden","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jane","credit_id":"62e8a007f1b5710059572976","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3125386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Luke Brady","original_name":"Matthew Luke Brady","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/5fPruLit1tPU6JcTVwa9A65Q4pH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John the Bartender","credit_id":"62e8a0227caa47005b346220","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Nocton","original_name":"James Nocton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Reaper","credit_id":"62e8a03c6d9fe80059756853","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Wright","original_name":"Hannah Wright","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bar Extra#1","credit_id":"62e8a057fdf8b7005e73d891","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnathan Brocklebank","original_name":"Johnathan Brocklebank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bar Extra#2","credit_id":"62e8a069091e62005d2b57e1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646396,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jack Buyukyilmaz","original_name":"Jack Buyukyilmaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e8a0ea3081310058a824a7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tyler Leach","original_name":"Tyler Leach","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e8a08ae640d6005cc89a28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646394,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Rayner","original_name":"Alex Rayner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e8a0c1e640d6005cc89a3f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646395,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alex Rayner","original_name":"Alex Rayner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e8a0cdfdf8b7005e73d8b2","department":"Writing","job":"Writers' Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646393,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucy Laud","original_name":"Lucy Laud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e8a09b1e6489005ee3cb6a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":613,"name":"new year's eve"},{"id":6203,"name":"loss"},{"id":9957,"name":"loneliness"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Last Year - (Short Film)","key":"N4jG0HKNuMM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2022-07-20T14:45:01.000Z","id":"62e89fb61e6489005ee3cb1b"}]}}}
