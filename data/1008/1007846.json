All society needs reformation. She has her maiden aunt come to live with her as chaperon, and Minerva immediately starts in by reconstructing her. The trust company that has charge of her fortune is represented by young Mr. Grant, who looks on with dismay at the operations of Minerva and tries to dissuade her, but without success. She stops him from smoking and he compiles when she isn't looking. She discovers this and quarrels with him. A laborer making some repairs at the house attracts her attention when she finds him drinking a pail of beer with his lunch. She remonstrates with him and questions him about his home life. As a result she visits his mother's home and tries to educate the family, much against their will, lavishing money on them.","popularity":0.3166,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majestic Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minerva's Mission","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Gish","original_name":"Dorothy Gish","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/pawOaoP0uk1NZ5vDLizFohzx6Tn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Minerva","credit_id":"62e99d35f1b571005e2c1063","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1300231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cora Drew","original_name":"Cora Drew","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/WgbFxrhGJQd3bsliBYCUdbRw4B.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Minerva's Aunt","credit_id":"62e99d457caa470061e19049","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.E.
