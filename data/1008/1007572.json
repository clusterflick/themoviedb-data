So you would expect, under this formula, that the Palestinians would be very supportive of their fellow oppressed group, the LGBT community in the Middle East.  But is that really the case?  In PragerU’s new short documentary, Ami Horowitz goes right to the source. He interviews Palestinians to see what they think about gay people and then shows that footage to progressive Americans. The results may surprise you. They certainly surprised the Americans!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/o46IhElhwNfhcFk3EVK5DSsPqKX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Israelis or Palestinians: Who’s More Tolerant?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1053938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ami Horowitz","original_name":"Ami Horowitz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62e907076d9fe8005eed17a6","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2268,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/o46IhElhwNfhcFk3EVK5DSsPqKX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1514}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
