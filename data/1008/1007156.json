Perpetuating the critique of consumerism initiated with the deformation of bodies by the deformation of goods , the artist explores the excesses of a consumer society where we seek to consume more and more through the imagined life of our homes . It is also the subject of a video . The house is seen in the midst of an identity crisis ( Am I a house ? Or just a work of art ? And why am I fat ? ) . Using a fat house as both a sculpture and a video space to explore , he physically reclaims the identity of living space : houses feel and speak , they are also bodies and voices .","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fat House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3645232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erwin Wurm","original_name":"Erwin Wurm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e7cae31ad93b006153fcc6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
