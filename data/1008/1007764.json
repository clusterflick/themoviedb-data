Unknown to anyone but her brother Frank, Ruth is an expert at fixing auto and motorboat engines as the estate is on the bay and Ruth has the use of two launches. With Joe she goes for a boat ride but the engine breaks down and he is unable to fix it, and afraid that it would lower his opinion of her if she should repair the engine, she lets him call another boat to tow them back to the wharf. Merriam, while in love with Ruth, cannot bring himself to propose, fearing that she would be too ornamental for a farmer's wife, and half of his visit passes while he attempts to make up his mind.","popularity":0.251,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majestic Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Lesson in Mechanics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Gish","original_name":"Dorothy Gish","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/pawOaoP0uk1NZ5vDLizFohzx6Tn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ruth Wilson","credit_id":"62e9710d357c00005dffdeb5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Harron","original_name":"Robert Harron","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/8uqveFAwItcd5Ty2OEMPM37bbZb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joe Merriam","credit_id":"62e9711af1b5710059576b3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Crisp","original_name":"Donald Crisp","popularity":0.2368,"profile_path":"/MEPq09iLEwJVrxw1T97qOILhk6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62e9712425cd850060e6b28e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Bruce","original_name":"Kate Bruce","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/oLC99DsB0gkPdsZJRi0d1D1B4hD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62e9712fe61e6d0062f1e357","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christy Cabanne","original_name":"Christy Cabanne","popularity":0.2211,"profile_path":"/a7kRCLGEln54oL9ZqA7UblFAIDH.jpg","credit_id":"62e970ee764b99005ee35f2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11436,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anita Loos","original_name":"Anita Loos","popularity":0.1572,"profile_path":"/4APVlLs5pKLXsB5gliSf59kHVzF.jpg","credit_id":"62e970fa1ad93b006154a2d9","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0004217","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
