One day, Bob Jamison, really an American spy in the service, comes to the inn and stops overnight. He falls in love with the daughter of the innkeeper. She is infatuated with him, as he is the first human being who has ever been kind to her. He goes away but promises to return. While he is away a large reward is offered for his capture, dead or alive. The innkeeper tells the messenger of the news that if Bob ever comes back, he will put him into room seven and hold him. The daughter overhears this, and when Bob returns, unable to warn him, she changes the number on the door of room seven to that of six. When Bob is sent up to his room by Corto, he goes in what he thinks is seven but the daughter afterwards shifts the door numbers back to their original positions. Corto decides to kill Bob in his sleep and steals upstairs.","popularity":1.7618,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majestic Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tavern of Tragedy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Crisp","original_name":"Donald Crisp","popularity":0.2368,"profile_path":"/MEPq09iLEwJVrxw1T97qOILhk6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bob Jameson - the Spy","credit_id":"62e9436296522000581d1b22","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Gish","original_name":"Dorothy Gish","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/pawOaoP0uk1NZ5vDLizFohzx6Tn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dorothy Bell - the Innkeeper's Stepdaughter","credit_id":"62e94374764b99005ee3554c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"F.A.
