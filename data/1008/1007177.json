The Emperor of China rules over the Forbidden City of Peking. His unmarried daughter, the Princess Turandot, has refused her hand to all her princely suitors by putting them to a test. She sets them three riddles; if they do not answer them correctly, they will lose their heads. As unlucky suitors fail and fall, up steps Calaf, a prince of the Tatar people.  Daniel Kramer’s new staging in Geneva transposes the old fairy tale to a futuristic world where Turandot’s magic holds sway. In a dystopian game show, reminiscent of Hunger Games, the Princess presides over a surveillance state in which men are culled and the reproduction of the human race is conducted in breeding labs.","popularity":0.0659,"poster_path":"/bohrkxcgeBvaO1arUwDrNzjfnTO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turandot - Geneva","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingela Brimberg","original_name":"Ingela Brimberg","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Turandot","credit_id":"62e7d4361bf26600602dde99","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1573456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Merritt","original_name":"Chris Merritt","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":"/mvs4MG1AczCeHFJxFvabTPTXPKe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Altoum","credit_id":"62e7d43dfc5f06005e6fa290","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3481411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liang Li","original_name":"Liang Li","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Timur","credit_id":"62e7d4481e64890059c5b0a4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teodor Ilincai","original_name":"Teodor Ilincai","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/k4TdDW4kpQPRtWJuIOqn96LlK8p.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Calaf","credit_id":"62e7d44f1bf266005a611ece","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1707359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Dotto","original_name":"Francesca Dotto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Liù","credit_id":"62e7d456fc5f06005e6fa296","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone del Savio","original_name":"Simone del Savio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hwjmdm6aL4kgOrEge0Dj7xfOevr.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ping","credit_id":"62e7d45d357c00005dff5548","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2673607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Furness","original_name":"Sam Furness","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Pang","credit_id":"62e7d4671e64890059c5b0b2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3645291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Henric","original_name":"Julien Henric","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Pong","credit_id":"62e7d46e6d9fe80059751e88","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Mofidian","original_name":"Michael Mofidian","popularity":0.0436,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Un Mandarino","credit_id":"62e7d4767caa47005b3418d9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566630,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonino Fogliani","original_name":"Antonino Fogliani","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"66cf58fd7a438862f0722aa9","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3645293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kramer","original_name":"Daniel Kramer","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e7d4911e6489005ee37f8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1042,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bohrkxcgeBvaO1arUwDrNzjfnTO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":695}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RTS","release_date":"2022-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
