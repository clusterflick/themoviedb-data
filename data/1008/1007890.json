Meanwhile, newspaper editor Lonigan searches for reporter Slim Torrence, because Slim is friends with Tom Niles, the customs officer on the verge of cracking a whiskey smuggling case. Lonigan is about to send another reporter to cover the story when Della Parrish, the publisher's daughter, assures him that she can locate Slim. With the help of Slim's young photographer, Willie Sing, Della finds Slim in a waterfront dive, and Willie and Slim sneak aboard the Pacific Queen to find Niles. Niles hints that McCormick is the head of the smuggling ring and promises Slim an exclusive when he breaks the story the next day.","popularity":0.7891,"poster_path":"/7Vk6Tyth5e385lkqpJ5PG5tjaef.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1938-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Night Hawk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Livingston","original_name":"Robert Livingston","popularity":0.2222,"profile_path":"/9TDnvUPeWnBS7mPeGeIlHhTLLIe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Slim Torrence","credit_id":"62e9d71f965220006033861a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Travis","original_name":"June Travis","popularity":0.0842,"profile_path":"/yFkXL6tYjjUhKZrFD4HfjTw1Yld.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Della Parrish","credit_id":"62e9d72eaede590059ec044b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Armstrong","original_name":"Robert Armstrong","popularity":0.3239,"profile_path":"/5dZFHqLd8bJri8MpSSjpSOG1Dju.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Charlie McCormick","credit_id":"62e9d73d357c000060beace0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Welden","original_name":"Ben Welden","popularity":0.4643,"profile_path":"/cVN2BBCClcvSk7N9DsP8Z0wtNya.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Otto Miller","credit_id":"62e9d74c25cd8500580260b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Littlefield","original_name":"Lucien Littlefield","popularity":0.1619,"profile_path":"/65jnSJmU2BC4Jrpg2Nfg6glU6wN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Parrish","credit_id":"62e9d75a25cd850060e6d6fa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Downing","original_name":"Joe Downing","popularity":0.1763,"profile_path":"/zLWtkTj487PywkdNR5C4d8rulC0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lefty","credit_id":"62eaa41bfc5f060059c4bc08","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roland Got","original_name":"Roland Got","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/AoQpBLa4Ghfx4qRPGIEUBcGEfUt.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Willie Sing","credit_id":"62eaa42ff1b5710061356d0f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cy Kendall","original_name":"Cy Kendall","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":"/3UBuHub7H5iPv2W3BriYOBGGvAG.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Capt.
