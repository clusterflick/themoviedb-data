Many avant-gardists are trying to form their own approach to art. Alexander Rodchenko writes the \"Last Picture\" and puts an end to all fine art. Through design and photography, he becomes a \"singer of the new regime.\" This devotion leads him to the White Sea Channel. Rodchenko becomes a photographer of \"reforging\" people, turning a blind eye to the horror that is happening.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rodchenko","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3645885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Baturin","original_name":"Ivan Baturin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e833f81e64890061fcde3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
