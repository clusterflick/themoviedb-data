Dickinson is successful in this, and we see Jackson in his home just before leaving for the duel, admiring a miniature of his wife, which he afterwards places in his breast pocket. On the way to the dueling ground, Dickinson's skill with a pistol is shown by his breaking a glass, and also shooting a card from an innkeeper's hand.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Miniature","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Sorelle","original_name":"William Sorelle","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62e9491125cd850060e6a8dd","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1515938","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1910-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
