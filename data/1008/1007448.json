The South African production and distribution company African Films followed up the success of Zonk! with Song of Africa. This is a fantasy tale about a young Zulu who leaves his village to go to the city, falls in love with the new music he hears there, and returns home to form a Zulu jazz band â€“ which then goes to the city to compete with other bands, and comes out on top. As in the earlier films, the impact of American jazz and popular music is enormous.  Like African Jim and Zonk!, Song of Africa draws on the best talent from the townships. Director Emil Nofal and director of photography Dave Millin ensure high production values, making it an above-average B-movie.","popularity":0.0509,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":43845,"logo_path":null,"name":"African Film Productions Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1952-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Zulu","iso_639_1":"zu","name":"isiZulu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Song of Africa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3066406,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Brown","original_name":"John Brown","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64edb3a9e2bca80139ad248b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646354,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"David Millen","original_name":"David Millen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e890d27caa470061e1180e","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646352,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charles Berman","original_name":"Charles Berman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e89091f1b571005e2bb345","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646355,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jesmond Howey","original_name":"Jesmond Howey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e890fb357c00005dff97e0","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1162575,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emil Nofal","original_name":"Emil Nofal","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e890596d9fe80059756126","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646350,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank Secker","original_name":"Frank Secker","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e8907b1c09fb0058d04e54","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646356,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roscoe C.
