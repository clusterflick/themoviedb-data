She is such a devout pacifist that she spurns her lover when she learns that he has invented an aerial torpedo. Instead, she gets involved with a foreigner who swears that he totally shares her beliefs. Unfortunately, he is a foreign spy in disguise. At his urging, the innocent girl steals her ex-beau's plans and delivers them to the spy. When she learns that he is the enemy, she fights him and with a sword kills him. It is still not enough to stop the enemy from attacking an American port city.","popularity":0.2088,"poster_path":"/8ZoXZnE6Jf9Dnxg4T1Rgk5OZWAD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lubin Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nation's Peril","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1352936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ormi Hawley","original_name":"Ormi Hawley","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/bmb2jThurXgi4Rdy8hFoaSUOKM6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ruth Lyons","credit_id":"62e958ed8566d200627640e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1405084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William H.
