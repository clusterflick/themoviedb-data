Jackie, a young man who finds himself running the shelter after the sudden death of its legendary founder, discovers that the old house actually belongs to the municipality of Tel-Aviv, and has been bought by a businessman who's planning to demolish the house and build a boutique hotel on its ruins. Together with the house's at-risk youth, and with the help of a social worker who comes on board, Jackie launches a relentless struggle against the municipality's representatives, to save the house, which, for the youth it shelters-- is their last refuge, their last lifeline.","popularity":0.133,"poster_path":"/rOhl7ZDm8IxXikITQHM9yk9N7vp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2024-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children
