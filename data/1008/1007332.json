Examining the public’s preference for bland mass reproduction pictures which are traditional in style and ‘look nice’, the modern artist’s tendency to create an insular, inward-looking art for an educated elite and the media’s unwillingness to take modern art seriously, the film argues that the sense of alienation between artist and the public is largely the result of a class-divided society.","popularity":0.3027,"poster_path":"/lA8pDRzTZwHzytWwQisqMEmkQMB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art We Deserve?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2047776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Cork","original_name":"Richard Cork","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63037c185f4b730082686ae4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490740,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Bedford","original_name":"Richard Bedford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63037cdf96e30b0091204eed","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1557540,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chris Morphet","original_name":"Chris Morphet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63037cbb839d93007e4ce968","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Marre","original_name":"Jeremy Marre","popularity":0.064,"profile_path":"/x5EB9uwjUgpFElYGIWQRHNRwM1Q.jpg","credit_id":"63037c2cdfe31d0092050f88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Marre","original_name":"Jeremy Marre","popularity":0.064,"profile_path":"/x5EB9uwjUgpFElYGIWQRHNRwM1Q.jpg","credit_id":"63037cf567e0f7007a8bf16d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2221,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lA8pDRzTZwHzytWwQisqMEmkQMB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
