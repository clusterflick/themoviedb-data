In this film, food is the platter on which personal stories of ordinary people from all walks of life are collected, unravelled and served.  Just like an old friend who has shared or weathered significant moments with us, most of us connect to certain foods that comfort us and trigger nostalgic recollections of childhood and growing up.  By compiling these collective voices of Singaporeans, preserving their intimate takes of joys and woes, love and loss, Old Friends offers future generations a scrumptious taste of the past through our binding passion for food.","popularity":0.1539,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":161442,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chuan Pictures","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2015-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3645704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alvin Lee","original_name":"Alvin Lee","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e81a5d1c09fb006001432a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Royston Tan","original_name":"Royston Tan","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":"/8k4Z3KBcxrFqetVD5o2A5DTuLZn.jpg","credit_id":"62e81a68764b990061418aba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3645700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boi Kwong","original_name":"Boi Kwong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e81a407caa470061e0e3c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3645698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Debe Hoo","original_name":"Debe Hoo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e81a38f1b5710061348c48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10637,"name":"food"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Old Friends\" Trailer","key":"AogHmrUi0dE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-05-11T15:27:15.000Z","id":"62eeae27b2e074007afcdd3e"}]}}}
