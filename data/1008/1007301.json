He is honey- trapped by local thugs, and makes an escape. Running away from his pursuers, he ducks into a deserted shop in a mall. This turns out to be a place where men pay to talk to random lady callers on the phone. Tiger receives a phone call from a woman named Mani, who says she is blind. Mani tells Tiger of her first love and heartbreak from years ago. Eventually, Tiger reciprocates with his own story of loss and betrayal. After leaving the shop, under a bewitching sun, Tiger finds himself somehow transported to the streets of Taipei 30 years ago. He panics and bumps into a young woman on the street. She is blind and her name is Mani.","popularity":0.0843,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Hanging Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2351945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Shih","original_name":"Li Shih","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":"/2WycTGJ8wdrtgUSxF6Dyra96ZGv.jpg","credit_id":"62e814271bf26600602df40d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1450646,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julia Chu","original_name":"朱嘉懿","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e814371e6489005ee39310","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
