The minister-school-master persuades some of his parishioners to give the girl decent clothes, and he coaxes her into attending school. At first unruly and sullen, she gradually comes to feel that the minister is her best friend. One day she happens to see him meet a strange girl on the street. Apparently overjoyed, he kisses the stranger. Molly rushes into the house, tears off her new clothes, and vows she will never go to school again.","popularity":0.3675,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majestic Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Saving Grace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Burns","original_name":"Fred Burns","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":"/xzoiQBucdaeyP7YSQ9csyq43LBP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Shipton - the Minister","credit_id":"62e97a238566d2005a47c1a8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Gish","original_name":"Dorothy Gish","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/pawOaoP0uk1NZ5vDLizFohzx6Tn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mollie Kite - the Girl","credit_id":"62e97a436c8492005d13ec1d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Siegmann","original_name":"George Siegmann","popularity":0.1599,"profile_path":"/ekmTjMAXd71x4KSrFVfkc90vzDP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Old Kite - Mollie's Father","credit_id":"62e97a53e61e6d0062f1e5dd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Cummings","original_name":"Richard Cummings","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62e97a621ad93b0059a2cd65","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Burns","original_name":"Bob Burns","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/xqajGPjd1X6JpigS9tJaeNc59pr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62e97a6c1bf266005a61ae25","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennie Lee","original_name":"Jennie Lee","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/8034W64tp7po3W3wijIXoOp0Fxg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62e97a77f1b5710061350657","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1899476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dark Cloud","original_name":"Dark Cloud","popularity":0.1222,"profile_path":"/twdEtDEIAKpxcVHtEfWNIH9bZNa.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62e97a89fc5f06005e70348b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christy Cabanne","original_name":"Christy Cabanne","popularity":0.2211,"profile_path":"/a7kRCLGEln54oL9ZqA7UblFAIDH.jpg","credit_id":"62e979ed7caa47005b34a5b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11436,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anita Loos","original_name":"Anita Loos","popularity":0.1572,"profile_path":"/4APVlLs5pKLXsB5gliSf59kHVzF.jpg","credit_id":"62e979fcc68b69005d4c9dda","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0004561","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
