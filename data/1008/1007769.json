At her father's country place, Lee is unhappy because of her popularity but is appeased when she finally accepts his proposal and ring. Holden interrupts and claims a moment's talk. Telling Lee to wait for her in a favorite nook of the veranda, she goes with Holden while Lee strolls in the garden to await her. After proposing, Holden leaves her and hastens to the nook, seating himself with his back to the French windows. Lee is nearby in the garden finishing his smoke. He sees Holden in his chair, by the light of the latter's cigarette, and then sees Helen come from the lighted ballroom, approach the chair and throw her arms about Holden, sit in his lap and kiss him. Lee turns away in despair and anger and leaves the grounds.","popularity":0.2733,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majestic Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sands of Fate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Gish","original_name":"Dorothy Gish","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/pawOaoP0uk1NZ5vDLizFohzx6Tn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Helen Robinson","credit_id":"62e973461ad93b0059a2cbab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Harron","original_name":"Robert Harron","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/8uqveFAwItcd5Ty2OEMPM37bbZb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Arthur Lee","credit_id":"62e9735cf1b5710059576bf1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raoul Walsh","original_name":"Raoul Walsh","popularity":0.334,"profile_path":"/qwQVJ66JvChRPIFtLtSy8DkCnKW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"James Holden","credit_id":"62e9736e7caa47005e873008","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1300231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cora Drew","original_name":"Cora Drew","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/WgbFxrhGJQd3bsliBYCUdbRw4B.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Robinson","credit_id":"62e9737f9652200060336328","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3647397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Eberts","original_name":"Charles Eberts","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Mexican Guide","credit_id":"62e9738f25cd850058024074","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eagle Eye","original_name":"Eagle Eye","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62e9739c6d9fe8005eed39ae","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Crisp","original_name":"Donald Crisp","popularity":0.2368,"profile_path":"/MEPq09iLEwJVrxw1T97qOILhk6.jpg","credit_id":"62e97333aede5900617dfa6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0004559","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
