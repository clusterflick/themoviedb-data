One night, during a lunar eclipse, Pia is murdered. Her death plunges Gil into a world of shadows. He leaves the town by the river and does not return to the house he shared with Pia until two years later. There, Pia is present in the flood of memories that keep coming back to him, and also lives on deep in his heart. This love, the comfort it brings him, and the girl Elsa lead him out of the darkness and back into the light, back to life. And he will meet Pia's murderer. 'Eclipse' is a love story set against the background of a crime: compelling, poetic, and delicately told.","popularity":0.2024,"poster_path":"/A4j7iYTOXFCx680NKXmzk7S5pkg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eclipse","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matheus Nachtergaele","original_name":"Matheus Nachtergaele","popularity":0.3836,"profile_path":"/zgTT5AP7NYa2hN0jUqHIHkNyp2v.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e3f1f380c2710001a7d0ab2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Gofman","original_name":"Betty Gofman","popularity":0.1444,"profile_path":"/vVkDZNrsJuS8IT8xUiwO2dogCpo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e3f1f443dd126001652366b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulo Vespúcio","original_name":"Paulo Vespúcio","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/2sDKJmz3EDejxmgmZ0ViP84XppH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6727deca761979f005e2b9a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1135413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cida Moreira","original_name":"Cida Moreira","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":"/4mvkay9u1vQh96qtgImAakoZEsl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6727df64554083a56a0d73af","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1442790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romeu Evaristo","original_name":"Romeu Evaristo","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":"/e22OILnzupMNnNp90GRWWne3XeP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6727df72554578c90de2f443","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5039301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauriane Gomes","original_name":"Lauriane Gomes","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6727df7fde69a78ba9643926","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruy Polanah","original_name":"Ruy Polanah","popularity":0.1349,"profile_path":"/kTZMGkLRTS7Y1PqpIh7wU3yEu4Y.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6727df9f554083a56a0d73c9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1869556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrique Pires","original_name":"Henrique Pires","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6727dfab554083a56a0d73d0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":953333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caco Monteiro","original_name":"Caco Monteiro","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/kvrCvocopbSAPQf1DQGVGIzP2YY.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6727dfb8008c8137852de324","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Almeida","original_name":"David Almeida","popularity":0.0566,"profile_path":"/w2Kkd8ne7lYgfUabuXDABhKqxH6.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6727dfc9554578c90de2f455","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1484026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Brödl","original_name":"Herbert Brödl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3f1f1781c7be001730365a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1247851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Cecília Costa","original_name":"Ana Cecília Costa","popularity":0.1511,"profile_path":"/rIzbePMsnqgEv9c2gLUR1SDzi3m.jpg","credit_id":"6727ddb8555e3efc89c32bfc","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0336350","wikidata_id":"Q1281944","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A4j7iYTOXFCx680NKXmzk7S5pkg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
