While its initial sounds and images were filmed during the riots in Genoa, 2001, these materials are pulled apart and recomposed in order to locate the intensity of a shared experience, rather than producing one more documentary version of the programmed and hyper-mediatized confrontation of the G8 counter-summit. Elaborating a complex and rhythmic form of address via sound/image disjunctions, cheap video effects and performance, the film declares its own exile from a biopolitical space-time where nothing ever happens. The crisis it announces is the sudden return of history, but this time without characters or a story, and of a politics without subjects.","popularity":0.2264,"poster_path":"/nsmn74GccBuxpEx6yLWomgHalLq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135105,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Bernadette Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Get Rid of Yourself","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chloë Sevigny","original_name":"Chloë Sevigny","popularity":1.142,"profile_path":"/nC9jDliEnqbwSKhioUBd9gObDnr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59f293b0c3a3687217002cbf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3524660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner von Delmont","original_name":"Werner von Delmont","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"626852faeda4b7177d8be3dd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernadette Corporation","original_name":"Bernadette Corporation","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54921d9dc3a3683d0d000184","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.652,"height":767,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nsmn74GccBuxpEx6yLWomgHalLq.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5dNLGlaLOfDiD30zqmUV3RlVfCV.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
