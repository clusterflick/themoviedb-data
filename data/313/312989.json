It is only by the grace of isolated summer rains that the zebras can survive here at all. Family groups gather together to follow the rains, driven by a constant search for better grazing on islands of grass that dot the pans. Meerkat families watch the zebras come and go, and families of lions wait for them along their grueling trek, hoping for a chance to bring one down. Their journey is one that is sometimes limited by the fragility of new life, but always made possible by the strong family ties that help animals survive in one of Africa's most surreal landscapes. It's a tale of loyalty and sacrifice, of home and exile, of death and new life, in southern Africa's largest zebra population.","popularity":0.7853,"poster_path":"/iFJiYmRM1Ajphq2awH1nTzcu4Je.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134683,"logo_path":"/7i3upiV2YtUjCMqheIIhBaOwUbF.png","name":"Rubin Tarrant
