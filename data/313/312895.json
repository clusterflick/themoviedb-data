Great, except that he knows three Sandras: one he'd love to hear from, one he'd hate to hear from and a third he'd never expect to call him. Paul desperately wants to find out who is the woman who called and enlists the help of his close friend, who is a ladies man. Marc, though very busy himself and eager to pursue his business, agrees to help. And so begins an urgent investigation.
