Intricately woven, both stories run parallel in current time and through remembrances of the past, while taking place on separate sides of the country. The common link is Dr. O'Brien, Timmy's father as well as Smith's boss, and his noble research into a radical cure for cancer. While mainly comedic, the story is also told with dramatic and surreal moments.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deputy Bob","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0377763","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
