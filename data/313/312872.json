The camera approaches it from above, identifying only a few islands of light in a sea of darkness. Outside the film, it is - one can assume - part of a quarry: a conveyor belt on which earth and rocks are transported. There is a machine that runs the conveyor belt and a woman with tinted glasses who seems to be in control of the process. The film makes this handful of elements absolute: the conveyor belt, the machine, the woman and the dusty, deserted and unreal seeming horizon. The machine is not a functional tool in a process based on the division of labour, but the world’s motor. Without it, the conveyor belt, and thus the film’s conveyor belt, i.e. the entire world, would come to a standstill. The woman is, therefore, not a wage-earning employee, but the spirit of film and the world.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/yQ5aBxMY02agY7X20Qn8nAFms27.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orbitalna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcin Malaszczak","original_name":"Marcin Malaszczak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575d3966c3a368376900023d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcin Malaszczak","original_name":"Marcin Malaszczak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575d396e9251412b0c002aa1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3505450","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yQ5aBxMY02agY7X20Qn8nAFms27.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":710}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
