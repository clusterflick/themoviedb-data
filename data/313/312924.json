The journey takes him from Madrid to Galicia and on the search for these images he meets with various characters who will help him in his undertaking, such as the actors Paul Naschy and Javier Gurruchaga whose personal worlds will be examined in the film. Finally in Vigo, his home city, of which he presents a remarkable portrait, he finds an old film in Super-8mm with the missing images. The catharsis is produced with the viewing of the old film which turns out to be a tribute to cinema and this means the end of the filmmaker's introspective journey.","popularity":0.3212,"poster_path":"/uhWn3hSanPSyOiNzsJoBtsDVln4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42530,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cameo Films Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":44965,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlántico Films","origin_country":""},{"id":44966,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Indie Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2009-12-17","revenue":168658,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Images: The Other Eye of Juan Pinzás","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Las imágenes perdidas","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Las imágenes perdidas.
