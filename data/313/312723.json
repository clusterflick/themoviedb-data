Today, Montserrat’s 4,000 citizens are still coming to terms with this traumatic event. \"Montserrat: Emerald of the Caribbean\" explores how shared values—community, hope, faith—and traditions serve as sources of strength and identity for Montserratians as they rebuild their lives together. The film culminates in a portrayal of the sights and sounds of Montserrat’s annual St. Patrick’s Day Festival, a commemoration of African slaves who rebelled against their Irish slave masters on Saint Patrick’s Day, 1768. A unique blend of African, Caribbean, and Irish traditions, the Saint Patrick’s Day Festival represents the past, present, and future of a resilient people.","popularity":1.2088,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":208022,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of Pittsburgh","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"MS","name":"Montserrat"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Montserrat: Emerald of the Caribbean","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2570449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Willock","original_name":"Rose Willock","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e728883b1f68d0014ddd723","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2570452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Basil Chambers","original_name":"Basil Chambers","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e7289a1357c000019490f06","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2570456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Laughlin","original_name":"Susan Laughlin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e728a70e741460019678d19","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2570469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Sweeney","original_name":"Daniel Sweeney","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e728bb82f3b1700174a9cfe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2570474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Aymer","original_name":"Lloyd Aymer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e728cc2357c000016491c1e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1401006,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David William Seitz","original_name":"David William Seitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f99a60dc1cb401028c53e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1401006,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David William Seitz","original_name":"David William Seitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"549388d8c3a3686ae7000226","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1401007,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandra Klaren Seitz","original_name":"Alexandra Klaren Seitz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"549388ed9251416e1e00020d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1401008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erik Churchill","original_name":"Erik Churchill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54938904c3a3686af10002a0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1401009,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Burke Olsen","original_name":"Burke Olsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"549389109251416e1c00024d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1401006,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David William Seitz","original_name":"David William Seitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54938b26c3a3686ae300029b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2126883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Campbell","original_name":"Chris Campbell","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668dc9f3997dfdf78a0a2c98","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36377679","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5941,"name":"calypso"},{"id":167861,"name":"caribbean sea"},{"id":209352,"name":"st. patrick's day"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
