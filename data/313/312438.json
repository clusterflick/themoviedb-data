Most persistent among her suitors was Grigo, a coarse Sicilian, whose advances were odiously repulsive.

Romantic, poetic and a talented musician, Giuseppe was indeed a desirable husband for Minnie.","popularity":0.4257,"poster_path":"/n0cGjOsuGziBc9ROmQlfmk4w9VF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1909-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At the Altar","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Leonard","original_name":"Marion Leonard","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/ftSUgK4P92cPUOMGl3LLeFbdBan.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Minnie, the Daughter","credit_id":"5492b4739251410921001314","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Miles","original_name":"David Miles","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/7w36rEkldeOhe7QpQbd4hxPknqt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Father","credit_id":"5492b47ec3a3683cfa000f6c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Inslee","original_name":"Charles Inslee","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":"/adYzNqmBzmfGkFppoc8eHn2EHk5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Grigo, the Suitor","credit_id":"5492b489c3a3683d0d0014c0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry O'Moore","original_name":"Barry O'Moore","popularity":0.1153,"profile_path":"/6jZU8QqDfDnQOYxsWWM1zXWGv8i.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Giuseppe Cassella","credit_id":"5492b493925141090e001486","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1110484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Hendrie","original_name":"Anita Hendrie","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/9mUw7AhsLxTG667VTCOGnAPG8E3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"5492b49b92514118f2001322","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1129188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy West","original_name":"Dorothy West","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":"/h3m5mKBVYGRLpVvX0CE2vUTxs8D.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Minnie's Friend / Dinner Guest","credit_id":"5492b4a6c3a3683d00001335","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Arvidson","original_name":"Linda Arvidson","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/pxNBQP2W90PyV69sjH3CRvXL2O4.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5492b4afc3a3686068000885","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":128163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara T.
