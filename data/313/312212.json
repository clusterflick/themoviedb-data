William was born and raised in North Queensland, his grandparents having migrated from China to the Top End during the 1880s gold rush. Yet it was not until mid-life that he claimed his Chinese heritage, which had hitherto been lost to him by his complete assimilation into the Australian way of life. William's transatlantic exploration of his genealogy unites him with scores of relatives from all walks of life, some rich, but most ordinary folk with menial jobs, and most cannot speak a word of Chinese. A visual feast, Blood Links examines how the Chinese diaspora establish roots in foreign soil, and how over the generations, through intermarriage, blood is mixed; yet the intricate bonds of family remain.","popularity":0.2855,"poster_path":"/udIYgozbh9ECxCDfl0YWn6y7p5i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41577,"logo_path":"/6tkgqMVglDM5XFY1DWXVEQ4WZvV.png","name":"Felix Media","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"William Yang Blood Links","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1595375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Yang","original_name":"William Yang","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"680b28bde92f940ca69d3906","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Fox","original_name":"Martin Fox","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5491db3a9251414731002011","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4155764","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/udIYgozbh9ECxCDfl0YWn6y7p5i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":162710,"name":"culture"},{"id":200349,"name":"immigrant family"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
