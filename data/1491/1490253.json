This film looks at San Francisco-based Latvian artist and playwright Raimonds Staprāns’ nearly century-long experience of trying to define life and statehood. It constructs an exact replica of one of his paintings, and asks actors to portray characters from his plays. Keeping in mind the symbolically charged image of the red barn in the painting, it deliberately incites arguments between the actors, the director and the crew about the motivations of the characters as well as alternative actions or decisions that they could have taken but did not.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Red Barn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":984019,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pēteris Krilovs","original_name":"Pēteris Krilovs","popularity":0.3535,"profile_path":"/yf9PjgX3Sdo7KQZfUnYNi7KO6xj.jpg","credit_id":"683a36a394f9243dc8f2a8db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ieva Struka","original_name":"Ieva Struka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a36e93b60bce91d5376c6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":984019,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pēteris Krilovs","original_name":"Pēteris Krilovs","popularity":0.3535,"profile_path":"/yf9PjgX3Sdo7KQZfUnYNi7KO6xj.jpg","credit_id":"683a36fb2243f6b024fda7e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1308264,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Valdis Celmiņš","original_name":"Valdis Celmiņš","popularity":0.2231,"profile_path":"/bIUeLfSpth5h0uD4wTrqO4OisXo.jpg","credit_id":"683a370a54ec6aed01288265","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2880367,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Dāvis Līcītis","original_name":"Dāvis Līcītis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a37207956961424f2a9b6","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4016385,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mārtiņš Blanks","original_name":"Mārtiņš Blanks","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a37382ab005893aad7373","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2445164,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paula Popmane","original_name":"Paula Popmane","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a374a8ff65fc839f2a8ea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2879558,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arturs Maskats","original_name":"Arturs Maskats","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a375ce68027323b288310","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007606,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Uldis Cekulis","original_name":"Uldis Cekulis","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a3770fe9d47b512fda7d0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584917,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Agne Skane","original_name":"Agne Skane","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a37a2aeb8f490287b9e66","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
