Faccio, who conducted the first performance of Verdi's Aida in Italy and the world premiere of Otello, and Boito, Verdi's librettist of Otello and Falstaff, anticipated the musical language of later Italian verismo composers so their opera combines lovely musical interludes with superb vocal writing. Olivier Tambosi's \"excellent staging served it well, with a clear focus on the high points (The Telegraph)\". \"In the intermission and at the end there was vociferous enthusiasm of the audience for the late first encounter with this music\" (Neue Musikzertung).","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faccio: Hamlet","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavel Cernoch","original_name":"Pavel Cernoch","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kmMiSb2jQXlQjpDU1Rj7ll95n0q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Amleto","credit_id":"683bb725145a5f33b36896b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Sgura","original_name":"Claudio Sgura","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":"/wITyByBnywL3cRZBPwXgd51pszX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Claudio","credit_id":"683bb75cb30306f657f2af00","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2165479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduard Tsanga","original_name":"Eduard Tsanga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Polonio","credit_id":"683bb78bb21389eba37f3ac2","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21230084","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
