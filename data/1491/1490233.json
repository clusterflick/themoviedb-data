To capture a vivid, first-person account of the new realities of war in Iraq for FRONTLINE and ITVS, director Deborah Scranton (The War Tapes) created “a virtual embed” with the platoon, supplying cameras to the soldiers so they could record and tell the story of their war. The film intimately tracks the veteran soldiers of “Bad Voodoo” through the daily grind of their perilous mission, dodging deadly IEDs, grappling with the political complexities of dealing with Iraqi security forces, and battling their fatigue and their fears.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fsPho9ZVvOUC2XEtb4QMu3iYmcI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Voodoo's War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toby Nunn","original_name":"Toby Nunn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683a22557335d1f780ad734f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Paul Borda","original_name":"Jean-Paul Borda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683a2265e68027323b288245","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Hamlin","original_name":"Bryan Hamlin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683a22776d5809b1fb28824a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Nievera","original_name":"Ben Nievera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683a2280908fbddd5ed20b43","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Sidwa","original_name":"Jake Sidwa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683a2286f65a7ddf12288253","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Serbellon","original_name":"Jonathan Serbellon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683a2293e1842d6cf4fda7ca","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Thomson","original_name":"Richard Thomson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683a229eb7b45a021a6890a8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3648259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff","original_name":"Jeff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683a22aaf1dc67277bfda7a7","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Scranton","original_name":"Deborah Scranton","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a21f3b4893aa2b46890a2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Scranton","original_name":"Deborah Scranton","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a21ff7335d1f780ad7333","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Scranton","original_name":"Deborah Scranton","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a22127956961424f2a8b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1807679,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"P.H.
