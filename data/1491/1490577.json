It was recorded with the producer Nigel Godrich in the same sessions as Radiohead's previous album Kid A (2000). Radiohead split the work in two as they felt it was too dense for a double album. As with Kid A, Amnesiac incorporates influences from electronic music, 20th-century classical music, jazz and krautrock. The final track, \"Life in a Glasshouse\", is a collaboration with the jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton and his band.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kRkRMmrNgUgAk6K2V4596WfMzvv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radiohead: Amnesiac","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74332,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Colin Greenwood","original_name":"Colin Greenwood","popularity":0.8516,"profile_path":"/7k7cTHI3h23ky5RVspMsqevPuR1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"683b176cf3375a242e537a06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74333,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonny Greenwood","original_name":"Jonny Greenwood","popularity":1.0067,"profile_path":"/eUFJVx9TcEtmbdLOoFJUBjp5fUT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"683b1775e9b8d21fc26893e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thom Yorke","original_name":"Thom Yorke","popularity":1.1004,"profile_path":"/kVBSJNIMqQCMIkA84ENSz2YMhKj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"683b17951c9e61268c7f380b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74334,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ed O'Brien","original_name":"Ed O'Brien","popularity":0.7793,"profile_path":"/2xEJvTyAkUAa1b1k2k9J1CRg6bh.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"683b179ebf4a0f67e66894c0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74335,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philip Selway","original_name":"Philip Selway","popularity":0.8699,"profile_path":"/xin6x3Q86hV6Tp0Bt0wPA7GPS4N.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"683b1a4b682df7fa326894eb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":957038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel Godrich","original_name":"Nigel Godrich","popularity":0.6084,"profile_path":"/1vmCVU9C7rqTegIgNeI7ZwyAwGN.jpg","credit_id":"683b186c7db13287c0d20f38","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":957038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel Godrich","original_name":"Nigel Godrich","popularity":0.6084,"profile_path":"/1vmCVU9C7rqTegIgNeI7ZwyAwGN.jpg","credit_id":"683b20d6419947f017537c54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thom Yorke","original_name":"Thom Yorke","popularity":1.1004,"profile_path":"/kVBSJNIMqQCMIkA84ENSz2YMhKj.jpg","credit_id":"683b21731db03c402c7f38ba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w5P2XeSkaSKJH9RJxtxweiFDII0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kRkRMmrNgUgAk6K2V4596WfMzvv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
