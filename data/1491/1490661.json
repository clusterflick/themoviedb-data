After the war, inspired by the 1946 UN Declaration of Human Rights, he became a pioneering force behind LGBTQ+ rights in The Netherlands. Though known publicly as a successful TV actor, his hidden identity as Bob Angelo sparked lasting social change, helping shape the nation’s reputation for tolerance. With powerful music and a bold, unconventional approach, the film is a timely reminder of a legacy that still resonates—and one we may need now more than ever.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8plk1mVEAYW02P0oKbXLdk0CFcD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bob: Man of the Angels","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5475109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan de la Motte","original_name":"Dan de la Motte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"683b42e501b2931f3df2ac6a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5475110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monique Doppert","original_name":"Monique Doppert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"683b42eef0064156c2ad77cc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5475111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Szymon Adamczak","original_name":"Szymon Adamczak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"683b42f5f0064156c2ad77d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5475112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Glass","original_name":"Dan Glass","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"683b4304847d58f784fdacd7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5475113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bep Mous","original_name":"Bep Mous","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"683b430bf1dc67277bfdabdc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5475114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Hopelezz","original_name":"Jennifer Hopelezz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"683b43137335d1f780ad7750","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5475115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfred van Buuren","original_name":"Wilfred van Buuren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"683b4322f24d849af5ad7735","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5475116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filip Bloem","original_name":"Filip Bloem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"683b432aaaf0d71da6288714","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5475117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mattias Duyves","original_name":"Mattias Duyves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"683b43338d7bd34c48537a80","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4129963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Falconer","original_name":"Rob Falconer","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683b42c3b4893aa2b4689558","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4129963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Falconer","original_name":"Rob Falconer","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683b42c970bfd2cb33537acf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew J.
