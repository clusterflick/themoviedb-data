Here, pottery is more than just vessels, it’s stories molded in silence and heritage passed down through generations. ▪︎ We follow the potter through his day, hearing the soft whisper of wet clay, watching the fire breathe life into every form. ▪︎ We witness how each spin of the wheel carries a legacy, and how hands speak of home without uttering a word.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Documentary on Traditional Pottery Craft in Homs, Syria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
