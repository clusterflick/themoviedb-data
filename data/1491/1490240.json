The film recounts how the early mandate to create the conditions for a quick exit of the American military led to chaos, failure, and sectarian strife. In Endgame, producer Michael Kirk (Rumsfeld’s War, The Torture Question, The Dark Side, and The Lost Year in Iraq) traces why the president decided to risk what military planners once warned could be the worst way to fight in Iraq — door-to-door — and assesses the likelihood of its success. Top administration figures, military commanders, and journalists offer inside details about the new strategy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sQvqYfbXvZlMtELCpoWYG96bMUJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endgame","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4565115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Lyman","original_name":"Will Lyman","popularity":0.4076,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"683a26c989688b6603fda7b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732999,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jim Gilmore","original_name":"Jim Gilmore","popularity":0.2716,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self - Reporter","credit_id":"683a26d8f24d849af5ad7341","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Kirk","original_name":"Michael Kirk","popularity":1.1559,"profile_path":"/qlq7vZ1MwyyulWWBg0jGbI8bs6L.jpg","credit_id":"683a266fc2c43f93327b9e4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Kirk","original_name":"Michael Kirk","popularity":1.1559,"profile_path":"/qlq7vZ1MwyyulWWBg0jGbI8bs6L.jpg","credit_id":"683a267a89688b6603fda7b4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732999,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jim Gilmore","original_name":"Jim Gilmore","popularity":0.2716,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a26826f2cd45f867b9e50","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Kirk","original_name":"Michael Kirk","popularity":1.1559,"profile_path":"/qlq7vZ1MwyyulWWBg0jGbI8bs6L.jpg","credit_id":"683a26990dcb84ea5c7f3526","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451054,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Audette","original_name":"Steve Audette","popularity":0.3455,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a26b08f5e10eb267b9e72","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sQvqYfbXvZlMtELCpoWYG96bMUJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
