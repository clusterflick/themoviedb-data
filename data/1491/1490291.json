Murderer portrays the victims, who were murdered by fiercely anti-Semitic soldiers, and their anguished families, whose lives were torn apart by what happened to their loved ones. These families also demand justice, which was denied them when amnesty was granted to the military officers implicated in the torture and murders. In a striking and surprising scene, neighbors \"escrachan\" one of the repressors and try to expel him from the quiet neighborhood where he had retired to live. A stark examination of the wound in a country that has not yet healed.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lQt7XgZkP2D0dO9UT2FmTJq0jGn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123222,"logo_path":null,"name":"SET Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2002-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asesino","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nurit Kedar","original_name":"Nurit Kedar","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a5027ea742cf795ad73bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473668,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dror More","original_name":"Dror More","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a5059e6288940ae7f358a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nurit Kedar","original_name":"Nurit Kedar","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a5070a631056f23fda809","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473669,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Valle de Yardeni","original_name":"Valle de Yardeni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a5082053619a7adfda82b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2860064,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tali Halter Shenkar","original_name":"Tali Halter Shenkar","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a50fd95ed9d11777b9e96","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1940123,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Claude","original_name":"Alex Claude","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a511af24d849af5ad73cb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0478448","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lQt7XgZkP2D0dO9UT2FmTJq0jGn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":557}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jerusalem Film Festival","release_date":"2002-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
