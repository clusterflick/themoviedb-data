Now, with the rediscovered clips and Mitsuhiko’s own recollections, the film pieces together an intimate portrait of cinema’s “Emperor,” revealing how a young cinephile’s passion helped preserve invaluable fragments of film history. In the course of unearthing lost footage, Kawamura’s life takes an ironic course; he loved movies so much that his life became a movie.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/pNMJ0PO6seYyGw8vszSLj7RBXRY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A college student records behind-the-scenes of Akira Kurosawa’s Ran, only for the footage to be confiscated—until he reunites with it three decades later.","title":"Searching For Kurosawa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5474331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Rowland","original_name":"Richard Rowland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683ae4cbe47992c64afdaa5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5474332,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Erjol Muarem","original_name":"Erjol Muarem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683ae4e8f0064156c2ad75e6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5474335,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Herrington","original_name":"Michael Herrington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683ae5176d5809b1fb288551","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pNMJ0PO6seYyGw8vszSLj7RBXRY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":206619,"name":"kurosawa"},{"id":348492,"name":"film history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
