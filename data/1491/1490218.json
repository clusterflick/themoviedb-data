Dream Homes simultaneously challenges and reaffirms the country’s emphasis on freedom, individualism, and ingenuity.  Throughout its history, the US has given rise to intentional communities united by shared values, ideals, and domestic space. The film Dream Homes chronicles three contemporary LGBTQIA+ communal living structures across the nation, exploring daily life in these rural and suburban sanctuaries.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mAlZE4HPPlZxfECP9OZFtQjIg3F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream Homes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5473388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Bullock","original_name":"Michael Bullock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a18ba3c8027a3b7080cb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Cukr","original_name":"Michael Cukr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a1aa7c6a6b68ffd96912a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Cukr","original_name":"Michael Cukr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a2f5a2243f6b024fda7ce","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Cukr","original_name":"Michael Cukr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a2f68517cf91849d20b49","department":"Production","job":"Post Production Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473493,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Andy Medina","original_name":"Andy Medina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a2ff96a62f930a5288255","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5473495,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"KUKII","original_name":"KUKII","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683a301e14268f682028825e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mAlZE4HPPlZxfECP9OZFtQjIg3F.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vHRxMStE5bU1TvrIJ1uJSeAdnE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Cooper Hewitt","release_date":"2025-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
