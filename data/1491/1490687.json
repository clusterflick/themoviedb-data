The warehouse, no longer in use, had been cleared of its contents, revealing the original space. What might have transpired inside this aged warehouse over its long history? A temporary resting place, the warehouse briefly serves its purpose. A child playing the violin opens the door to the story. This piece is an homage to Heidi’s mother, whom Heidi lost at a young age, dedicating the \"shadowed time\" she carries to her mother, using the warehouse as a \"container for allegory.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HEIDI 46 — brick house","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5475210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"松井智惠","original_name":"松井智惠","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683b5009e78ffadf82537ad2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
