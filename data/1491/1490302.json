When Charlotte checks into BeingWell, a residential rehab facility, she expects to be alone, both physically and emotionally. Sheâ€™s surprised to find her assigned room already occupied by Dasha, a sharp-edged and volatile teen who instantly disrupts Charlotteâ€™s carefully guarded space. As the two women clash, their shared vulnerability slowly chips away at the walls between them. Through group sessions, private tension, and glimpses into their pasts, Charlotte begins to confront the patterns and relationships that brought her here, and considers, for the first time, what real healing might look like.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sRazEDxfgqrYh1PdDCqg5upOZss.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":263863,"logo_path":null,"name":"Logan G.
