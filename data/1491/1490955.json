Their struggle to become professional bodybuilders is endless and excruciating, the competition is intense. All the months of intense preparation lead to a few moments on stage in front of the judges where they show off the body they have been building for so long. Some call it an iron sport, a lifestyle, a vanity, while to others bodybuilding is a religion. All agree, though, that once a bodybuilder, always a bodybuilder.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Made in Vain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18547930","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
