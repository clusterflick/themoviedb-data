Mario was a little nervous in the summer of 2024. He was falling in love with Sara, a girl he met on twitter around that time, and he's an overthinker... Everytime he started overthinking stuff, he went outside to find some calm and solace in nature. For years, Mario and Víctor have been talking about their concerns with the limitations and contradictions in the relationship between representation and identity. But lately, this conversation has tilted especially towards the problematics in the representation of landscapes and nature. They always try looking beyond the western capitalist framework to find new possibilities, forever in search of that formless great image. However, Mario's too in love to concentrate on these topics like he usually does... all he can think of is how much he wishes Sara was there with him: to look at that sunset together, to be together (in) that same space and time.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Galician","iso_639_1":"gl","name":"Galego"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"the great image has no form - notes on the creation of identifying symbols","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5472359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Bodas","original_name":"Mario Bodas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mario","credit_id":"6839ad62d2e35e538999ae4b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4574349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Álvarez","original_name":"Sara Álvarez","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sara","credit_id":"6839ad718d6ddb0fd82b610e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2277057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Víctor Soho","original_name":"Víctor Soho","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nFQ7incqv91GckmYZei708Tvaix.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (Víctor)","credit_id":"6839ad87890f397d1b3d215c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2277057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Víctor Soho","original_name":"Víctor Soho","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nFQ7incqv91GckmYZei708Tvaix.jpg","credit_id":"6839ad96e5e71af76e080a31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2277057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Víctor Soho","original_name":"Víctor Soho","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nFQ7incqv91GckmYZei708Tvaix.jpg","credit_id":"6839ada2be381348bf968f3e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2277057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Víctor Soho","original_name":"Víctor Soho","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nFQ7incqv91GckmYZei708Tvaix.jpg","credit_id":"6839adb3114b71e627edca08","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2277057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Víctor Soho","original_name":"Víctor Soho","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nFQ7incqv91GckmYZei708Tvaix.jpg","credit_id":"6839adc60b17b6a691cda159","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2277057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Víctor Soho","original_name":"Víctor Soho","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nFQ7incqv91GckmYZei708Tvaix.jpg","credit_id":"6839ade2c7b98fbab65599b3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"gl","note":"Winner of the María Luz Morales Prize for Best Videoessay about the AudioVisual medium (International) given by the Galician Academy for the AudioVisual Medium ","release_date":"2024-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
