Her death — filmed on a cameraphone, then uploaded to the web — quickly became an international outrage, and Agha Soltan became the face of a powerful movement that threatened the hard-line government’s hold on power. With the help of a unique network of correspondents in and out of the country, FRONTLINE investigates the life and death of the woman whose image remains a potent symbol for those who want to keep the reform movement alive.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/j1mKwrlz6X5JtT1ool9RN6WwBRs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Death in Tehran","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5475071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neda Agha-Soltan","original_name":"Neda Agha-Soltan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683b3cb4419947f017537ce4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5475072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Faranak Amidi","original_name":"Faranak Amidi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683b3cc5c2c43f93327ba2d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5475074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arash Hejazi","original_name":"Arash Hejazi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683b3cd714531dc838288694","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serena Fang","original_name":"Serena Fang","popularity":0.2254,"profile_path":"/js2PgRyrgUDDkFoYsfEFi37JsoL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683b3ceac8fa40b281f2abfa","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1359851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monica Garnsey","original_name":"Monica Garnsey","popularity":0.1857,"profile_path":"/rZEfLBS0JyUvBkKq24VUbZRQY11.jpg","credit_id":"683b3d07f0064156c2ad77b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1359851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monica Garnsey","original_name":"Monica Garnsey","popularity":0.1857,"profile_path":"/rZEfLBS0JyUvBkKq24VUbZRQY11.jpg","credit_id":"683b3d52b21389eba37f38ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1535719","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2700,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j1mKwrlz6X5JtT1ool9RN6WwBRs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
