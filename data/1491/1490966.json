Two years ago, Ah-man (Ng Wing-sze), an independent yet stubborn university student, left home after a furious argument with her mum when the Umbrella Movement broke out. Now, she undertakes a new kind of lifestyle – a life of a vegetarian and an organic farmer. However, she never stops thinking of the taste from home. With the film's fragmentary narrative style, Ah-man’s story also reflects the ambivalent decisions between family and society of her friends. After her stunning performance in Conditioned (the Fresh Wave Award-winner of last edition), Ng Wing-sze goes on exploring her acting possibilities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"離家不遠","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
