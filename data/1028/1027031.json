The film was developed over four years of collaboration between filmmakers and 11 Inuit communities across Labrador. It cinematically explores an array of lived experiences, from youth to Elders and hunters to cooks, to ensure that the stories of those living on the frontlines of this ecological crisis are HERD. It is a portrait of the deep connections that exist between humans and non-humans, a glimpse of heartbreaking loss felt by entire communities, and a lasting testament of cultural resilience in the context of ecological uncertainty.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tgluP1fatYl7RLhFjLnX5QPsKx7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story of Inuit and caribou in Labrador","title":"Herd: Inuit Voices on Caribou","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3706354,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Borish","original_name":"David Borish","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gc61pyYUhr3at7rsnZqhA1p3Zyt.jpg","credit_id":"632b81fc6ca9a0007a049172","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3706354,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Borish","original_name":"David Borish","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gc61pyYUhr3at7rsnZqhA1p3Zyt.jpg","credit_id":"632b8210cf9ba3007aa4039f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3706354,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Borish","original_name":"David Borish","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gc61pyYUhr3at7rsnZqhA1p3Zyt.jpg","credit_id":"632b8224a3b5e60091f6157f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3706358,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Inez Shiwak","original_name":"Inez Shiwak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b82702dffd80091fd44a7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3710469,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Taiowa Butenschoen","original_name":"Taiowa Butenschoen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b82882dffd80091fd44b4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3706354,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Borish","original_name":"David Borish","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gc61pyYUhr3at7rsnZqhA1p3Zyt.jpg","credit_id":"632b829350733c007abd39bb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3706354,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Borish","original_name":"David Borish","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gc61pyYUhr3at7rsnZqhA1p3Zyt.jpg","credit_id":"632b82a86ca9a0007d7f875d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3710470,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Eldred Allen","original_name":"Eldred Allen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b82c1c8f3c40083ea6ae7","department":"Crew","job":"Drone Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3710471,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Artsiom Zartaiski","original_name":"Artsiom Zartaiski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b82fb61bac4007bf56605","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3710472,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Katie Winters","original_name":"Katie Winters","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b834dc8f3c40083ea6b0b","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3710474,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Garth Laidlaw","original_name":"Garth Laidlaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b8372fdc1460092836981","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3706356,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ashlee Cunsolo","original_name":"Ashlee Cunsolo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b8399ba4802007c754552","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3710475,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sherilee L.
