Featuring Peter Sarstedt's Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)? - a number one in 1969 and a hit he never really matched, Trio's 1982 smash Da Da Da, Phyllis Nelson's 1985 lovers rock-style classic Move Closer, and The New Radicals' 1999 hit You Get What You Give.  We travel through the years selecting some of your favourite number ones and a few others that came close, revealing what's happened to the one-off hitmakers since and exploring the unwritten laws that help make sense of the one-hit wonder phenomenon.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/cVFTY57qS4mdz52vUyncO5RknsO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One-Hit Wonders At The BBC","video":true,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"One-Hit Wonders at the BBC: Volume One","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7nMsBAOezsYtNeVcHrvCTCMKrF4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1471,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cVFTY57qS4mdz52vUyncO5RknsO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Four","release_date":"2015-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
