Suddenly sharing a full-sized bed, the sisters struggle to make peace with their newfound living quarters. But, while editing April’s college essays, Wendy discovers her purpose–to help April find hers. Over fourteen days, the girls grow from acquaintances to artistic allies as they realize their unstoppable potential to pursue their passion.  Based on a true story, this film was shot in Houston with an entirely Texan cast & crew. Creator Abby Tozer donated $2500 to the Cynthia Woods Mitchell young performing artists' scholarship.","popularity":0.2213,"poster_path":"/hPZNnvgdhwEYAjgbEeGdGEMKoEe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Positive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3710439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abby Tozer","original_name":"Abby Tozer","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Wendy","credit_id":"632b75c0cf9ba3007d803410","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3710440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Savannah Bryan","original_name":"Savannah Bryan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"April","credit_id":"632b75ce4b6d9d007e58ecc7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2952053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connor Angus","original_name":"Connor Angus","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b75f9ef9d72007b1d80f3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3710439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abby Tozer","original_name":"Abby Tozer","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b76a6ef9d72007e34a621","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3710439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abby Tozer","original_name":"Abby Tozer","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b76b34b6d9d0083f95657","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1719931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate R.
