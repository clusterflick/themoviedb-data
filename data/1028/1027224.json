The story unfolds through the words and skills of the older Piaute women of southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada. They tell us how they make cakes from berries, baskets from tulles, cord for netsâ€¦necessary daily tasks linked with an ancient heritage. The earth is ever present in the film, wildlife, rivers and marshes, sagebrush desert, all part of the story. The lifeways of the Northern Paiutes are followed through a seasonal cycle, from root-gathering in spring to building shelter in winter.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/pxqxXLauk3ANMewuEuO3OLlsL4C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Earth is Our Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3711066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Patapoff","original_name":"Elizabeth Patapoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632c4590a3b5e60091f66d97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pxqxXLauk3ANMewuEuO3OLlsL4C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
