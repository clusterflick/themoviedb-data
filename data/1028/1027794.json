To gain recognition, the bumbling trio decide their next endeavor will be a short film about a jewelry store robbery. Meanwhile, two grifters, Larry and Terry, are tired of being small time criminals, so they plot to rob the local marijuana dispensary.

true.","popularity":0.0892,"poster_path":"/1vlBRgip8gltrz5h5QQMTKNuaAP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182922,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reading Film
