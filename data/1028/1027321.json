From the historically important to the utterly (and sublimely) absurd, they feature a cast of characters ranging from legendary avant-garde filmmakers, scholars, and other cultural figures to civilians whose legend has (until now) been confined to the offices of Anthology, thanks precisely to their witty, eloquent, eccentric – or in some cases unforgettably psychotic – voicemails. We’ve toyed with the idea of sharing these messages in some form for years, and the “Imageless Films” series provides a perfect pretext.","popularity":0.2085,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Please Leave a Message: Anthology Film Archives Voicemails Through the Ages","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"632c914315794a007e0de53e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abel Ferrara","original_name":"Abel Ferrara","popularity":0.3652,"profile_path":"/ymyeTdUit4Atectxxvrxla3M7nq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"632c914bdd47160084429f00","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"632c9155fcec2e007cb5de2d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Gibbons","original_name":"Joe Gibbons","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"632c915ee3fa2f007fd4f827","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Jacobs","original_name":"Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/lLWmlUKswUHhW6TEHD4i56xleke.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"632c916355937b008e53c536","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Baillie","original_name":"Bruce Baillie","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/gV1ezFXy2xzLJXvqug8rafWtJPC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"632c916afcec2e00810719e7","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
