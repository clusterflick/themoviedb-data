To do this, Gustav must re-enact memories from his life, that each elicit one of six pure human emotions: pleasantness, unpleasantness, arousal, subduing, stress and relaxation. Only after performing these memories to a mysterious god, known as the Monad, will he find out if he's reached his goal. But first he must practise; Alma hires an acting coach to help him do just that.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/4sMvYJ35jX5Rs3eOEQk7FzPxnLG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Application Process","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Garrett","original_name":"Pat Garrett","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Alma","credit_id":"632defb14c1bb0007ab22d49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Garrett","original_name":"Pat Garrett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Coach","credit_id":"632defe004733f00909518a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1138283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Persiva","original_name":"David Persiva","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Asbestos Man","credit_id":"632df0de55937b007c091fc2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1878660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Worthman","original_name":"Michael Worthman","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":"/dGDn6g0Smtd2Ziz1PEuNnPRb8Mu.jpg","credit_id":"632df06631644b007ee8a879","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Wake-Walker","original_name":"Jack Wake-Walker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632df01dabdafc007cd90729","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3129640,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Helena Barrero","original_name":"Helena Barrero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632df0380443c90084ab2657","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Wake-Walker","original_name":"Jack Wake-Walker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632deffafcec2e007cb648e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Wake-Walker","original_name":"Jack Wake-Walker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632df046e10f46007d26524b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Wake-Walker","original_name":"Jack Wake-Walker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632df0500443c9007ccca218","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4sMvYJ35jX5Rs3eOEQk7FzPxnLG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
