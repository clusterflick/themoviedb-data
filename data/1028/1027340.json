On this DVD you can experience Mile's cool sound playing with John Coltrane and the Gil Evans Orchestra in 1959, as well as a few tunes from 1967 with his stellar group featuring Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams. Although highly experimental, the group's music was still strictly jazz and was to be Miles Davis' last acoustic quintet.","popularity":0.055,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miles Davis, So What","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11357142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
