Kai is able to win with one hundred and one.  However, the challenge alerts Wu who scolds Kai and Jay for removing bricks from the monastery walls instead of meditating on the six Fundamental Virtues of Spinjitzu. Kai claims he would never forget the virtues, but when asked to recall, he's unable to come up with an answer. Wu asks the rest of the ninja what the six virtues are including Nya and Zane, but nobody could remember.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2n07V1bQsNzS5GQ0cwY6zPqfFkW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Curiosity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1504,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2n07V1bQsNzS5GQ0cwY6zPqfFkW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
