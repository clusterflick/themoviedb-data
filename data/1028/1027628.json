On August 19th 1966,  the peaceful silence of ancient lands was broken for 30 seconds. Those 30 seconds changed the destiny of many people for decades. Townsfolk run screaming from the earthquake, which is a mystery for them. People repeat the word “Kaf” to one another as they run away. Screams join the rumble of the roaring land. Houses are ruined, bodies are buried in the ground, snakes invade, bees attack, there is water shortage and great pain. Varto is in ruins. A new day comes, a month, a year and the story of a tragic journey continues for the people who survived. Survivors migrate to all corners of the country and the world. Varto was unknown in the world media until this terrifying incident. This film aims to witness the fate of a land and journey of the people who experienced the 1966 Varto earthquake, carrying its tragic marks for life.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/4evBzS1lSyh3C4N15We5Ce0UhkA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KAF KAF","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Metin Dağ","original_name":"Metin Dağ","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632dd16c2a210c007fd0d0bb","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3268174,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erhan Örs","original_name":"Erhan Örs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632dd1480443c9008124aa66","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043355,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yıldıray Gürgen","original_name":"Yıldıray Gürgen","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/zjbSpfhwde8QZ0MO4R2THcjGawi.jpg","credit_id":"632dd17d31644b007ee8a080","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Metin Dağ","original_name":"Metin Dağ","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632dd13bdd4716007cf8ae91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Metin Dağ","original_name":"Metin Dağ","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632dd15f7719d7007ac3f850","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6YFeYWemZeo35RKFbN3U8jtCrBN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1422}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4evBzS1lSyh3C4N15We5Ce0UhkA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1142}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antalya Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
