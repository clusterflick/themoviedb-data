Director Villi Hermann followed him in this endeavor for several years, immersing us in the photographer's eye and capturing the essence of his work on these forgotten souls. Seibert, with his lens, and Hermann, with his camera, weave together a poignant narrative that sheds light on the often-hidden reality of China's economic growth. \"From Somewhere to Nowhere\" is an ode to humanity in an ever-changing world, a reflection on the individual's place in the grand scheme of things, and a celebration of the power of photography as a means to capture the spirit of an era.","popularity":0.1225,"poster_path":"/l5IByQlZ0Az9uTscjc8SyhYYhYl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182803,"logo_path":"/vOXOypzsavvidjWqcMBt7MG1V5Z.png","name":"Imagofilm
