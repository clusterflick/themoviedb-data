It is inspired by Kaunas' modernist architecture and seeks to uncover the city's magical hidden history. “Barry has approached the task of making a film about a place by democratising the action of filmmaking through collaboration with its people. Klostės is infused with a sense of ownership of their histories, legacies and identities. It is also a wholly original work from one of Ireland’s greatest artists.” — William Fitzgerald, director of The Galway Film Fleadh","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/dcoaRORyDnJKKaRokiK3SGPsyAU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2022-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Watch the hidden history of Kaunas unfold","title":"Folds","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilija Filipenkovaitė","original_name":"Emilija Filipenkovaitė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Veronika Sleivyte","credit_id":"67194fbb5be9e8759da6c25a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2622674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tekle Baroti","original_name":"Tekle Baroti","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/iixvaER6CPHFVHcGtqeAntRTb4y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"67194fcb5be9e8759da6c267","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4353403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aideen Barry","original_name":"Aideen Barry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6543be516beaea00eaf64ce9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017859,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sandra Bernotaitė","original_name":"Sandra Bernotaitė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67194fe55be9e8759da6c292","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017860,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arūnas Periokas","original_name":"Arūnas Periokas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67194ff95be9e8759da6c2ae","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017862,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ieva Raubytė","original_name":"Ieva Raubytė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671950089ff681d9e0a3a920","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017863,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patris Židelevičius","original_name":"Patris Židelevičius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6719501b27bd57d91f6234b3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4745657,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Aleks Rydzkowska","original_name":"Aleks Rydzkowska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6719502327bd57d91f6234be","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3947046,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Simonas Korsakas","original_name":"Simonas Korsakas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671950579ff681d9e0a3a95f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3947045,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Aleksandras Polevojus","original_name":"Aleksandras Polevojus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671950676e4210780f78a3e1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4175536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikas Zabulionis","original_name":"Mikas Zabulionis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6719507c2685cb6563c08b5f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21104106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cnAFkyzpCLa53gcAlghgQWjTtJw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"lt","file_path":"/ezYCQO0aM2EHv4fqyLlerfOE57U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":701},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dcoaRORyDnJKKaRokiK3SGPsyAU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
