This cabinet is the only location in the film. It seems that they are in the cabinet, like they are closed, separated from others, even from the other journalists. It’s a slow and minimalistic film. It’s not a film about one specific journalistic research; this film presents a monotonous and nervous atmosphere in this cabinet. The boundaries between truth and falsehood begin to overlap, journalists experience the betrayal of a colleague, the office becomes sweltering and unpleasant.","popularity":0.1262,"poster_path":"/9kmkTVDKeQwLw6zBdP0iH3O7LrP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film
