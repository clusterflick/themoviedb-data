This ambitious construction site will serve as background to our cinematic journey; weâ€™ll observe sorrowful mourners, Palestinian builders, and Ultra-Orthodox morticians roaming around the spectacular monument. The lively collage they create together shows the eternal struggle of Jerusalem between the high and the low, progress and tradition, manual labour, and sacred work. This is a film about a city of contrasts, about death and the life surrounding it.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Necropolis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2764879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keren Alexander","original_name":"Keren Alexander","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6174be3ee72fe8002b51b3ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
