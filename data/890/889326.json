The film focuses on the power of listening as a social, spiritual and artistic act – an antidote to the current pandemic of loneliness. The Centre’s visitors, who want to feel seen, welcome the camera as a way to reinforce the acceptance they seek. The listening sessions reveal a shocking and yet relatable social picture, made of voices that are not easily accessed, and that would otherwise remain unheard.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Listening Centre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3282851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlotta Berti","original_name":"Carlotta Berti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61757baafd7aa4006616dedd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
