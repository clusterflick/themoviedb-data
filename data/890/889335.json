This central narrative is articulated through those of a Mexican activist lawyer, a Greek professional couple, a Tunisian journalist and a Kurdish student. Each has some connection to international networks of solidarity and activism, which, for some, are now in the past. Filmed in New York, Marseille, and Athens, their separate recollections converge in a portrait of the tensions between the personal and the political today.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Anarchist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1840282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Cartelli","original_name":"Philip Cartelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b8132819690c0092f0110d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1840270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariangela Ciccarello","original_name":"Mariangela Ciccarello","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/dvhgRRBUeyiezQhPNWjUspE3ZuU.jpg","credit_id":"61757f29df86a800667ad0d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
