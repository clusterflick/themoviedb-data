Its economy is almost entirely dependent on the presence of U.S. military bases and Japanese tourism. Although Guam is located over 6,000 miles away from the U.S. mainland, its American-style malls and road signs are indistinguishable from the United States. The film, similar to Beau Travail, will bear witness to the activities of soldiers in a colonized land, while also giving voice to the natives.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sea, the Island and the People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2974029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chivas DeVinck","original_name":"Chivas DeVinck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61757e4e894ed60064722b6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
