Opting for breadth over depth, this officially authorized documentary covers all 36 races in the Winston Cup season, from Rockingham, North Carolina, to Homestead, Florida. While each race is allotted only a few breathtaking minutes apiece, the race summaries are quite thorough and the images... well, you'd have to actually drive the cars to get any closer to the action. There's racing drama everywhere, as seasoned pros like Sterling Marlin face off with younger upstarts like Jimmie Johnson and Tony Stewart--the latter being the season's ultimate champion. Multi-car pile-ups add to the thrill, along with abundant interviews, pit-lane excitement, in-cockpit cameras for virtually every driver, and crash footage that will have you reaching for a sofa seatbelt.","popularity":0.067,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winston Cup 2002","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
