Through young Eliana, the director's alter ego, we follow the story of burnout, work retraining and healing of a human soul using radical forms of therapeutic strategies. Everyday life blends into the reality of dream spaces – “emotional incubators”, where the individual becomes collective. And the film becomes a part of the personal journey of the author as well as a hero of the story. We are situated in Berlin, representing the generic and business area of metropolitan cities in Europe.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Not Your Fault","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3282852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula Ďurinová","original_name":"Paula Ďurinová","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61757c10f8595800434c0c7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
