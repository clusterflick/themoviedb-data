A victim of rising rents and rapid gentrification, this family owned business was a staple of the working class community that once could afford to live in the area. Chronicling the final days of this beloved bakery, The Last Bread (2013) captures the death of yet another small business in an increasingly homogeneous New York City. La Villita was located on the corner of Grand street and Bedford Ave, the division between the North and the Southside of Williamsburg.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/fnvSwkAP2bxFEMZ5ywfBra0Lk1y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100319,"logo_path":null,"name":"UnionDocs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Bread","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3284451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Rosa Badia","original_name":"Maria Rosa Badia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617712ce924ce5008e82f462","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3286920,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Federica Sasso","original_name":"Federica Sasso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61799e885294e70044fbb184","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3284451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Rosa Badia","original_name":"Maria Rosa Badia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61799e97678259008fd4e870","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3286928,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christopher Allen","original_name":"Christopher Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61799f7ea097dc0065f76ce6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3284451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Rosa Badia","original_name":"Maria Rosa Badia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61799f930d5d850091697f9d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5618724","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1916,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fnvSwkAP2bxFEMZ5ywfBra0Lk1y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Criterion Channel","release_date":"2021-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
