Ana’s mother is out in the street and, for no apparent reason, has started to dance. Ana feels deeply humiliated by her mother’s unexplainable behavior. To make matters worse, her mother keeps dancing without stopping for several days, and eventually other people start joining her without giving any explanation. Mortifed by embarrassment, Ana and other teenagers in the village try everything to distance themselves from the adult dancers; but the grown-ups seem determined to make fools of themselves, and to carry everything along with them while landscape, plants, animals, and social roles seem to turn ridiculous as well.","popularity":0.0889,"poster_path":"/zOlXCvxsDF0ctgsTaV9sOhV1NJd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178406,"logo_path":"/q3Y5qKckDiF65bKf74gJCIvo2WM.png","name":"Cárcava Cine","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":211038,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amondo Cine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margarethe Doesn’t Want to be Seen Dancing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1959353,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fernanda de la Peza","original_name":"Fernanda de la Peza","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/q0x9AEv7ZmX2nHTbgnvVDFM9kFt.jpg","credit_id":"652cafbc72c13e00c630fe48","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3217559,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Itzel Sierra","original_name":"Itzel Sierra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652cafca6611b40139b413a4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joaquín del Paso","original_name":"Joaquín del Paso","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/esiZMKkTaZGEMFmDX3N0b59FgR4.jpg","credit_id":"652cafa3ea84c700aef352bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1843961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Herrera Torres","original_name":"Gabriel Herrera Torres","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/crfK7jaLTxqSocPnFeG8PXIXUDF.jpg","credit_id":"6176fdfc924ce5002d2f6928","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4NJHMglTt0uQVZrR7H4zSczONM9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zOlXCvxsDF0ctgsTaV9sOhV1NJd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
