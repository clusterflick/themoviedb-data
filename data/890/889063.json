Through the renowned ornithologist Luboš Peške, we observe the changes in these links that affect the life and death of birds - on the level of individuals, populations, and species. Tension emerges between human capability to have a relationship only with one particular individual and the fact that for survival of the species, the individual means nothing.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who is Missing Today?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3282070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Květa Přibylová","original_name":"Květa Přibylová","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6174bb08cf4b8b00428d0a69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
