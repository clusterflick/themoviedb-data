Full of life, they take part in demonstrations and party meetings and believe that they can change the current world, dominated by ruthless capitalism and pressure for performance, for the better. At least until the moment when it turns out that it is almost impossible to change the minds of the older party members and the unsuccessful attempts to win new supporters intersect with the difficulties in their personal lives. Comrades is an empathetic time-lapse portrait that shows how the current young generation is losing its illusions, and how difficult it is to keep faith in what we believe makes sense.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/nHexdTpaWAECf67VzCgFdFF7Y1b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111896,"logo_path":"/y6yKNYlGCucATEjqMBe8YRTs8hv.png","name":"Kijora Film","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2024-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comrades","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanna Janikowska","original_name":"Joanna Janikowska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61758a9e176a940042be5759","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2201939,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Gawlita","original_name":"Anna Gawlita","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672212f328bd966c9e66f37a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2180797,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michał Poddębniak","original_name":"Michał Poddębniak","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672213181df70f7920fec99c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edoardo Morabito","original_name":"Edoardo Morabito","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67221332991edb035c5f6908","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5031183,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pola Krzesiak","original_name":"Pola Krzesiak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67221358180b0a5ab90c1f06","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333332,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adriano Mántova","original_name":"Adriano Mántova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672213c21df70f7920fec9d1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanna Janikowska","original_name":"Joanna Janikowska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672213e9180b0a5ab90c1f31","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5031188,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karolina Błażejczak","original_name":"Karolina Błażejczak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6722140eeeb0c5ef3b9baa52","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977866,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Giovanni Labadessa","original_name":"Giovanni Labadessa","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6722142528bd966c9e66f386","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4469716,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Enrico Zavatta","original_name":"Enrico Zavatta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67221440991edb035c5f6938","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanna Janikowska","original_name":"Joanna Janikowska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67221569d9a8a77b5da44c19","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2857,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nHexdTpaWAECf67VzCgFdFF7Y1b.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m8KCatrC15NYvS4psObCTtWggIH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Watch Docs","release_date":"2024-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
