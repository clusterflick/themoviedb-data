Believed to be extinct, the seed has been described in the diaries of a colonial botanist to be related to curative uses by pre-Columbian cultures, as well as to induce altered states of consciousness. Three female characters will carry the seed in a three chapter structure. Suspended in time, the seed is the medium that activates dialogues between the pre-Columbian world, colonial ruins, the unfnished project of modernity and a post-capitalist future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Estados generales","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mauricio Freyre","original_name":"Mauricio Freyre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61770259cf4b8b0042916c8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
