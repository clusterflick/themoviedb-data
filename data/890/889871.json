At that time, the communists, currently three million people, built 750,000 bunkers. The bunkers are everywhere: in cities, yards, cemeteries and playgrounds across the country. After communism, the bunkers were used in different ways by the albanian citizens: they became pizzerias, bars, museums and hostels. The bunkers are used symbolically in the film, to report what is left of the communist dictatorship.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jCk3XVKKWNtmfW99jzvaNNsEiys.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sigurimi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2688526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luigjina Shkupa","original_name":"Luigjina Shkupa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617744312fccee004377ea87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1074,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jCk3XVKKWNtmfW99jzvaNNsEiys.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
