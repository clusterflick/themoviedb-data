Nikesh is already building his life in Warsaw – here, he has friends and lives like a young European. His dad wants to raise his son as a Nepalese and does everything he can to provide for the family. As a result, Shiv’s life comes down to working several jobs and constant confrontations with his son. Shiv is torn between his wife, who cannot imagine growing old in Poland, and his son, who cannot imagine growing up in Nepal.","popularity":0.1505,"poster_path":"/z2dgL9h9QierLYB5E1iO429hGRP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82295,"logo_path":"/h7Wuug2O9Ebouge4rSzeXgmNbWE.png","name":"Koi Studio","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":125737,"logo_path":"/v4YRjUXtET5EqW2XXYB05K3yUpd.png","name":"Mazowiecki Instytut Kultury","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":250,"logo_path":"/evWKasiElVQywuKv2dI72P9twz8.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2023-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Distances","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matej Bobrik","original_name":"Matej Bobrik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6174bd04b6c264006484f024","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2365361,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Filip Drożdż","original_name":"Filip Drożdż","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548f12e1ac2927b2c81551f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3860729,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tymoteusz Witczak","original_name":"Tymoteusz Witczak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548f141532acb01380c0fd9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matej Bobrik","original_name":"Matej Bobrik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548f116fd4f8000c7fd50ba","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2099740,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sabina Filipowicz","original_name":"Sabina Filipowicz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548f1352866fa00c4252fa9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897693,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Agnieszka Skalska","original_name":"Agnieszka Skalska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548f11e924ce60101f56d52","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28089888","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pBVxCM7Jg3VexGBlwbLwiWQ8frS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1726,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z2dgL9h9QierLYB5E1iO429hGRP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1151}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
