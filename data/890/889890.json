Born into a middle-class family in 1929, Ilse Fuskova was a flight attendant, a journalist, pronounced herself a feminist in 1978, in the midst of the military dictatorship, and in 1986, upon the return from the Latin American Meeting of Women in Bertioga, she recognized herself as a lesbian. Due to her skillful handling of human relationships, and inspired by European experiences, Ilse soon became involved with the entire range of militants and organizations between the 70s and 90s. She became a key figure when she broke into the main media in the 90s, assuming her lesbianism publicly, spreading concepts and opening the debate to the whole society.","popularity":0.0589,"poster_path":"/17uvtNSwVrGv9qXZdER6bPxT1S3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87308,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sombracine Producciones","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2021-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ilse Fuskova","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3303115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilse Fuskova","original_name":"Ilse Fuskova","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"618ac87266a7c30064b9df12","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3303116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Carrasco","original_name":"Adriana Carrasco","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"618ac87b8c7b0f004393b3bd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3303117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Rachid","original_name":"María Rachid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"618ac88269d28000449cafb3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3303118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Maffía","original_name":"Diana Maffía","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"618ac895ddd52d0026c1c4e2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3303119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Belluci","original_name":"Mabel Belluci","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"618ac89b160e730093588b05","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3303120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Laura Rosa","original_name":"María Laura Rosa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"618ac89e7ac82900434a816c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liliana Furió","original_name":"Liliana Furió","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61775579e9da69008f880273","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1769533,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucas Santa Ana","original_name":"Lucas Santa Ana","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/njPD7GePwF6YNJZYWOmbBP6epKW.jpg","credit_id":"617755845294e7002a416224","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3260973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Juárez","original_name":"Adriana Juárez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618ac7666e0d720042467244","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1769533,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucas Santa Ana","original_name":"Lucas Santa Ana","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/njPD7GePwF6YNJZYWOmbBP6epKW.jpg","credit_id":"618ac759ddd52d0042c3c089","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3303113,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paula Maffía","original_name":"Paula Maffía","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618ac8231cfe3a008d53ad5a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2699163,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mariano A.
