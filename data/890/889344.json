I've been trying to fulfil her absence since and take care of my closest male relatives: my dad who is left alone after 30 years of marriage, my brother ZALÁN who can't find his place in the world, and my cousin BENDEGÚZ, a father of a 2 year-old still putting alcohol and partying in front of everything else. I’m 36 now and I want to stop the patterns I’ve been repeating, so I’m starting a transgenerational therapy. DON’T WORRY, SARI! is a situative documentary. The therapy sessions will give a frame to the film and in between we see a personal family saga. For that we’ll use footage that my mother and later I have been filming since the 1980s: situative scenes, voice recorded dreams, archives and voice messages.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Worry, Sari!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2648915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sári Haragonics","original_name":"Sári Haragonics","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617588d8172d7f002efb9f1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
