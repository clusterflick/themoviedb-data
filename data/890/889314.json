Rock band singer in Salt Lake City. Dealer. Former Marine in Iraq. Discharged from the Army before leaving for Afghanistan. Terrorism suspect. Hitman for the Tijuana cartels. On the verge of suicide. He is now finishing law school at San Diego University. Daniel Torres shares his adventures with his friend Erasmo in a road movie from Utah National Park to the Mexican frontier. An intimate story, funny and sensitive, far from the clich√©s of virility.
