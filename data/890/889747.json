The film portrays his life throughout the seasons, with other people occasionally crossing into his otherwise solitary life. At the heart a song, an argument between life and death, each stating their case to rule over the world. The film is without exposition, it aims at something less recognisable, a different existence of reality observed in discrete moments. A sequel to Two Years at Sea (2011), charting a subtly changing life in a radically changing world.","popularity":0.3994,"poster_path":"/cSs6ca9zDEz6BYroEVJrmPrMTlc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94594,"logo_path":"/g7w57j6Iyp1bsIj4ZnbwStIhfEP.png","name":"Flaneur
