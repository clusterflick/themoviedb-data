But occasionally some visitors come to her flat. Through them and the voice of Antonio López (Dream of Light, Víctor Erice), the only painter who remembers her, we shape a multifaceted film. This is a cinematic portrait, which well into the film takes a surprising turn. A film that reflects on memory and oblivion, art and the creative process; posing the question of what it means to be an artist and a woman.","popularity":0.1926,"poster_path":"/mWZmW7fzvOtDwTCuktWOBoIeNNA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56548,"logo_path":null,"name":"59 en Conserva","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":133965,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cedro Plátano","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Visit and a Secret Garden","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"The Visit and the Secret Garden","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3671050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Santaló","original_name":"Isabel Santaló","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6301424d7d41aa0081534372","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio López García","original_name":"Antonio López García","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qZjtvCrSpgGtpAiYjD5L2B8Rkrb.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"63014226fb5299007a760b92","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1481855,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Irene M.
