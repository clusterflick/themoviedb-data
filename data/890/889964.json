Its form changes depending on the circumstance as well as by the personas that alternate and define it. It is not necessarily presented as a literal intoxication but also as an emotional one. The subject experiences a communion, a spiritual encounter that co-exists with a rapture, the division of the soul, its departure from the Sensible World. The individual limits fade away, the subjects lose their outlines and their privacy; they cling to a dissimilarity that lacks a specific shape. The body turns into a place of observation, its pulse, its signs and its facial expressions recorded. As every state of influence and intoxication evolves, it registers on the body, leaving its mark behind.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eT1YMnOigl3uhBrqofWo6kjyULx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rausch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vera Chotzoglou","original_name":"Vera Chotzoglou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61777a452fccee002a93bebc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eT1YMnOigl3uhBrqofWo6kjyULx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
