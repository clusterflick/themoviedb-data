It’s a story that hasn’t been heard before, presenting a compelling, intimate and nuanced portrayal of Roma which raises bigger questions about the identity of post-Brexit Britain. The film’s three protagonists represent a generation of young Roma whose parents immigrated to the UK in the nineties and the start of the new millennium. In Britain, they’ve received opportunities that had been denied to them in their native Slovakia and the Czech Republic, and as a result, they’ve grown to become educated and confident Europeans. As their lives are interrupted by Brexit and Covid, this film is shot by them with great intimacy, honesty and charm.","popularity":0.0532,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One More Question","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1778987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mira Erdevički","original_name":"Mira Erdevički","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617585738ddc34008e4f62b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
