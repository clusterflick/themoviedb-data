The next-frame-prediction technology is trying to predict the future based on just a couple of seconds from each clip, producing surprisingly hallucinatory video outputs, engaging with surrealist and expressionist painting tradition. The AI-produced material is arranged by the human artist in a narrative reflecting on the tenderness of the human body, the implications of AI interacting with it, and the politics of its usage.  We are a viral breath, one embodiment, connected to each other physically, socially and psychologically. Now it's becoming mediated by machines, controlled by corporations and governments. The work explores senses of touch and body as seen by algorithmic processes.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/bDOZtEh8UIL9H7KLPR9USzg64py.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Body is a Gesture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guli Silberstein","original_name":"Guli Silberstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gz9uRztvQT7lQzaAc030EmhO6qv.jpg","credit_id":"6176a62da097dc002aa2a376","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bDOZtEh8UIL9H7KLPR9USzg64py.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Transient Visions: Festival of the Moving Image","release_date":"2021-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
