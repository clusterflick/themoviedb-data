Mixing fiction, web footage of demos around the world and documentary, Hyperion Has Escaped reinterprets a mythical figure (Hyperion) and launches him into our reality in order to confront him with its madness and violence. Beginning as an elegy, making many detours in the absurd and ending almost as a child’s joke about eternity, it is also an invitation to build a new alliance with nature.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tv18jW2Mrw6ILBjD1LzcwPO8pjS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hyperion ist entflohen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1408627,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arnaud Gerber","original_name":"Arnaud Gerber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6174bc4765e0a200448758f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tv18jW2Mrw6ILBjD1LzcwPO8pjS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
