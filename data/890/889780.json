When I watched them, I realized that he had a comprehensive video diary, that he is a lover of images, and that he recorded everything as if he had been mandated by a public administrator to create memories. I see myself surrounded by them in his archives. They are my uncles, cousins and grandfathers – all policemen. My childhood with my family was surrounded by the PDI, Chile’s investigative police. Guns, badges, uniforms, gunshots. Almost all the men in my family are policemen. I look at my uncle’s images, at these ordinary men, even though I don’t know what that means. The story, the archives, the future, the violence and the police. Men and police as an inescapable relationship to think about.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":150159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transparaíso","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"I’ll Never be a Cop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2542243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Moscoso Briceno","original_name":"Carolina Moscoso Briceno","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6177097bfdc4fa002a9c891f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2542243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Moscoso Briceno","original_name":"Carolina Moscoso Briceno","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6390aca7f36a32009655173b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2542243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Moscoso Briceno","original_name":"Carolina Moscoso Briceno","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6390ac9ebbe1dd00917d16d9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2542243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Moscoso Briceno","original_name":"Carolina Moscoso Briceno","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6390aca3f10a1a0084734305","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
