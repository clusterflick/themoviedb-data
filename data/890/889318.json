Yet recently it has also become a border within a frozen conflict between Moldova and an unrecognised breakaway state – Transnistria. The future of an entire nation depends on whether the people residing on the riverbanks will learn to see how the state of the river reflects their lives. In the film, the river Nistru serves as a metaphor for both time and fate, the mirror of human life and self-reflection and finally as a magic talisman, which is an indispensable part of mythical journeys.","popularity":0.0534,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":172880,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baltic Balkan Productions","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"MD","name":"Moldova"}],"release_date":"2023-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nistru.
