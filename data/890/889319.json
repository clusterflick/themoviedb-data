In the summer of his 16th birthday, Matias finds the memories of his grandfather Gerald, in the form of an old photo album titled “Jugend\" (“Youth\"). In one of the most striking photos, Gerald, then also 16, wears a Nazi uniform, and looks disturbingly like Matias. Over the 80 years that separate them, a bridge emerges, triggering a long journey across Europe, itself haunted by the amnesiac resurgence of nationalism, echoing the too recent history of the old continent.","popularity":0.0507,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Youth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1166278,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mariana Gaivão","original_name":"Mariana Gaivão","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/ljnegppV3hY3Sohu06p95b8OmKE.jpg","credit_id":"617579159ee0ef002cece43f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
