He added an overpainting to the film, respecting the actions of the protagonists so that the characters would react to the coloured flying objects. Pilař made the untitled material into a video screener called A Film Sketch 1965 (ca. 1984), and later edited it with video effects under the title Painting into the Air (ca. 1991).","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Painting in the Air","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Radek Pilař","original_name":"Radek Pilař","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61747628176a9400853c0556","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
