In Hippie we see a movie star move to a remote spiritual community while being followed by a documentary film crew. Causing chaos he destroys the life of those who live there through his obsessionsâ€™ with sex, drugs, murder and being famous. There is no escape for anyone, including the indigneous community who claim it as their ancestral land and want to stop it being sold off to a multinational, which they suspect Brand works for.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hippie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grace Ndiritu","original_name":"Grace Ndiritu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61771a66924ce50044231f91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
