They experience issues of language loss, identity loss, and lately, an ecological disaster. Formerly lush and green, today the Nogai steppe is turning into a desert. In the autumn, the team led by a simple woman named Gulfira goes deep into the new desert for several months. Every day they walk for many kilometres under the icy, sandy wind and plant branches of Juzgun – a shrub with long roots that can stop the sand. Will Gulfira survive in this battle for the homeland, or will the Nogai land disappear along with its people?","popularity":0.0867,"poster_path":"/jBImBMHF2uhlueFsca3ROp6V4V3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Against The Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Protiv vetra","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2040488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatyana Soboleva","original_name":"Tatyana Soboleva","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/eAuWcZ69QGgdIYwYj2Uhrrol3EI.jpg","credit_id":"617568b2cadb6b0062d9d1bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2040488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatyana Soboleva","original_name":"Tatyana Soboleva","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/eAuWcZ69QGgdIYwYj2Uhrrol3EI.jpg","credit_id":"667c8fcd8e667ed9185580df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4796788,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniyal Isakaev","original_name":"Daniyal Isakaev","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667c8fdc258abc6b9f16cf34","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2013178,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikita Aniskin","original_name":"Nikita Aniskin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669610677771839d2273afe3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2087424,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tatyana Vikhreva","original_name":"Tatyana Vikhreva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669610be99a1f9ef02fd98d1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2040488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatyana Soboleva","original_name":"Tatyana Soboleva","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/eAuWcZ69QGgdIYwYj2Uhrrol3EI.jpg","credit_id":"669610c6ba70ce2d69f3b168","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2040488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatyana Soboleva","original_name":"Tatyana Soboleva","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/eAuWcZ69QGgdIYwYj2Uhrrol3EI.jpg","credit_id":"669610ce7771839d2273afeb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/jBImBMHF2uhlueFsca3ROp6V4V3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gorky New Russian Cinema Film Festival","release_date":"2024-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOKer Moscow International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Golden Raven Arctic International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
