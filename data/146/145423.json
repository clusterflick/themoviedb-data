How can one love, today? The answers given by Stefano Consiglio and the couples he met in four European countries are scandalously normal, simple like the feelings of a group of children who open this story of many voices. Can homosexual love be lived in the harmony, clarity, contradictions, passions and duration that have always been common models in speaking of feelings? The incredible naturalness of the subjects in the film is powerful and destined to leave an impression on our reflections. As are the shame of marginalization, fear and diffidence of which Aldo Nove speaks in the brief novella that precedes the life stories that weave the plot, in between the explosions of color of Ursula Ferraraâ€™s animated designs.","popularity":0.1332,"poster_path":"/ora7PBwFznA0QrMdDlDyak7IxCW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":779,"logo_path":"/KFFOFoztyjV5epvnW5GerPbcvx.png","name":"Lucky Red","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2009-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hymn to Love","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Zingaretti","original_name":"Luca Zingaretti","popularity":0.5971,"profile_path":"/yHvitzNxavhVt6uK0Vf4ktZDAhh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b5a9251416c75100405","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122717,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Francesco Di Giacomo","original_name":"Francesco Di Giacomo","popularity":0.0951,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b5a9251416c75100401","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefano Consiglio","original_name":"Stefano Consiglio","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b5a9251416c751003fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1556650","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lbdiuOr5iooTndc8k70rboyHxQJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1812,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/ora7PBwFznA0QrMdDlDyak7IxCW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1208}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
