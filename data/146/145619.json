In this piece smaller circles oscillate in and out in an array of colors resembling a kaleidoscope while being accompanied with Indian sitar music. The patterns become hypnotic and trance inducing. This work clearly correlates the auditory and the visual and is a wonderful example of the concept of synaesthesia.","popularity":0.1344,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lapis","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":23,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Whitney","original_name":"James Whitney","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b5e9251416c75100b9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0380493","wikidata_id":"Q64995744","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Cinematheque 16, Los Angeles","release_date":"1966-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
