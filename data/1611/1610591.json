This artistic performance, that went well beyond the boundaries imposed by the radiophonic medium and was aimed towards the abolition of the transcendental/hierarchical mode of control and punishment which structures the bare corpse of society, was censored due to external nefarious forces directed towards the restriction and suppression of the dynamitard body of Antonin Artaud (former Antonin Nelpas), after his liberation from a 10-year detention in the Rodez sanatorium.  Through his ritualistic intonation, echoing the ancient dionysiac sonic dimension of theatre, the revelation is therefore clear: disorganise the rigid organisms (dispositifs) of power to free the bodies from the sickness called Spirit.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/2Q0LLzVaqBKlyJXB1NhNjfJRanP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117263,"logo_path":"/fel0PKWigARrdOGvxQbZ2T1hCV5.png","name":"Radio France","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1948-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"IN WHICH ANTONIN ARTAUD REVEALS THE ULTIMATE TRUTH ABOUT THE FRAUDOLENT FALSIFICATION OF GOD!","title":"Pour en finir avec le jugement de dieu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonin Artaud","original_name":"Antonin Artaud","popularity":1.0828,"profile_path":"/dIMl6oIhK7Yid3do0dGHQ7Wxjza.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"695c29a5371d4f126b4d4f14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5920592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Cesarès","original_name":"Maria Cesarès","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"695c29e373d336b9ce8453ea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Blin","original_name":"Roger Blin","popularity":3.8613,"profile_path":"/6C8jvXlBpgzbIHpflhGCw4XIFKt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"695c29fa61d184eaf18454ff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3534075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paule Thevenin","original_name":"Paule Thevenin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"695c2a1d61d184eaf184550b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonin Artaud","original_name":"Antonin Artaud","popularity":1.0828,"profile_path":"/dIMl6oIhK7Yid3do0dGHQ7Wxjza.jpg","credit_id":"695c2a570c0bd0e7fc17be5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonin Artaud","original_name":"Antonin Artaud","popularity":1.0828,"profile_path":"/dIMl6oIhK7Yid3do0dGHQ7Wxjza.jpg","credit_id":"695c2a69e2c6e5467217be6f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gMBArhPCc0m00Ju19omdVXUsCpg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_3166_1":"FR","iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2Q0LLzVaqBKlyJXB1NhNjfJRanP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"It was actually censored by Radio France","release_date":"1948-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
