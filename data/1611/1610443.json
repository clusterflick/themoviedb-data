A set of long static takes, punctuated by small movements, depicts some of the precinct's features (sealed or half-dilapidated façades, partially dismantled attractions), retracing a route within the premises. Intended to force the focus of perception, the film explores the links between temporal experience and the visual and aural grasp of a specific place.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nocturno","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280098,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"João Nisa","original_name":"João Nisa","popularity":0.2,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695be23d30a36fe3e0845129","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
