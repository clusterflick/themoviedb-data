It looks at structures in the photographic material and treats the tactile surface instead of its representations of reality. The high frequency of images - eight per second - challenges our capacity to recognize patterns, our brains begin to blend the images together. The flowery bouquets of fireworks blends in with the curvy lines of leaves, the forest looks as if painted, and the impressionist method of mixing all the colours of the rainbow mirrors itself in the neon hues of exploding firework. 'Flora' compares the digital archives of the internet with the memory of the viewer, and favours association over analysis, pictorial qualities over contextual meaning.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2580615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeppe Lange","original_name":"Jeppe Lange","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695c8c414ca160ef45178e01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35608719","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
