Taking the stage for the first time since she was expelled without due process after speaking out about alleged harassment, Rebecca leads an all-volunteer orchestra in an unforgettable evening of music. Internationally acclaimed musicians, violinist Lara St. John and oboist Katherine Needleman, bring the stage to life with works by composers who themselves faced censorship, from Mozart to Shostakovich.  Between performances, FIRE staff and special guests reflect on why free expression is essential for artists, and for all of us.  The arts cannot thrive without free expression.  Thank you to everyone who made this night possible!","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outspoken: Music for Free Speech","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5919548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Bryant Novak","original_name":"Rebecca Bryant Novak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"695bca9c143d30dbabd7a47e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5749168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lara St. John","original_name":"Lara St. John","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Violinist","credit_id":"695bcaabcd9e311da14b0169","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5919550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angel Eduardo","original_name":"Angel Eduardo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Host","credit_id":"695bcab9b9d59305f2cc0158","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5919552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Needleman","original_name":"Katherine Needleman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Oboist","credit_id":"695bcadaf4f88c6118d7a294","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5919554,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William Harris","original_name":"William Harris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695bcaffd257e773157c845a","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2741516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ronald Baez","original_name":"Ronald Baez","popularity":0.3601,"profile_path":"/l0uGpSvuft2EOWvUtBPGRvy0eFV.jpg","credit_id":"695bcb10151701c5a77c8a43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5919556,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bruce Jones","original_name":"Bruce Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695bcb28a9d9a4e3c575099a","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5919559,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Logan Mack","original_name":"Logan Mack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695bcb38d721a2cf0fc3b2ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5919562,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Logan Mack","original_name":"Logan Mack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695bcb4a00f16f5deed7a508","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5919563,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Justin Bondi","original_name":"Justin Bondi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695bcb5f25713176bbd7d156","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39226750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":156205,"name":"concert film"},{"id":230089,"name":"free speech"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"},{"id":303954,"name":"art documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
