The film centers on Nontok, a loyal yet mistreated guardian in the celestial realm whose duty leaves him subjected to constant humiliation by the angels, slowly fueling his resentment and inner turmoil. When divine forces grant him extraordinary power, Nontok’s struggle between duty, pride, and vengeance begins to threaten the balance of the universe, prompting the gods to take action. Rich in traditional Thai imagery, emotional depth, and spiritual symbolism, the movie examines themes of karma, justice, and the consequences of power, setting the stage for a legendary confrontation that shapes the fate of the worlds.","popularity":0.2,"poster_path":"/pjZXniaIv90q6KvheLUT184BI9B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When
