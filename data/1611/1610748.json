For one weekend, these blind and low-vision kids aren’t the minority in the room, as they make new friends, go head-to-head against old ones, and strive for the rare opportunity to be recognized for something besides their disability. Empowering them to be the filmmakers, BRAILLED IT gives the kids cameras and has them document the event on their own. Their often-disorienting cinematography challenges sighted audiences to follow the action on the kids’ terms, with audio description and binaural sound recording helping viewers understand this unique cinematic world through non-visual cues. Ultimately, the kids’ charmingly honest, intimate, and emotional footage makes accessible to all audiences the human drama of their experience and the true power of literacy for all.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1bF9YDPLQyRCILq9HcJIDFqaQLF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Filmed by the blind, for the blind","title":"Brailled It","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39223565","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1bF9YDPLQyRCILq9HcJIDFqaQLF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
