At the end of every year, they open the jar and read all the good things life gave them.  But this year has been different.  Ritu is secretly drowning in anxiety.\r Dev is quietly facing repeated job rejections.  Neither wants to burden the other.  So, each begins writing fake “happy moments” just to keep the jar alive for the other.  On the final day of the year, when they open the jar together, they uncover dozens of fake notes — realizing both were pretending, both were protecting each other, and both were silently falling apart.  Two people sacrifice truth for each other, only to discover the other did the same.  Film ends with them finally writing their first real notes of the year and exchange with eachother, acknowledging the most precious gift, the truth, and agreeing to heal together.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two people sacrifice truth for each other, only to discover the other did the same.","title":"The Memory Jar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
