Labarthe and Sophie Barrouyer. The reunion triggers memories of that shared filming; together they reflect on the traces that the film and their childhoods have left on them. The filmed faces of those three children overlap with their own adult gazes, the Paris of 1983 merges with that of 2023. Time thus becomes the main character in this film.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los niños perdidos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2173728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriela Guillermo","original_name":"Gabriela Guillermo","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/pl7g5g9EZj9DH1af7NDW9z8i26h.jpg","credit_id":"67f590426c3583c9759994a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2857090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Raffo","original_name":"Irina Raffo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f59052eddec28b03adeaf1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"43rd International Film Festival of Uruguay","release_date":"2025-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
