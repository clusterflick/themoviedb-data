The system demands that she find a home, but due to lack of resources, Noa squats in an apartment from which she is about to be evicted. Her cousin Mary Karmen, an intersex Roma squatter activist, is her loyal companion, along with other friends living on the margins: Nani, a drug addict and pickpocket, and Luana, a homeless Portuguese singer. The solidarity and sisterhood among them all—infused with art and a surprising sense of humor—push them to survive their harsh realities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Corren las liebres","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5359573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorena Ros","original_name":"Lorena Ros","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f67b3fddf9194387da52e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5359573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorena Ros","original_name":"Lorena Ros","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f728fdd4c444a1cc995b53","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5361037,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roger Menduiña","original_name":"Roger Menduiña","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f729087b43bdce20adfbc2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
