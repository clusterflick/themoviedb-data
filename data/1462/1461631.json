Her solitude is only hindered by the ‘Sistema Único de Salud’, which summons her for a new compulsory vaccination that she does not want to comply with, and she has only five days to solve the problem. Time moves forward between memories and encounters that Lucía has with her partner, her best friend and an unexpected visitor. In a poetic key, the film proposes a reflection on individual freedom and freedom of thought as the last trench in the face of a coercive system.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/rV1YOg4bDNX39EEGePgmvnezF4V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2025-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5393862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julieta Lucena","original_name":"Julieta Lucena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"680a71b7778b4626739d1617","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5393864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastián Martinelli","original_name":"Sebastián Martinelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"680a71c4e92f940ca69d1bc5","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":236377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariana Arias","original_name":"Mariana Arias","popularity":2.531,"profile_path":"/3wNIRNzIGpmntMESEkXdPCQKiQG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"680a71e9b2b722aedf8a5f8c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pablo Pipolo","original_name":"Pablo Pipolo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"680a71f7e92f940ca69d1be5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5393867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ignacio Estévez","original_name":"Ignacio Estévez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"680a71ffac02d4407babb995","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5393869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soledad Lacassy","original_name":"Soledad Lacassy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"680a721c271ecb3ae08a283b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5393871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilia Palacios","original_name":"Emilia Palacios","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"680a7230ac02d4407babb9ad","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5393872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camila Cayota","original_name":"Camila Cayota","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"680a723a271ecb3ae08a2854","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5393877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Lucena","original_name":"Carlos Lucena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"680a72bf271ecb3ae08a2874","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2743417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adriana Nartallo","original_name":"Adriana Nartallo","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f58c366c3583c9759992a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2135347,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daniel Amorin","original_name":"Daniel Amorin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f58c47240e6599689941fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2135347,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daniel Amorin","original_name":"Daniel Amorin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680a732d15a1d5a614ab2d96","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1796137,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victoria Pérez","original_name":"Victoria Pérez","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680a7371f3cf6d66d79d1809","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rV1YOg4bDNX39EEGePgmvnezF4V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"43rd International Film Festival of Uruguay","release_date":"2025-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
