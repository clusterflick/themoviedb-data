He was born with one leg longer than the other. He spent the last two years of elementary school bedridden in the hospital, due to an experimental treatment. Returning back to his village, he began to go to church often, so he chose to become a monk. During his ordination, he goes from secular George to Father John and leaves the capital and the opportunities for professional development to return to a remote but beautiful place.
