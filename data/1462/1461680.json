Through personal memories and reflections from those who knew him—such as fellow artist Willem de Kooning, de Kooning’s wife Elaine, and other contemporaries—the film paints a vivid portrait of Kline’s personality, artistic spirit, and lasting influence. Known for his powerful black and white compositions and bold brushwork, Kline is remembered not only for his art, but also for his wit, warmth, and passionate approach to painting. The episode explores both his creative process and the deep friendships that shaped his career.","popularity":0.3797,"poster_path":"/96O6DUi62AnoweACaXa2Yg8NLFo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Franz Kline - Remembered","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Kline","original_name":"Franz Kline","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67f5ace1ddf9194387da1af2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willem de Kooning","original_name":"Willem de Kooning","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67f5acef6c3583c975999a8b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2036174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elaine de Kooning","original_name":"Elaine de Kooning","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67f5acfd6c3583c975999aa5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Pollock","original_name":"Jackson Pollock","popularity":0.1003,"profile_path":"/ikd3hTqkPuCXaqzcyKnGZMWPmjr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67f5ad07ddf9194387da1b13","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Guston","original_name":"Philip Guston","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67f5ad1aa5471a51ee99b00a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dustin Hoffman","original_name":"Dustin Hoffman","popularity":1.8965,"profile_path":"/yFjTzJHE6AFbwQifOlnNDzmiwlq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67f5ad6e701b75bfe9ad149a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5358710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Colby","original_name":"Carl Colby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f5bed9ea80d85175991bff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5358536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Courtney Sale Ross","original_name":"Courtney Sale Ross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f5bf238cfccf7bafd9afff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5358715,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Francis Kenny","original_name":"Francis Kenny","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f5bf658cfccf7bafd9b019","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1627481,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ken Eluto","original_name":"Ken Eluto","popularity":0.1297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f5bf856c3583c975999c5d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5358716,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maurice Wright","original_name":"Maurice Wright","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f5bfc28cfccf7bafd9b049","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2531298","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/96O6DUi62AnoweACaXa2Yg8NLFo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":244180,"name":"abstract expressionism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Strokes of Genius Franz Kline Remembered","key":"F6WkT4LhZZk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2024-10-28T17:01:32.000Z","id":"67f5add8ddf9194387da1b73"}]}}}
