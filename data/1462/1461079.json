Twice turned down by \"Menudo\" for being too short, Ricky Martin (born Enrique Martin Morales) joined the boy band at the age of 12 and emerged as a teen heartthrob. Five years later, he was on his own, singing in 5 languages, propelling Latin pop to mainstream music. There was Mexican theater, a TV show, and then an American soap opera and sitcom along the way. The child who began as a choir altar boy and sang fast food TV ads in Puerto Rico would transcend his \"Livin' La Vida Loca\" lyrics and reveal his true self as a gay man. A six-year marriage, 4 children by surrogacy, and divorce would follow. Some may call it \"A Loco Life.\"","popularity":0.4297,"poster_path":"/hhKfJ8EMQv3491m7rB3he4Fq6Sf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13493,"logo_path":"/1K6FYi17dmSIMIvBDHIxtFqQWP.png","name":"Entertain ME","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":114488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entertain Me Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":161839,"logo_path":null,"name":"Legacy Distribution","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ricky Martin: A Loco Life","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricky Martin","original_name":"Ricky Martin","popularity":0.5819,"profile_path":"/mAkdpTplDii6otg5fWli74K44o5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67f4299c31c9f27299ad2ded","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5356007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Randall","original_name":"Nick Randall","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f42ae67b43bdce20ad4cb0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36163190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wVUzkUw7GYtNoNp72Z2s7XC8zPj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hhKfJ8EMQv3491m7rB3he4Fq6Sf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":259285,"name":"gay artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
