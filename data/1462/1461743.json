This inaugural documentary, produced by the Oral History Lab (OHL) and sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities, focuses on the ways in which layered disasters—interwoven within the context of a complex economic and political landscape—further eroded an already unstable local food system at both the production and agricultural distribution levels.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qaShclJCDu1JMp3LtGHZEDhlkXb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuestro Pedazo de Tierra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5358956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Carolina","original_name":"Andrea Carolina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f5f1eb8cfccf7bafd9bf2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5358957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego J.
