Cristina and Fabián live on the street. They met and what they felt was love at first sight. When their daughter was born, the baby was kept in the hospital because she had no home to take her to. Throughout the film, Cristina doesn't give up: we see her doubling her efforts to try to get her daughter back. Jonathan and Vanessa have been dating for years. Little by little, drugs have consumed their lives until they are left on the street. While they go through a spiral of aggression, they try to give up the addiction and give each other a second chance. Some time ago, Maria discovered that she has HIV. She decided not to tell Jonatan for fear that he would abandon her; when he found out about the disease, he decided to forgive her and continue their relationship. However, from that moment on, they both suffered conflicts and mistreatment.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2024-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El amor duerme en la calle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1866845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guzmán García","original_name":"Guzmán García","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/AgO2Fgwkm6EOECeq5SS0RSvloXA.jpg","credit_id":"67f58de0240e659968994276","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"43rd International Film Festival of Uruguay","release_date":"2025-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
