Using the song as a determining framework, the film is edited so that picture and sound recorded on consecutive days are juxtaposed in each verse. The film is partly concerned with the abstract tensions produced by the day to day variations in picture and sound, but it also plays upon any expectations which arise from familiarity with the carol. Through repetition, nonsensical juxtapositions of word and image start to acquire their own unfathomable meanings. â€“ J.S.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"7P","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Smith","original_name":"John Smith","popularity":0.2227,"profile_path":"/5Iq1Owl6v9qdISFEyC4q5PEBao3.jpg","credit_id":"67f423b38cfccf7bafd91bfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
