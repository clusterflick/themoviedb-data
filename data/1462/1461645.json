La quinta de los secretos","overview":"A documentary-poem, a letter sent to someone one admires. Constructed as a musical composition, it alternates fragments of concerts filmed at Renée's home with archival footage, paintings she painted, drawings, photos, and interviews. Seated on a bench in her garden, she awaits us. She tells us a few secrets: what it's like to live traveling back and forth across the Atlantic, between Paris and Montevideo, her two loves. Rodolfo Panzacchi, a good friend, comes over for tea. They talk about music, about children who love pizzicato, and about the soul of violins. She converses with a thrush, reveals the secret of electroacoustic scores, and, on her piano, offers us a wonderful milonga. This documentary doesn't aim to tell us about the life of a famous musician, but rather to bring us up close to her as if on tiptoe and allow her soul, like that of violins, to reveal itself through her art.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Renée Pietrafesa Bonnet.
