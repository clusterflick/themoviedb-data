A man suffers from a terrible disease: the impotence to love. In a desperate attempt to survive, he rents a young woman for a few nights, in whose body he hopes to find the life he is losing, has lost or never had. Amidst the moans of sex, in the tumult of the sheets, she only perceives in this man the throes of an irremediable death.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2024-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La enfermedad de la muerte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2173728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriela Guillermo","original_name":"Gabriela Guillermo","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/pl7g5g9EZj9DH1af7NDW9z8i26h.jpg","credit_id":"67f58e84701b75bfe9ad0ec2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
