Juxtaposing these two unlikely works would of course highlight differences within our sensibilities, but what was more compelling to me was to shed light on what we have in common. Each of us works within a layered, complex, and quite rigorous language of our own making; my guess is that the three of us hold a deep respect for the audience, and so seek ways within our unique media to create space, agency, and desire whereby each spectator may form her/his own meaning. But in no way did I anticipate the spark and mysterious deep resonance I experienced when I put these works together in a single piece. I’ve come to think of 2 x 2 as my “e-motion diptych” – and as a project that seems to transcend the unique sensibilities of each of us.","popularity":0.2034,"poster_path":"/yDQscZYX6UTMoYKfhigmfMT1lmN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2 X 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1135813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Holly Fisher","original_name":"Holly Fisher","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/AjmBUj9GQm8qUW3NVw1ccmQe6Ir.jpg","credit_id":"67f57d98ddf9194387da1046","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oVffN1NiIaS2Sj51H9JCcY6ObK2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yDQscZYX6UTMoYKfhigmfMT1lmN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
