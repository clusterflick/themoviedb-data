In this specific film, the viewer is shown scenarios in which rookie cops are exposed to the cynical attitudes and reckless actions of seasoned veterans. Here, the words and actions of the sergeants and other senior police officers appear contradictory to the code of conduct and what was taught to the trainees in the police academy. The goal of the film is to create a discussion about \"doing the right thing\" and, of course, to reinforce the code of conduct. The film was produced by Woroner Films, inc and scripts and research were carried out by Frank Augustine, Sam Harris, Miami Dade Community College, and Bal Harbour Police Department of Florida.","popularity":0.3943,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":109760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motorola Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":222166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Woroner Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patrolman, You Have a Problem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":796,"name":"police brutality"},{"id":6149,"name":"police"},{"id":177258,"name":"police training"},{"id":208310,"name":"patrolman"},{"id":221223,"name":"training video"},{"id":269189,"name":"police misconduct"},{"id":284946,"name":"cops"},{"id":333793,"name":"discussion"},{"id":335278,"name":"problem discussion"},{"id":349972,"name":"misconduct"},{"id":349973,"name":"traffic stop"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\" PATROLMAN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM \" 1970s POLICE MISCONDUCT TRAINING FILM    MIAMI DADE P.D.
