Club! Action!","overview":"War! Club! Action! is an ode to Douk Saga (1974-2006), the creator of the Ivorian-French  musical genre called Coupé Décalé. This popular music genre plays a great part in Oyiri’s  music practice with its maximalism and club culture ethos. Coupé Décalé was born in the  midst of the Ivorian political crisis and civil war yet the genre was always synonymous with a  raging optimism and hedonism. War! Club! Action! challenges the western idea of protest  music, entertainment and anonymity in the music industry. Oyiri deepens and makes explicit  the political meaning of Douk Saga's musical production by preceding its \"Douk Saga En Fête\"  video clip with an introductory sequence, as well as a mock interview of a fictional figure: DJ  Eminence Grise.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War!
