Padma, born into the privilege of a Nair family, dares to defy societal norms by falling in love with Chandu, a man from a tribal community. Their love, considered forbidden, triggers a brutal backlash. When Chandu becomes a victim of honor-driven violence, Padma is thrust into a harrowing choice vengeance or justice. What unfolds is a journey of transformation as she rises against oppression with fierce resilience. Directed by Anil Dev, *Uttavar* is not just a film—it’s a visceral experience, a bold statement against entrenched prejudice, and a tribute to the indomitable spirit of a woman who refuses to be silenced. Some stories demand to be heard *Uttavar* demands to be felt.","popularity":0.066,"poster_path":"/uBnwyKPwuWohS2hDadwHEp23ntk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":258966,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Fantasy [in]","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2025-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uttavar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1797953,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arun Narayanan","original_name":"Arun Narayanan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67f69fafd81748ccff991726","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5359870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Athira Sudheer","original_name":"Athira Sudheer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67f69fb6d4c444a1cc99439d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5359871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vishnu Vijayan Nair","original_name":"Vishnu Vijayan Nair","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67f69fbc7b43bdce20addeea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3711442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saji Sopanam","original_name":"Saji Sopanam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67f69fc21bc639566ad92beb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5359872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dora Bai","original_name":"Dora Bai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67f69fca7b43bdce20addef4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5359873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Mathew Punalur","original_name":"Roy Mathew Punalur","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67f69fd0d81748ccff991739","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5359874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asha Nair","original_name":"Asha Nair","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67f69fd67b43bdce20addf02","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885625,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anil Dev","original_name":"Anil Dev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f69fe631775276d6d90a26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885625,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anil Dev","original_name":"Anil Dev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f69ff8d3ab7d7a8bad0c3f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885625,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anil Dev","original_name":"Anil Dev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6a0046c3583c97599ce45","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3024912,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mridul S","original_name":"Mridul S","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6a019cce7690230acf08e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3024898,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fazil Razak","original_name":"Fazil Razak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6a0296c3583c97599ce58","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5359882,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ramgopal Harikrishnan","original_name":"Ramgopal Harikrishnan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6a0336c3583c97599ce62","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g1aFMNRIbgnAxNs0cRneeV1Hhjy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":754,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uBnwyKPwuWohS2hDadwHEp23ntk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ml","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
