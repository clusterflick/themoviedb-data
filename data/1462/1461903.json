One by one, we are introduced to a variety of characters: the play’s director, actors, and other ordinary people. As we delve further into each of their lives, the film reveals the startling parallels between the themes of the play and their own. Everyone is waiting for something: a permit to build a house, better work conditions, a starring role in a film. Much like Waiting for Godot, our heroes are awaiting Faraj Allah… something that may or may not come.","popularity":0.1372,"poster_path":"/dsXrSHYWkfMniNKoYrSTkgHTPJf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":258949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salimeh
