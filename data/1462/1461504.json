They had been asked by their student assembly to hand-deliver a memorandum on joining the university. But the Prime Minister refuses to receive them. For three months, every morning, politely, they will reiterate their request... Thirty years later, we are taking the Montreal-Quebec train with them.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'histoire des trois","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1775711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francine Laurendeau","original_name":"Francine Laurendeau","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67f55eb51bb047289999b50c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5358061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Goyer","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Goyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67f55ec8ddf9194387da03c6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5358063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Meloche","original_name":"Bruno Meloche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67f55ed631c9f27299ad6f8e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Duplessis","original_name":"Maurice Duplessis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cnCfgvhqvehqQHLhxPT0ucc8d6e.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67f55ee2ddf9194387da03e0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Claude Labrecque","original_name":"Jean-Claude Labrecque","popularity":0.0591,"profile_path":"/uW5lDCo5SgFle9bEQmm4J00rAN7.jpg","credit_id":"67f55f04240e65996899395d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575536,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Éric Michel","original_name":"Éric Michel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f55f22a5471a51ee99a140","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166702,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Werner Nold","original_name":"Werner Nold","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f55f331bb047289999b558","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5152507,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Drouin","original_name":"Jacques Drouin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f55f4731c9f27299ad6f9c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Claude Labrecque","original_name":"Jean-Claude Labrecque","popularity":0.0591,"profile_path":"/uW5lDCo5SgFle9bEQmm4J00rAN7.jpg","credit_id":"67f55f648cfccf7bafd98ddf","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265097,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernard Gosselin","original_name":"Bernard Gosselin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f55f727b43bdce20ad9864","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5358083,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"michel moreau","original_name":"michel moreau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f560afddf9194387da047c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0210729","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1jAigVBBCCsugA64Oo3JCGwZjJQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"L'histoire des trois","key":"O2-Vt57A3IA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2022-03-09T16:00:12.000Z","id":"67f561b2ddf9194387da04f0"}]}}}
