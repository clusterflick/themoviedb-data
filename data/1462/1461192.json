It's all complaining and no actual crisis. Until one night when a young man named Danny calls in saying he is going to kill three other people before killing himself. Simon gets Danny to unravel his story of betrayal, the dark web and dangerous relationships.  Originally re-titled and released as Crisis Hotline, the film-makers were not satisfied with the \"slasher-movie\" style marketing campaign. The film-makers have now restored the original title and extensively updated the physical elements of the film such as composing an all-new score, a sound design re-mix, a total color re-grade, a new pre-title sequence and re-edited scenes.","popularity":0.2983,"poster_path":"/yGhlf3N8ZRHbDuZ61v438YxMZC1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88774,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diamond in the Rough Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadows in Mind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2137933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Mizwicki","original_name":"Mike Mizwicki","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/dtKtvjSHpna0BVPNOn5awyf5UZ5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Curtis","credit_id":"67f480c01bb0472899998a06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1972140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pano Tsaklas","original_name":"Pano Tsaklas","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":"/5icYcrmQ2hxdalWPqdtlq7bshrs.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kyle","credit_id":"67f480d71bb0472899998a0e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2336739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Jackson","original_name":"Corey Jackson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Simon","credit_id":"67f483157b43bdce20ad62e0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2336740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"August Browning","original_name":"August Browning","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Lance","credit_id":"67f48326ddf9194387d9bbb0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Balunis","original_name":"Mark Balunis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Cafe customer","credit_id":"67f483381bb0472899998aac","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Schwab","original_name":"Mark Schwab","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f480518cfccf7bafd93505","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Schwab","original_name":"Mark Schwab","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f480618cfccf7bafd93508","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28634479","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/stvVZi5tJRi1Ujw7JxZieWPMlYv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qOEoBbzBL3Sv7wNqK2hfTKu8Pqg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2700,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yGhlf3N8ZRHbDuZ61v438YxMZC1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wQ9cDBvKhiJQElyeElp1f2Qw3Qp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shadows in Mind (2023) | LGBTQ+ Psychological Thriller | Full Movie","key":"1JE7zHMBzq0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-02T20:00:03.000Z","id":"67f484878cfccf7bafd9362a"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shadows In Mind Official Trailer (2024)| Thriller | LGBTQ+ | Breaking Glass Pictures","key":"fjZcW7FcoCE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2024-08-01T16:04:17.000Z","id":"67f48414ddf9194387d9bbf3"}]}}}
