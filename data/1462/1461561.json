Stripped of their status and limited in magical power, the trio faces a new challenge: navigating modern life. From failing at odd jobs to accidentally committing crimes, their attempts to blend in only make things worse. Just when all hope seems lost, a random act of kindness restores their spirits... only for them to immediately blow it on alcohol and junk food. What follows is a chaotic series of misadventures, culminating in their arrest and a hilariously awkward jailbreak. With no clue how to thrive on Earth, they have only one thing keeping them going — each other... sort of.","popularity":0.1295,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Three wizards.
