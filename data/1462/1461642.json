Through her story, she weaves together the history of her Jewish family, who escaped from Germany, and also that of her Nazi relatives who stayed behind. She tells of the love and heartbreak between her Jewish father and her German mother, the daughter of a Nazi, who declared her dead so she could continue working as an engineer building bunkers. The mingled blood of victims and murderers leads Ariel to wonder why something that happened 80 years ago still affects her life, exploring the ties of power, the relationships between parents and children, and the ways we as people deal with the legacy of our ancestors.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2025-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La mitad de mi familia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2850524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariel Wolf","original_name":"Ariel Wolf","popularity":0.1282,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f58fa76c3583c975999476","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"43rd International Film Festival of Uruguay","release_date":"2025-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
