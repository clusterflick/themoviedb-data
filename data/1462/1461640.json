Director Carolina Campo Lupo and Eliana were friends since they were teenagers, they grew up together and always accompanied each other, learning how to become women, mothers, friends and political beings. One day Eliana falls ill and, not knowing what to do, Carolina gives her her film camera as a way of dealing with the uncertainty. From that day on, together they begin to film their last encounters. With the camera as a witness, free and shared between adults and children, they go through the small moments of life; the everyday becomes transcendent and love emerges as the only thing capable of sustaining us.","popularity":0.0876,"poster_path":"/rgHiCd9GkoPfjeqjzYC1y4sg5Br.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113561,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monarca
