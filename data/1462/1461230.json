She replaces her stepsister, who escapes from her own arranged marriage to Markus. On their wedding day, Ariel becomes deaf due to the emotional shock of Markus's indifferent remarks. Three years later, during a kidnapping incident, Ariel miraculously regains her hearing, only to overhear Markus coldly dismissing her plight as a hoax. Secretly, she maintains the guise of being deaf and, using a voice-altering device, poses as a kidnapper to demand a divorce from Markus... Can their love, long buried beneath layers of silence and misunderstanding, find its voice again?","popularity":0.6532,"poster_path":"/uqSxwneixXDGhFlTm7hACG65ZJo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":258810,"logo_path":null,"name":"24k
