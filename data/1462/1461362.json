I have reached out to her for the role, and while she appreciated my interest, she kindly declined, stating that she doesnâ€™t see a connection between her career in adult films and the topics of her travels.  Despite this, I am still passionate about bringing this unique narrative to life. I believe her story, intertwined with her travels in some of the most complex regions of the world, can provide a compelling and thought-provoking film. While this particular collaboration did not come to fruition, I remain committed to pursuing this project and believe that it holds significant artistic potential.","popularity":0.2377,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beyond the Screen: A Journey Through Borders and Boundaries.","title":"Untitled Muhammad Abed Baryal film (Whitney Wright)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1842045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Whitney Wright","original_name":"Whitney Wright","popularity":21.609,"profile_path":"/rrpgHJnZ1L3QWFlPSbrpJDXR3YZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Whitney","credit_id":"67f51857ddf9194387d9e428","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5352745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muhammad Abed Baryal","original_name":"Muhammad Abed Baryal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4FG0CJ5t4iL4UTDWr4DGy7VqaH8.jpg","credit_id":"67f51878240e659968992ce3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5352745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muhammad Abed Baryal","original_name":"Muhammad Abed Baryal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4FG0CJ5t4iL4UTDWr4DGy7VqaH8.jpg","credit_id":"67f5188f6c3583c97599787d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":209591,"name":"people"},{"id":215779,"name":"real story"},{"id":291864,"name":"world"},{"id":322942,"name":"adventure"},{"id":350003,"name":"whitney wright"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
