Since July 2022, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. – son of the former dictator – has governed the Philippines as its president, alongside Vice President Sara Duterte, daughter of Rodrigo Duterte. The collaboration between Kiri Dalena and Ben Brix incorporates aerial images to reveal the city’s dynamic activity from above, while ground-level shots follow individuals through various aspects of daily life and diverse social and urban spaces: They go to school, drive to work, attend cultural events or church services, paint protest posters, play music, or do domestic chores. Many scenes capture spontaneous moments, while others were reenacted with participants, blurring the lines between documentary and drama.  - Michaela Richter, Berlin","popularity":0.0811,"poster_path":"/l6CbsRN5zb4fMiAJ6m8wGpVKxFk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"STOP THE KILLINGS!","title":"Walang Masulingan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1208623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kiri Dalena","original_name":"Kiri Dalena","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/n1Sz78C0tg3tuwXfTNzWLGCvHw1.jpg","credit_id":"67f49ee0ddf9194387d9c03a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5356644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Brix","original_name":"Ben Brix","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f49ef18cfccf7bafd940ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l6CbsRN5zb4fMiAJ6m8wGpVKxFk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1r2tMli6hD9RhT4XrbY7iLZLKkK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1601,"name":"war on drugs"},{"id":213914,"name":"drug war"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
