Amongst those interviewed are Dawn O'Donnell (off camera at the beginning of the documentary) and psychiatrist Dr Neil McConaghy (the Australian 'expert' in aversion therapy). Some women are interviewed in shadow or close-up to disguise their identity. Women speak about being discriminated when applying for jobs against because of their sexuality. Dr Neil McConarghy is interviewed about his shock therapy work to change sexual orientation. Surprisingly Dr McConarghy says that homosexuality might be of benefit to society as creative traits or traits of non-conformity might give society as a whole the ability to survive.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cVLBjYLGPm6WsidnCKuS9CroWCm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Is Love: Lesbians","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1531913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dawn O'Donnell","original_name":"Dawn O'Donnell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67f6628acce7690230ace4e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5359449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil McConaghy","original_name":"Neil McConaghy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67f662947b43bdce20adcfa5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5359448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Westerway","original_name":"Peter Westerway","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6624cddf9194387da473e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Deveson","original_name":"Anne Deveson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f66267ddf9194387da4747","department":"Crew","job":"Presenter"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15150528","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":2173,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cVLBjYLGPm6WsidnCKuS9CroWCm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1546}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
