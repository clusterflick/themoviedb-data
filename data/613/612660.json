It documents the physical processes of his work and the distillation of visuals into sound, most notably addressing the appeal of abstraction—from the cheap effects of old monster movie makeup to the ‘masks’ created by the heavy cosmetic makeup of 1920s flapper culture and actresses like Pamela Stanford in Jess Franco’s Lorna the Exorcist (The Rita has albums or EPs named after several eurotrash actresses, including The Nylons of Laura Antonelli (2009) and Monica Swinn/Pamela Stanford (2016)).","popularity":0.2627,"poster_path":"/uTaNGJbYCg6e5eNPBkLdAK01TkK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tights Worship: Inside the Practices of The Rita","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam McKinlay","original_name":"Sam McKinlay","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5d1b746955b0c05c8269c8aa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2112884,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike McKinlay","original_name":"Mike McKinlay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1b747b55b0c05c8269c8ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2112884,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike McKinlay","original_name":"Mike McKinlay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1b74894dc34a000f9f614e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2112884,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike McKinlay","original_name":"Mike McKinlay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1b74934dc34a00119f630e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kier-La Janisse","original_name":"Kier-La Janisse","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/9PgFgRqwSFSRiwPE1N4kILoc9rd.jpg","credit_id":"5d1b74be4dc34a00119f6337","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2352836,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Faulkner","original_name":"George Faulkner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1b74da4dc34a00119f6366","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2352836,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Faulkner","original_name":"George Faulkner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1b750155b0c05dce69c509","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2352837,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christian Trineer","original_name":"Christian Trineer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1b75324dc34a00119f6415","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11778992","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uTaNGJbYCg6e5eNPBkLdAK01TkK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10551,"name":"ballet"},{"id":230875,"name":"nylons"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
