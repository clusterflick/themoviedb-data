Lingchi – Echoes of a Historical Photograph opens with the gruesome execution of a condemned man in extreme slow motion. The crowd of witnesses eagerly await to collect blood and pieces of skin. Chen interweaves the event with images of the ruins of the Summer Palace after the second Opium War (1860), and also with remnants of abandoned factories and suffering workers. While the recurrent appearance of the haunting black wounds on the condemned man’s chest connects history with the present, it is also a provocative yet cruel metaphor for the cultural and political hegemony from imperialism to the current global context. Chen’s film opens a dialogue with viewers on the ruthless and barbaric events that happen in contemporary society.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/oHSRHTo3Y4yOEqPQ2jmP8O5FxG9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lingchi: Echoes of a Historical Photograph","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Lingchi - Echoes of a Historical Photograph","type":"Alternate Punctuation"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chen Chieh-jen","original_name":"Chen Chieh-jen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1c7c7d55b0c05c826c82e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oHSRHTo3Y4yOEqPQ2jmP8O5FxG9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"《凌遲考》Lingchi: Echoes of a Historical Photograph (陳界仁 Chan Chieh-Jen, 2002)","key":"_CWM8tctvWY","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-12T07:26:49.000Z","id":"61bb0fc6223e20001d66a414"}]}}}
