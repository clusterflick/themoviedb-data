The film is like a fable, shot in the village of Cucunuba in the Andes. Cucunuba, like the world of García Márquez and Yoknapatawpha by Faulkner, is a mythical place that becomes universal despite and thanks to its special features. Cardosa: 'The theme of blindness is directly linked to the medium of film.
