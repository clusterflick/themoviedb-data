Through the flickering vignettes of a schoolboy trauma, visits to a friend at a psychiatric institution and encounters with animals, Ink in Milk exposes the anxious, web-like structures that underpin the tragicomedy of existence. The artist’s narrative is accompanied by a series of schematic, childlike diagrams, line drawings, ink paintings, plasticine animations, and crystalline sculptural forms, punctuated with super 8 film clips. Sometimes these images illustrate the narrative voice as gathered evidence; at other points they are oblique documents, disrupting chains of causality.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/k1RCosQqTi5dTlZroZaMtcaePH0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ink in Milk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2265858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gernot Wieland","original_name":"Gernot Wieland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1bc769532acb53a2cca11c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k1RCosQqTi5dTlZroZaMtcaePH0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
