In Sandra of the Tuliphouse or How to Live in Free State, Christiania is approached at face-value, as a self-described laboratory of freedom, an environment that provides an almost unparalleled opportunity to unravel a very particular history of markedly contrasting power relations and vivid social forces. Borrowing from the usually dispirit practices of cultural geography and fictional narrative  the project is constructed as a visual, spatial, and aural investigation of the site. The situation at Christiania in 2001 is compared with its distant past as a military base, its more recent utopian regeneration, and its possible future.","popularity":0.4281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sandra of the Tuliphouse or How to Live in a Free State","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2351033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Buckingham","original_name":"Matthew Buckingham","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/j58YJ7sQBkFwHMb2dDTo2TIELAW.jpg","credit_id":"5d1830ee90fca30016ac7cac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2351034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joachim Koester","original_name":"Joachim Koester","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d18310eca0e1711b06daf6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4970,"name":"autonomy"},{"id":158697,"name":"installation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
