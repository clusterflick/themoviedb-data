Our Love is a half-documentary, half-narrative telling the stories of Xiang Xiang, Ping Er and Raorao. Xiang Xiang is pretty and attractive, Ping Er smart and funny, Raorao honest and passionate. Physically speaking, they are male; but psychologically they are not. Issues such as homosexuality, transsexuality, and cross-dress are all touched upon in the film. Those who are different from heterosexual people are by no means perverts; their presence throws light on the ignored violence which has been taken for granted in the heterosexual world.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/1GqqDREXo2n8mIWvzE72gI5mDau.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A world where both sex exist in one person.","title":"Our Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5054159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Xiang","original_name":"Liu Xiang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Xiang Xiang","credit_id":"6732e252a7fdc8608788cadd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5054161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chen Li Qing","original_name":"Chen Li Qing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Teresa","credit_id":"6732e25bebc5a26e5e498fcb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5054165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chen Ping","original_name":"Chen Ping","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ping Er","credit_id":"6732e27eebc5a26e5e498fd9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5054166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tan Rao","original_name":"Tan Rao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rao Rao","credit_id":"6732e288ebc5a26e5e498fe5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5054167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhai Pei Ming","original_name":"Zhai Pei Ming","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"6732e2afa7fdc8608788cb04","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5054168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bi Xue Feng","original_name":"Bi Xue Feng","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Whoremonger","credit_id":"6732e2b8ebc5a26e5e498ff9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2353150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jiang Zhi","original_name":"Jiang Zhi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1c5e5255b0c00b7a6ab857","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5054169,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ge Fei","original_name":"Ge Fei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6732e2e74cee4fc8d5d1aad1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5054171,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ren Lan","original_name":"Ren Lan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6732e2f77ef2c31d78edd41d","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3058572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhao Gang","original_name":"Zhao Gang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6732e30b855cbb4e48f67358","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2353150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jiang Zhi","original_name":"Jiang Zhi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6732e32e4cee4fc8d5d1aafa","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2353150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jiang Zhi","original_name":"Jiang Zhi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6732e340c60448d677da3423","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14130174","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h3KNt4qjlFC0SbUgF3vwPh3LO3D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1546,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/1GqqDREXo2n8mIWvzE72gI5mDau.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.744,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/t8np60XF6GRK3g1PbsAq84XnUEl.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1054}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"China Independent Film Festival","release_date":"2006-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"UCCA Center for Contemporary Art","release_date":"2018-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
