Arseny Tarkovsky translated countless poems from Georgian, Arabic, Armenian, Kyrghyz, Polish etc., but many of his own poems were also translated into other languages. The maker of the documentary, Viatcheslav Amirchanian, cared for Arseny Tarkovsky in the last years of the poet's life, shot many hours of film in that period, took countless photographs and, years later, he combined this with other material to form this documentary. Tarkovsky Sr, who was admired by colleagues such as Joseph Brodsky, Anna Achmatova and Marina Cvetaeva, was never published during the Stalin era, even though he had lost a leg as a soldier at the front. His first book (Before the Snow) only appeared in 1962 during the thaw under Khrushchev.\" - IFFR","popularity":0.0314,"poster_path":"/dTRIkcxLcIpS6MPQTn8uOoIC4gp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156556,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atalanta Studio","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2004-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arseny Tarkovsky: Eternal Presence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2353458,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Arseny Tarkovsky","original_name":"Арсений Тарковский","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/2AsxBK9pa9TMkcVXrQtOr2qLYJ6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself (archive footage)","credit_id":"5d1cb9e5283ed9000e189696","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viacheslav Amirhanian","original_name":"Viacheslav Amirhanian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1cb97c55b0c01c356aacd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139039,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergey Yurizditskiy","original_name":"Sergey Yurizditskiy","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/NfY3RDSpDj7HHNqn6aFAQApNAl.jpg","credit_id":"5db975270792e100154745fc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0433671","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dTRIkcxLcIpS6MPQTn8uOoIC4gp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFFR","release_date":"2004-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
