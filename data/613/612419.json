In Queens she presides over a household comprised of a childish orphan who happens to be a cop, an elderly gentleman who explodes every time somebody calls him grandpa, a dying husband and an errant daughter who cries all night. The husband, Baba's fifth, is already submitting an ad for her sixth. The cop catches a Japanese stealing cameras and chains him to a radiator, the daughter guiltily confesses she voted for Nixon and runs off, and the husband-who may not die after all-insists they must wait out Watergate for a Democrat.","popularity":1.8078,"poster_path":"/lU4ykYxh07BcpKE1AGxdWBacp5o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20404,"logo_path":"/5qbeKB2Hq7ItbUQHrfTOUBQE9ta.png","name":"KCET","origin_country":"US"},{"id":15702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broadway
