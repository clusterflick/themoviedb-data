When Delatour is called away, Tolento inveigles Diane into attending a party at his house. There he threatens to ruin her husband if she does not submit to his demands within three months. Diane retaliates by showing him a letter proving that Tolento has only three months to live, according to a specialist. Delatour learns of his wife's presence at the party from one of the baron's women, and when Tolento makes Diane heir to his fortune, he becomes convinced of her infidelity.","popularity":0.2472,"poster_path":"/6IW1LNyjTQ7Rpn3TH4DsHJovn6m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3245,"logo_path":"/9dBTQp9XitrHkx20i1r9HhZ3Q6B.png","name":"First National Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A drama of Continental loves and jealousies- of a daring woman who sacrificed her conscience to love- sold her soul and body to Passion.
