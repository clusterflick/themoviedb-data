Following Standhope's death, Laura and her sweetheart, Jim Watson, read in her deceased mother's diary that Andrew had broken up the Standhopes' marriage soon after the twins' birth by unjustly accusing Mrs. Standhope of infidelity. Laura was then sent to boarding school, while little Larry, placed in his father's care, was neglected and later became a thief. As Laura and Jim ponder Larry's whereabouts, the house is robbed by none other than Larry, now called \"the Kid,\" and his cohort, \"the Snail.\"","popularity":0.0674,"poster_path":"/dXCRHUdaXUWKJGpGUoDB0bBMUbz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":88999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bluebird Photoplays","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Together","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violet Mersereau","original_name":"Violet Mersereau","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/q9mh4kaKAmn5nJpBycbLXZXar2z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mrs. Richard Standhope / Laura Stanhope / Larry, the 'Kid'","credit_id":"5d2e97db6a300b0010a65f3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chester Barnett","original_name":"Chester Barnett","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/f6CA6jOrhcddwfhIwIqM6u6xioB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jim Watson","credit_id":"5d2e97e06a300b2246a2c62f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Randall","original_name":"Bernard Randall","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Andrew Brean","credit_id":"5d2e97facaab6d31b29a7185","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2363537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lindsay J.
