Upon arriving on the island, Marama learns that she is a half-caste. Traumatized, she assumes native customs and agrees to marry Ratu Madri, the island's ruler. Templeton, an American fugitive living on Fiji, falls in love with her, but Marama rejects him, having pledged herself already to the Fiji chief. As Marama dances the prenuptial rite, Templeton attempts to rescue her. The natives seize the American, and Marama threatens suicide if they harm him. The couple escape during a hurricane, and soon after a yacht arrives with the news that Templeton has been exonerated of murder charges. Their problems thus resolved, they return to America to wed. A lost film.","popularity":0.4661,"poster_path":"/yw9zUuqiC1seJUJXIMgSnI3NGMO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adorable Savage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Uvejrsnatten i Sydhavet","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Marama - SÃ¶derhavsflickan","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Marama","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Roberts","original_name":"Edith Roberts","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/gDYOXTWW1WUYsMV7wsaKJBlESYd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marama Thurston","credit_id":"5d1a8ee930aa3138d6c5ffb4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1014834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Perrin","original_name":"Jack Perrin","popularity":0.1709,"profile_path":"/iHon1YovaxeKZrLM7ouj1B4k1ng.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Templeton","credit_id":"5d1a8ef3ca4f6752bcd75442","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Cummings","original_name":"Richard Cummings","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jim Thurston (as Dick Cummings)","credit_id":"5d1a8f0230aa317eccc5f64b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noble Johnson","original_name":"Noble Johnson","popularity":0.6984,"profile_path":"/ktN2dIxPBTdt7RqpFoWD0upCbUp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ratu Madri","credit_id":"5d1a8f0830aa3138d6c5ffdd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2352433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Jervis","original_name":"Arthur Jervis","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Frank Maddon (as Dr. Arthur Jervis)","credit_id":"5d1a8f16ca4f6744dad69874","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3310634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille Moulton","original_name":"Lucille Moulton","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Moala","credit_id":"6192849d03bf840029a92001","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3112214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Phillips","original_name":"Lily Phillips","popularity":0.2775,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Akanesi","credit_id":"619284aaf85958002b74706c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2467608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga D.
