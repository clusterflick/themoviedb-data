Heidi's natural cheerfulness quickly brings renewed joy in grandfather Alps life. Heidi becomes friends with the goatherd Peter who is about the same age as her and spent two beautiful years in the pasture. But then she is sent by her aunt to Frankfurt in the house of Consul Sesemann where Heidi should get a proper education and upbringing. After some initial difficulties Heidi eventually adjusts to her new situation and makes friends with Clara, the paralyzed daughter of the consul. Only with the strict governess Miss Rottingmeier she keeps getting in trouble. Miss Rottingmeier clearly can not cope with the free and outdoors spirit of Heidi. But Heidi lets a fresh wind blow through the Sesemann house and even causes Clara to overcome her illness.","popularity":0.388,"poster_path":"/f078ylpJ7UuXFfBpVIZuXIzeHbV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heidi","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1003984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Maria Singhammer ","original_name":"Eva Maria Singhammer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"Heidi","credit_id":"52fe49729251416c750c8457","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustav Knuth","original_name":"Gustav Knuth","popularity":0.2089,"profile_path":"/kH8X0KGlUrBUQjtU2qdRziLxLKs.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Alp Oehi","credit_id":"52fe49729251416c750c845b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michaela May","original_name":"Michaela May","popularity":0.1835,"profile_path":"/dFCn6vA0eNQ8b5y3fceS1k4gsnm.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Klara Sesemann","credit_id":"52fe49729251416c750c845f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1003985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Koester","original_name":"Jan Koester","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":"/h5KQjn15h7HhwLpNUJJx4d69AY7.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Geissen-Peter","credit_id":"52fe49729251416c750c8463","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margot Trooger","original_name":"Margot Trooger","popularity":0.3314,"profile_path":"/3lDoLExToWTBzTUImJkOTh0wzVZ.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Fräulein Rottenmeier","credit_id":"52fe49729251416c750c8467","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Vogel","original_name":"Rudolf Vogel","popularity":0.2128,"profile_path":"/7C5ArHHfYi5n1JiEtAOgFqLH2AP.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Butler Sebastian","credit_id":"57b6192d9251417c21004b2f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotte Ledl","original_name":"Lotte Ledl","popularity":0.1587,"profile_path":"/9S7R1sOzGloZlHDXxdTCOinkQGQ.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"Tante Dete","credit_id":"57b619569251411c38000a2e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarete Haagen","original_name":"Margarete Haagen","popularity":0.2028,"profile_path":"/vTjwPXwDxEtB1zFHKTnT5cTEHZF.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Großmama Sesemann","credit_id":"57b61969c3a36820f400092b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Schröder","original_name":"Ernst Schröder","popularity":0.1339,"profile_path":"/jdlJIKBZfHzSFA7MWMQojnuVh0x.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"Konsul Alfred Sesemann","credit_id":"57b619799251411c6d000953","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Prack","original_name":"Rudolf Prack","popularity":0.2939,"profile_path":"/WwUXaHCgrhcrbumn45FGT4Jwpu.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"Pfarrer","credit_id":"57b619909251417c21004b7b","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38048,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Jacobs","original_name":"Werner Jacobs","popularity":0.1855,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49729251416c750c846d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0059259","wikidata_id":"Q1594287","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/f078ylpJ7UuXFfBpVIZuXIzeHbV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ctoLdMLHoB6lcgK03VM2ivpAFbH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1337,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/wnabfqq7gWJTIWc4V6s2nbzxsF5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":891}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
