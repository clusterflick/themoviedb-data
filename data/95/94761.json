The zeitgeist exhibited at these conventions was not lost on the band and in 1996 they responded, rising up like a grease painted phoenix into a new era of success. On the surface, KISS fans got exactly what they longed for, but for some the return of their idols brought unexpected consequences. KISS Loves You follows a few KISS fans along the way.","popularity":0.843,"poster_path":"/1uzJEDZzC6FfdVyJStx0Ivwqpyt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KISS Loves You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Criss","original_name":"Peter Criss","popularity":0.1303,"profile_path":"/ysguTrAUiRrcRLteVNhdbSH0oMF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49689251416c750c70fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Simmons","original_name":"Gene Simmons","popularity":0.3152,"profile_path":"/c1t3QgTO4XTDZZG5Ndjxjt8Jt0a.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49689251416c750c70ff","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Henaghan","original_name":"Jim Henaghan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49689251416c750c70f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1102243","wikidata_id":"Q6416957","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ecepSXBI3KIbB25yGgx4mbOy9ie.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1uzJEDZzC6FfdVyJStx0Ivwqpyt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9818,"name":"fan culture"},{"id":15201,"name":"music fan"},{"id":208663,"name":"fan convention"},{"id":220266,"name":"fandom"},{"id":220267,"name":"tribute band"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
