During the trials, the brakes go on George's bike, 'The Shuttleworth Snap', which he made himself. As a result, he breaks the TT lap record, becoming an instant motor-cycling star. As the big race approaches, George soon realises that other jealous riders will stop at nothing to make sure he does not take part in the race. An early George Formby film and probably his best.","popularity":0.3146,"poster_path":"/5cWDPEOxgWMaCgxP8XofX7H7bdh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Associated Talking
