Right in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, Corvo is a large rock, 6km high and 4km long, with the crater of a volcano and a single tiny village of 440 people. Gradually, this small filming crew is accepted by the island’s population as its new inhabitants, two people to add to a civilization almost 500 years old, whose history is hardly discernible, such is the lack of records and written memories. Shot at a vertiginous pace throughout a few years, self‐produced between arrivals, departures and coming‐backs, “It’s the Earth not the Moon” develops as the logbook of a ship, and turns out as a patchwork of discoveries and experiences, which follow the contemporary life of a civilization isolated in the middle of the sea. A long atlantic film‐odissey, divided in 14 chapters, that combines anthropological records, literature, lost archives, mythological and autobiographical stories.","popularity":0.1029,"poster_path":"/m0WdMsnkk4Hs2nNr1DWh9l8Mg6V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126238,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gonçalo Tocha","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2012-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":193,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's the Earth Not the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2092646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dídio Pestana","original_name":"Dídio Pestana","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5dec26d4158c85001580c9ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gonçalo Tocha","original_name":"Gonçalo Tocha","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5dec26e0158c85001580c9f5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gonçalo Tocha","original_name":"Gonçalo Tocha","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49629251416c750c6415","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2331173","wikidata_id":"Q2605889","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1675,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/m0WdMsnkk4Hs2nNr1DWh9l8Mg6V.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1117},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/n0tbjhxgDbnGo6dvRzs4hGHAYPG.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2011-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
