I am facing the S. Miguel island sea, the family land in the Azores. Between the newborn babies, I found my Grandaunt, 91 years old, waiting for her moment to part. At night my family speaks to me of God and death. During the day we swim in the island's volcanic sea, where I meet Florence and Beru, a French couple that is crossing the Atlantic in the Balaou, a sailing boat. They invite me to come with them.\" Divided in three moments and eight lessons, Balaou is a voyage to accept the oblivion of things.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/nLMsdQJ4tT6Z4XGYNFzYaIZOnLc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Balaou","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1002584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Beaufrère","original_name":"Florence Beaufrère","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe49629251416c750c6459","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1002585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Ilda Cardoso","original_name":"Maria Ilda Cardoso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe49629251416c750c645d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1002586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria do Rosario Gouveia Filipe","original_name":"Maria do Rosario Gouveia Filipe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe49629251416c750c6461","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1002587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert Gidon","original_name":"Hubert Gidon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe49629251416c750c6465","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gonçalo Tocha","original_name":"Gonçalo Tocha","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe49629251416c750c6469","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1002588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yumi","original_name":"Yumi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe49629251416c750c646d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gonçalo Tocha","original_name":"Gonçalo Tocha","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49629251416c750c6455","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gonçalo Tocha","original_name":"Gonçalo Tocha","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49629251416c750c644f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2091862","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/nLMsdQJ4tT6Z4XGYNFzYaIZOnLc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
