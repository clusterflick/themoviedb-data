According to the guidelines, the data were immediately isolated and sent to be re-evaluated in order to classify the registered events and to develop further options for protective and preventive efforts. A few days later, the tranquility of the sleeping \"Xonasu\" was torn apart by sharp, blazing fragments of multiple meteors. The area around the \"Xonasu\" faltered - a wave of interruptions and failures rapidly swept through the heart of its systems ... and one of the errors launched the sequence to awake the Supreme Operator of Xonasu. A little later - all was quiet and still.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/wReCMn22d2vuKur5zq0vN0ySsVq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exaella","video":false,"vote_average":4.643,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1001623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yamamoto Akari","original_name":"Yamamoto Akari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Exaella / Piku (voice)","credit_id":"52fe494e9251416c750c3c7d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1001624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oki Mikito","original_name":"Oki Mikito","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ken / Clouds / Pilot (voice)","credit_id":"52fe494e9251416c750c3c81","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1001079,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Oudot","original_name":"Andrew Oudot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494e9251416c750c3c6d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1001079,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Oudot","original_name":"Andrew Oudot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494e9251416c750c3c61","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1001079,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Oudot","original_name":"Andrew Oudot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494e9251416c750c3c73","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1001079,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Oudot","original_name":"Andrew Oudot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494e9251416c750c3c67","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1001622,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Isakawa Denisu","original_name":"Isakawa Denisu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe494e9251416c750c3c79","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1001079,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Oudot","original_name":"Andrew Oudot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668c681831e7a10f61b2bf5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2160163","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fw9jWyNWOB1EWth7wU0XHkdcsKU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wReCMn22d2vuKur5zq0vN0ySsVq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Exaella OVA | Anime Trailer","key":"14wyTrz23io","published_at":"2012-01-11T06:51:53.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6d8c3a3685448007f28"}]}}}
