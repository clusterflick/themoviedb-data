It was a titanic battle between two of the sport's true greats, Michael Schumacher - in his final F1 season - and Fernando Alonso. Eventually the drivers' championship was decided at the very end of a gripping season.  Three \"new\" teams appeared on the grid in 2006 - Scuderia Toro Rosso (formerly Minardi), Midland F1 (formerly Jordan) and BMW Sauber (formerly Sauber BMW). Super Aguri Honda were a genuinely new team who just barely made it to the first grand prix.  Rule changes included engine limitations (2.4 litre and 8 cylinders), a new qualifying format and the return of tyre changes.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/opqxpvJPOE8iOcStC4vWCj790WU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Once Again!","title":"2006 FIA Formula One World Championship Season Review","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/opqxpvJPOE8iOcStC4vWCj790WU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
