The moment is interrupted by the man and his thoughts â€“ he has to go in order to earn money. They spend autumn and winter separately - she yearns alone, he works hard in a mine and a forge. In spring, when the woman runs towards the man in order to welcome him, she sees a dead man walking. She manages to recognize him only by the pendant that she gave him. In her embrace, the man regains his strength. Gold coins fall to the ground and merge with golden rod, the Polish mimosa.  Stylistic paintings refer to oil painting and hold the subsequent phases of the figure's movement, which gives the impression of plane movement.","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":"/fKsbI1OJOP73oXu2pYE71a7NYR7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Miniatur Filmowych","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1973-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mimosa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836042,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrzej Lach","original_name":"Andrzej Lach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650ca2a3f9253200ea9153c2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836042,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrzej Lach","original_name":"Andrzej Lach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650ca2b244ea54013b7f328a","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209914,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jan Tkaczyk","original_name":"Jan Tkaczyk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650ca2be2c6b7b00c4fe1065","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2615834,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacek Ostaszewski","original_name":"Jacek Ostaszewski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650ca2c9f9253200ade0afbb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3363862,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Magdalena Barycz","original_name":"Magdalena Barycz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650ca2d73d745400feed5975","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piotr Szpakowicz","original_name":"Piotr Szpakowicz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b761c4e263bb0061d16225","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xbguhKv37rReCiqw5BFbKNDiwwV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fKsbI1OJOP73oXu2pYE71a7NYR7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gKywSbj4Zit0HMhSV73DvPITdn3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xPo92gCbpDirXmC1Y0Cx6mAc9Gy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
