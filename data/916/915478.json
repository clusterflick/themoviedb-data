Spring is in full swing, but this far north winter is never far away and, with hungry bears and wolves for neighbours, many challenges lie ahead. Local cameraman Hugo Kitching knows this only too well, but he is determined to follow the mother and calf through the four seasons. What unfolds is a very intimate story, and when Hugo finds a second moose calf born late in the year, things take an unexpected and dramatic turn.","popularity":0.4586,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meet the Moose Family","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Kitching","original_name":"Hugo Kitching","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61b75c62d1444300413a6c8a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1245549,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Fleming","original_name":"Susan Fleming","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b75c7fcb75d10096f5c86d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1441173,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Siobhan Flanagan","original_name":"Siobhan Flanagan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b75c99fd7aa400404ab753","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6236792","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
