The film is simply a series of shots of people and their surroundings. Some of the shots are synchronous sound, some are non-synchronous sound, some are silent and some are just sound without picture. My experience is that synchronous sound situations create a mental reality or presence which is greater than the sum of its parts. In other words, the synchronous combination of picture and sound forms a spatial reality which is uniquely present. Presence of Mind deals with variations of this spatial presence created by sync sound film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Presence of Mind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
