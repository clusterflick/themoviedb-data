One take, a little over 7 minutes in length is a black wooden chair slowly being rained upon by large multi-colored feathers. There is no sound. The piece is Zen like and meditative transporting the viewer into contentment as feathers gather on and around the chair.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/uTtRqpU5XeJWzUDtYpN923co6c8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chair","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Goldstein","original_name":"Jack Goldstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b7db397d5f4b004290d033","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uTtRqpU5XeJWzUDtYpN923co6c8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
