This program introduces the life, vocabulary and concepts of Lev Vygotsky. The video illustrates four basic concepts integral to his work: Children construct knowledge, learning can lead development, development cannot be separated from its social context, and language plays a central role in cognitive development. Elena Bodrova brings an easy familiarity to these concepts. Deborah Leongâ€™s commentary and the lively classroom examples enable students, teachers in training, and classroom teachers to incorporate these concepts into their understanding of child development.","popularity":2.2447,"poster_path":"/tbHxkf3EhNuC0SYRGU25jTCPfSz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Davidson Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vygotsky's Developmental Theory: An Introduction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3347770,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elena Bodrova","original_name":"Elena Bodrova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61b915580443c9004109a26d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3347771,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Deborah J.
