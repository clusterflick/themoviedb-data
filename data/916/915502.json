Here hyenas aren't just scavengers, they're also skilled hunters when they work together in the clan. But life is still a struggle, and except for the few weeks a year when the wildebeest pass through, there isn't enough food to go around. Lions are their mortal enemies - they are quick to attack hyenas and often scavenge their kills. After Naabi's mother is killed by lions, life becomes even more difficult for the young hyena and she's forced to leave the clan, braving the perils of the outside world as she travels alone in search of food.","popularity":0.1993,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naabi: A Hyena Princess","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aicha Kossoko","original_name":"Aicha Kossoko","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61b76a1085005d00413bc0a0","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2496730","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
