Past and present in current experiences. Documentary about the Iny people, who live in the village of Santa Isabel do Morro, on Bananal Island, Tocantins. Meanings and tensions between the recovery of the original traditions of leaders and elders and the incorporation of white culture by indigenous youth. Processes of experiences and memories: dismay and resistance in facing the Iny identity. Delicate record of different imagery views in the intertwining between indigenous filmmaker and the film's director.","popularity":0.1053,"poster_path":"/5VbMEbvMiFLq0dzIqsn5oo8S4N4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De Onde Viemos, Para Onde Vamos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3346249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rochane Torres","original_name":"Rochane Torres","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pTBvtC1DW8kjaQYmDNCs6IeBY0r.jpg","credit_id":"61b73b85fd7aa400404a943a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1367806,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paulo Gonçalves","original_name":"Paulo Gonçalves","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d1e2de7b7b4d0069c6680b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902321,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paulo Rezende","original_name":"Paulo Rezende","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d1e2a31684f7008dcb5291","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3367274,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juanahu Karajá","original_name":"Juanahu Karajá","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d1e2cdc15f890040f24599","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1367806,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paulo Gonçalves","original_name":"Paulo Gonçalves","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d1e2b6f1b57100689568e5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3346249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rochane Torres","original_name":"Rochane Torres","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pTBvtC1DW8kjaQYmDNCs6IeBY0r.jpg","credit_id":"61d1e263aaec71001cb23372","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3346249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rochane Torres","original_name":"Rochane Torres","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pTBvtC1DW8kjaQYmDNCs6IeBY0r.jpg","credit_id":"61d1e26ee210230091695248","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3367269,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juliana de Castro","original_name":"Juliana de Castro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d1e28a944a570091e04826","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":757,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5VbMEbvMiFLq0dzIqsn5oo8S4N4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":509}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"54º Festival de Brasília do Cinema Brasileiro","release_date":"2021-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"De Onde Viemos, Para Onde Vamos - Trailer","key":"ZTOTvFkvjEA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-11-17T15:45:14.000Z","id":"61d1e35522f5d7001f983cb0"}]}}}
