Hours earlier, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic. What seems to be the safest place in the world, becomes the worst nightmare of those who travel on the cruise when the first positive case is detected on board. Upon verifying the massive contagion inside the ship, all the countries refuse to receive it, except Uruguay. The country that had implemented an operation to repatriate thousands of citizens and resident migrants, was the only one that provided humanitarian aid to the Greg Mortimer cruise ship that, at the time of docking in the port of Montevideo, was collapsed by illness and anguish. A story where empathy, solidarity and organized action were key to containing the impacts of the disaster.","popularity":0.1139,"poster_path":"/zgIBudaFFTgYWpRupOZ8cB442PQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2021-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greg
