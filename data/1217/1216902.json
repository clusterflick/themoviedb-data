Arnie touched the lives of musicians young and old, Israeli and American, Jew and Arab.  The director met Arnie, a sickly, neglected man who walked the streets of Jerusalem. Arnie spoke of his days of glory- performances with the greatest of his generation, from Dizzy Gillespie to Sonny Rollins, performances on prime-time television with Stan Getz and other icons and opening the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music in New York.  Only after his death and curious about the truth behind Arnie’s stories, the director uncovers the story of this outstanding musician. This film follows the last days of iconic American jazz musician Arnie Lawrence, who fell from fame to homelessness in Israel where he created a bridge between people through music. His legacy is the generation of world-famous Israeli jazz musicians he inspired and who appear in the film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/j3PHHG8omKuVvgkb53Sl0NAj3WI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Hear a Rainbow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4426272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eli Tal-El","original_name":"Eli Tal-El","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65788675bbe1dd00e15ef147","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nubGiYcgdxkFErBYXZNfj6gkA3R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j3PHHG8omKuVvgkb53Sl0NAj3WI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
