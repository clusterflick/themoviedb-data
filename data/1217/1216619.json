Monk Beopjeong of ‘no possessions’. KBS reporters met him, who had long avoided TV appearances and contact with the media. One day, about 6 months later, after lingering around the camera without even turning it on, the monk said his first words. ‘Let’s support the cows’. The meeting that took place after that and the monk's words were captured on screen. The clear and fragrant words of a monk heard among the bamboo forest along with the beautiful four seasons of Bulilam Hermitage! An anti-war message delivered by a monk at Ground Zero in the United States. 'Hate only blinds the eyes.' The footage of him accompanying Monk Beopjeong for three years will be revealed on a KBS Sunday special.","popularity":0.145,"poster_path":"/yCn487Lc0ODnxpDj35ZmkmLAYa7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154810,"logo_path":"/ptFmUmvS7aANRcmajNW249FGPMu.png","name":"KBS","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2003-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monk Beopjeong, Meet Him in The Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3600403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Jaechul","original_name":"Park Jaechul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65786de87a3c5200ca7a1fe6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3557282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Se-won","original_name":"Kim Se-won","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6577acbabbe1dd00ac7d4213","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seo Yong-ha","original_name":"Seo Yong-ha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577ac75ec8a43011a3a358a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425418,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cho Dae-hyun","original_name":"Cho Dae-hyun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577ad17bbe1dd00e15eb10f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425419,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jo In-seok","original_name":"Jo In-seok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577ad2ee93e95218dcbdcf0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l7tGFD7e6Kuxhl2PKDPscrkcS42.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yCn487Lc0ODnxpDj35ZmkmLAYa7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18256,"name":"spiritual"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"#법정, 산에서 그를 만나다  / 일요스페셜  [추억의 영상]  KBS 방송(2003.4.13)","key":"G1O3o-GjDaw","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-25T10:30:02.000Z","id":"6577af2eec8a430137ff91ef"}]}}}
