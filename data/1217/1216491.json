It tells the story of a global team united, not only in trying to make Sarahâ€™s 40-mile challenge a success, but also in using it to raise awareness about the issue of plastic pollution. Without being able to touch a boat or another person, her daunting swim was estimated to take up to 32 hours to complete, through strong currents, large waves, powerful winds and other hurdles along the way. Against the Current is now screening at film festivals.","popularity":0.7847,"poster_path":"/gdznp6Sidw5hrgiLJAHAbxscpdy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199293,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plastic Oceans International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One Woman's World-Record Swim Around Easter Island to Help Change the World","title":"Against the Current","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Modine","original_name":"Matthew Modine","popularity":1.9796,"profile_path":"/z974QEHL12qUvLyk6hlWGAmDgom.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"657750cf7a3c5200ebfdf7f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Ferguson","original_name":"Sarah Ferguson","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"657750da9451e70ff39a236c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Houston","original_name":"Sarah Houston","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"657751f7af58cb00aea573b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John McCarthy","original_name":"John McCarthy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"657752354bfa540138802afc","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363704,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacob Tardien","original_name":"Jacob Tardien","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657752b17a3c52014e6a2f1b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Modine","original_name":"Matthew Modine","popularity":1.9796,"profile_path":"/z974QEHL12qUvLyk6hlWGAmDgom.jpg","credit_id":"6577552d5b950800c65b98ae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tod Hardin","original_name":"Tod Hardin","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577526e20ecaf013acb2515","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587375,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Rackoff","original_name":"Adam Rackoff","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577527ee93e95218f6b9de7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638583,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William Pfeiffer","original_name":"William Pfeiffer","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657752a4a1d33200c4c78f56","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424869,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Erik Aleynikov","original_name":"Erik Aleynikov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657752beec8a43011a3a1315","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424871,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Brandon Sugiyama","original_name":"Brandon Sugiyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657752f4af58cb01236c0b81","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424873,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Minneboo","original_name":"Mark Minneboo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657753085b9508013db458a9","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tod Hardin","original_name":"Tod Hardin","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657755384bfa5400c409ebe2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424869,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Erik Aleynikov","original_name":"Erik Aleynikov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657752c9ec8a430137ff6fee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14153114","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/whpLuuD73HJxvRexHSB6Rea8oMB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gdznp6Sidw5hrgiLJAHAbxscpdy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15058,"name":"swimming"},{"id":163212,"name":"water pollution"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
