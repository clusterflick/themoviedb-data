We live in a very cold place. We know how to survive. We don’t make money, we live from the land. Until now”.  Over 18 days photographers Marta Bretó and Tato Rosés explore the world of the Gwit’chin, also called the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (Alaska), one of the most pristine and wild areas on Earth.
