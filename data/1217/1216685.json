It was even better getting to show my Wife’s family this place we’ve grown to love so much over the past 5 years. “Gusts From The Highlands” is my 3rd travel piece I’ve had the pleasure of creating there. Bringing along the Leica Q2 was a great addition in the toolkit for shooting the photos you see in this piece. It was fun experimenting with the Sirui anamorphic’s as well. Thanks to my love Christie LaPlant for all the killer drone shots!","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iceland // Gusts From The Highlands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3156702,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Cody Laplant","original_name":"Cody Laplant","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577f2f84bfa5400c40a2aa0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
