When the performers on stage noticed his jumps and the way of dancing specific to hardcore music and inquired about the most loyal member of their audience, they learned an incredible story. In order to attend the concert, VaXz travels from Bosilegrad to Belgrade sometimes up to ten hours, and then returns, sometimes immediately after listening to the gig. In this film, we meet Vladan and what it is that inspires him about hardcore, but through his portrait we also get to know life in a small town like Bosilegrad, as well as the history of hardcore music in Serbia and how bands came together to honor their most loyal fan.","popularity":0.0692,"poster_path":"/dovUWKZFxKwMNLAXmSvwG3AJyfc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142139,"logo_path":null,"name":"VICE Srbija","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Man Makes the Difference","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"One Man Changes All","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladan Vasev","original_name":"Vladan Vasev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6577a951a1d3320138eafb02","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3384136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petar Petrović","original_name":"Petar Petrović","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577a997ec8a43011a3a320c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628223,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Žolt Virag","original_name":"Žolt Virag","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577a9c889d97f013ac990db","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275262,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Goran Kovačević","original_name":"Goran Kovačević","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577a9f4ec8a430137ff8c6e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425410,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Željko Palošek","original_name":"Željko Palošek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577a9bf35a61e00c63454e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3384136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petar Petrović","original_name":"Petar Petrović","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577a9a49451e70fed0755a2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668539,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Maja Radošević","original_name":"Maja Radošević","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577a9e5af58cb01236c261b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425411,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ivan Grujić","original_name":"Ivan Grujić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577a9d97a3c52010cdea1bb","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4425413,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Saša Potežica","original_name":"Saša Potežica","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577aa0be93e95218f6bbb49","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3947468,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Miloš Korać","original_name":"Miloš Korać","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577a9af89d97f00c678cb3e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dovUWKZFxKwMNLAXmSvwG3AJyfc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
