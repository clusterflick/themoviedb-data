In the style of a mockumentary, von Rebenstiel is also accompanied outside of the interview. In an ironic way, the short film attempts to break up the fiction described by Friedrich with shots from reality and at the same time show the problematic relationship between role and private person. In doing so, the initially clear boundary becomes increasingly blurred and ultimately erases the private person completely.","popularity":0.0999,"poster_path":"/2UEvcbhU8r2a5hnxCT9BuYagJ5Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Die Kleinbürger","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A humorous yet critical mockumentary that examines the problematic relationship between the actor's public role and his private life.","title":"The Relapse into Decadence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Schlicht","original_name":"Andreas Schlicht","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Friedrich von Rebenstiel","credit_id":"65771b8cec8a43011a3a0125","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stina Jähngen","original_name":"Stina Jähngen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Interviewpartnerin","credit_id":"65771bc6564ec700acd4ccd3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Brunner","original_name":"Zoe Brunner","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Statist","credit_id":"65771bd3bbe1dd0138d01d3f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Annus","original_name":"Benjamin Annus","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Statist","credit_id":"65771bdda1d33200febd7e21","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4424414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Mesina","original_name":"Federico Mesina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/z6gb02J5YVOmem0waWuA5YOF0qF.jpg","credit_id":"65771bedc6006d011f0e2cb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4424414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Mesina","original_name":"Federico Mesina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/z6gb02J5YVOmem0waWuA5YOF0qF.jpg","credit_id":"65771bf9ec8a4300aa6c7001","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Annus","original_name":"Benjamin Annus","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65771c24bbe1dd00fe2bed16","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424419,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maximilian Wulf","original_name":"Maximilian Wulf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65771c569451e70fec7fe874","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Annus","original_name":"Benjamin Annus","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65771c6e89d97f00aefc06fa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424482,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Hlawatschek","original_name":"Martin Hlawatschek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65771c84a1d33200acb94390","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510942,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Miguel Hernández","original_name":"Miguel Hernández","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65771cdb7a3c5200ad19265a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730280,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Miguel Hernández","original_name":"Miguel Hernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65771d07ec8a4300fd7db66c","department":"Production","job":"Post Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424493,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tim Fleskes","original_name":"Tim Fleskes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65771d4920ecaf011db5b195","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6o4gDBoZpnZnOQOZ06d37EeDPSG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2UEvcbhU8r2a5hnxCT9BuYagJ5Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":322268,"name":"comedy"},{"id":326051,"name":"filmz"},{"id":326052,"name":"kleinbürger"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
