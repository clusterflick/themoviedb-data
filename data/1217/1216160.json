That is a growing awareness that the film medium has a formal as well as a representational aspect. That it can best communicate vision and realty when it organically exploits its own plastic means and mode of composition. And that for a film to move people deeply, the filmmaker needs not only a special way of seeing experience, but a specific way of filming it.\r This film tells the story of a man who has a rendezvous with memory and desire; a man who can neither escape from his present nor his past. Moving on two levels–the objective and subjective–the film shifts back and forth from vision to reality: from memory to desire; from the prison of obsessions to the metaphors of regression.\"–L.J.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Time: Another Voice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1373993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lewis Jacobs","original_name":"Lewis Jacobs","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6576376fa84a472de4077b43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
