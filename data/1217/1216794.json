Previously available as individual titles in VHS and Laserdisc formats, Strange (1988) and Strange Too (1990) are compilations of the provocative and visionary short films lensed by master photographer/director Anton Corbijn, in collaboration with Depeche Mode, to create a new visual iconography for the band and their music.  When assembling the final edits for Strange and Strange Too, Corbijn created a visual running order where the individual music videos are perceived as one continuous film, with additional interstitial content not seen in the original clips.","popularity":0.4261,"poster_path":"/4E8oMxZeoiBYYYr75yRuSMeOJgb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Depeche Mode - Strange & Strange Too","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Gahan","original_name":"Dave Gahan","popularity":0.3398,"profile_path":"/lrZ4xbCYPeOXSCF15rh97ZTSVIy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"657838ea2dc9dc0122f1d7d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Gore","original_name":"Martin Gore","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/vmvqq1oVJv1O48xLRTQN6IZFDJ0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"657838f2ec8a4300fd7e276f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy 'Fletch' Fletcher","original_name":"Andy 'Fletch' Fletcher","popularity":0.1633,"profile_path":"/nCFC1e1Tigplu6NF6lg2zXvC8IX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65783904a1d33200acb9b2b1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Wilder","original_name":"Alan Wilder","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":"/tMBH0qmHHlS7i2gV7GTP27IFJjU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65783914564ec700feb5ab23","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anton Corbijn","original_name":"Anton Corbijn","popularity":0.3159,"profile_path":"/tBr98AlA0vYHX1s2faMeatfab5O.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Director","credit_id":"657839b4a1d33200e1b87600","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1psRQ4hvXTvTU0ocXx26lk6NSaI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4E8oMxZeoiBYYYr75yRuSMeOJgb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1073}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
