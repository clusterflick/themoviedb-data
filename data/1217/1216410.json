The working-class families live in poor conditions and can barely feed their many children. Maerker therefore wants to give a lecture on contraception in the inn, but encounters fierce resistance from his conservative boss, Dr. Witte, who wants to prevent the lecture together with the pastor and the magistrate. Only a severe nervous fever finally persuades old Witte to side with Maerker.","popularity":0.1099,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":215756,"logo_path":null,"name":"Verlag wissenschaftlicher Filme","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1930-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fruchtbarkeit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Henckels","original_name":"Paul Henckels","popularity":0.2057,"profile_path":"/lOB0gXEAfTF5HO3Iu27OHKGLDhA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dr. Paul Märker","credit_id":"65771242a1d33200e1b80dcb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Barby","original_name":"Edward Barby","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Friedrich Witte","credit_id":"657712804bfa5401388018a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeria Blanka","original_name":"Valeria Blanka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Elinor","credit_id":"65771290a1d33200c4c779f4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4424417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anny Eberty","original_name":"Anny Eberty","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Maria Huber","credit_id":"6577129dbbe1dd00c40ce7b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2784387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanna Hoessrich","original_name":"Hanna Hoessrich","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Marianne","credit_id":"657712aabbe1dd00fe2bea63","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2390777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Oberländer","original_name":"Hans Oberländer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Priest","credit_id":"657712b64bfa5400abef47f1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Steinbeck","original_name":"Walter Steinbeck","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/zZHSgfweHKsQ8b03mZZTDAB2Rd1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Principal Roeder","credit_id":"657712c0c6006d011f0e29bc","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448012,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eberhard Frowein","original_name":"Eberhard Frowein","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657712d2a1d332011b4f7805","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1309220,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Lehmann","original_name":"Walter Lehmann","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657713c1ec8a4300aa6c6d8a","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534757,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kurt Kahle","original_name":"Kurt Kahle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577138520ecaf0100d219fb","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534757,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kurt Kahle","original_name":"Kurt Kahle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577138ae93e95218f6b8bb0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448012,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eberhard Frowein","original_name":"Eberhard Frowein","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657712cdec8a43011a39fe3f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534757,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kurt Kahle","original_name":"Kurt Kahle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577137fc6006d00b0fea27f","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1954947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugen Kürschner","original_name":"Eugen Kürschner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6577137320ecaf00ad85fad2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0412750","wikidata_id":"Q22000277","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18257,"name":"educational"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
