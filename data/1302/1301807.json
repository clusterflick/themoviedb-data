This was done by their own Pakistani Army. An estimated 3 million people were killed, 10 million people were displaced to India as refugees and 400,000 women and girls were raped by the Pakistani soldiers. But Pakistan was not alone in perpetrating this violence. The then-American president and the National Security Advisor were supporting the Pakistani dictator. The cold war triggered this geopolitical escalation. Finally, India pressurized by the 10 million refugees within its borders, went to war with Pakistan. and joining forces with the local rebels, the Mukti Bahini, helped liberate Bangladesh. Cradled in the blood of innocents, a new nation was born in the closing days of 1971. \"Bay of Blood\", brings this 50-odd-year-old story to life.","popularity":0.4576,"poster_path":"/snUAyN4yMw5cNk1YtyyDZreZkgj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":204838,"logo_path":null,"name":"Earthhart Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2023-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bay of Blood","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3591800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krishnendu Bose","original_name":"Krishnendu Bose","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666478c766f19234356de1c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3591800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krishnendu Bose","original_name":"Krishnendu Bose","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6664790e77a85a02fb78c928","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2507900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moinak Guho","original_name":"Moinak Guho","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/4tYZvIePy93ZEZDEQLbAJzdyBUo.jpg","credit_id":"6664791a3cb92986da825be4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093191,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Madhurima Sen Bose","original_name":"Madhurima Sen Bose","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66647a107b48394276826119","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3591800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krishnendu Bose","original_name":"Krishnendu Bose","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66647a1a274882d337e0b166","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31124237","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/snUAyN4yMw5cNk1YtyyDZreZkgj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e9fpk7rU7YJ0nyMxGIbr6VVynSY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/afLQUasYEMbTmVVSoM5muheGUYV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1228,"name":"1970s"},{"id":15061,"name":"docudrama"},{"id":156053,"name":"bangladesh"},{"id":192772,"name":"historical drama"},{"id":213489,"name":"bengali"},{"id":246533,"name":"political conflict"},{"id":266827,"name":"bangladesh liberation war"},{"id":298588,"name":"bangladeshi history"},{"id":307587,"name":"crime documentary"},{"id":321490,"name":"historical documentary"},{"id":331417,"name":"historical events"},{"id":339455,"name":"bengali revolutionary"},{"id":346671,"name":"pakistani dramas"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
