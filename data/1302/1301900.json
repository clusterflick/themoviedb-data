He has never left his town, and for 32 years, he has woken up at the same time and gone to the same river to try to catch fish. Amidst all this sameness, what keeps Teng tightly bound to life is a story his father told him. When he goes home in the evening and can embrace his children, every day becomes the best day of his life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/kK5f74JPANiHVcvHluZKkhO2tAK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Best Day In My Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4763367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Semih Sağman","original_name":"Semih Sağman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6664b2c658aa8a93bde0b5c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kK5f74JPANiHVcvHluZKkhO2tAK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
