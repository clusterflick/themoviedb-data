A group of young men, some of them teenagers, voluntarily enlists in a rigorous military program within the Peruvian Armed Forces. They are driven by their desire to engage in an ongoing armed conflict in the VRAEM, an area with military intervention framed by a 'war on drugs' policy.  They aspire to become ‘men of war’ and embark on a transformative journey from hopeful adventurers into soldiers. Amidst the violence in the secluded military environment in Peru, intimate moments unfold beyond a prejudiced gaze, where compassion and care blossom among them.","popularity":0.1106,"poster_path":"/sPB32IwYLMAtL0uObQT1DMzPTlu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137163,"logo_path":null,"name":"PCM Post","origin_country":""},{"id":186776,"logo_path":"/A176EDfYm8735poWR6KQLF1dMGB.png","name":"Elías Querejeta Zine Eskola","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Has Come","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paolo Tizón","original_name":"Paolo Tizón","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66648f94c0dbf06dd5522fa7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paolo Tizón","original_name":"Paolo Tizón","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66648fa43cb92986da825cf7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paolo Tizón","original_name":"Paolo Tizón","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66648fb164749256da8c5882","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2309669,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Darch","original_name":"Jonathan Darch","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66648fc69caecfa72cb7635f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3181988,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Martín Solá","original_name":"Martín Solá","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66648fde5c4b52b2464147ae","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paolo Tizón","original_name":"Paolo Tizón","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66648fea38fd19819b4147b7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1145031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Castro","original_name":"Diana Castro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6664900a298a22dbafefd637","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32478330","wikidata_id":"Q127271886","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ifcSj9fBZ5xaZoIIC9YRZ6D19AE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j94SdEMt9VUguOeNfAxLGcBxUh4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1605,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/yBhrBlo7xBABu2oZQuTB0lSDTX0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1074},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sPB32IwYLMAtL0uObQT1DMzPTlu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Karlovy Vary International Film Festival ","release_date":"2024-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinélatino Film Festival ","release_date":"2025-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
