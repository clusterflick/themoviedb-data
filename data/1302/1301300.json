Tasked with a pivotal mission against the British, the boy's internal conflict escalates when he's required to prove his loyalty through the assassination of a British informant.  As the consequences of his actions unfold, the narrative intricately weaves the fate of an orphaned little girl into the tapestry of loyalty, sacrifice, and the relentless struggle for independence.  Set against the socio-political turbulence of the era, this historical drama delves into the profound choices individuals make within the complex fabric of a nation's fight for freedom and intertwines the tumultuous events of the Indian Independence Struggle with the haunting realities of children caught in conflict zones.","popularity":0.5483,"poster_path":"/FSS00djkoayGw7r5OAb8u8pZSe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":231033,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flutterby
