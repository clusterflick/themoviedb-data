His schizophrenia devastated his life and that of his kin. His sister Laura struggled to understand Maury’s destructive behavior and the limits of her help as she fought to keep her beloved family intact. When Maury died at age 58, Laura discovered over 1400 paintings, sketches, and journal writings that revealed his rich, tormented inner world and demonstrated how painting had saved him. OUTSIDER unfolds visually through Maury’s art and through his writings, voiced by comedian Gary Gulman. The film presents a rarely seen, unvarnished view of a family’s painful journey with mental illness and captures an unexpected way they found connection.","popularity":0.2997,"poster_path":"/i14NyxfKrTnqi6Pnx59hM79X8XA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outsider","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Gulman","original_name":"Gary Gulman","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/luX8IjBnUrfMAvpkkaGibX7feqG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Journals of Maury Ornest","credit_id":"6663c524417d4c33503cbb76","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2045089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanmarie Simpson","original_name":"Jeanmarie Simpson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6663c52f17cc9c6d283cc4c3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1258040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Haimes","original_name":"Ted Haimes","popularity":0.1191,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6663c54f3cb92986da824efd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Lucas Haimes","original_name":"Nicole Lucas Haimes","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6663c5658fbdc8fabd505f8b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13496830","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1618,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i14NyxfKrTnqi6Pnx59hM79X8XA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1078}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
