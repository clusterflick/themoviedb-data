Drawing its title from Chinese writer and artist Su Dongpo’s (1037 - 1101) poetry that meditates upon the transitory nature of life during a period of political exile, the exhibition is seen as a manifesto that encourages the act of listening as a form of activism. Conceived as a single landscape or artwork organised into song-like movements or ‘cantos’ that are inspired by American poet Ezra Pound’s (1885 - 1972) journey through history in The Cantos (1925), the exhibition brings together eight multimedia and sound installations.","popularity":0.2237,"poster_path":"/eDM9L8OEgXeOLVtQjvFpkWEVnrU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36729,"logo_path":"/803v2rFNe5WCkCm14juwaFQOJts.png","name":"Smoking Dog
