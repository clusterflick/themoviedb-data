June 1944, the Allies landed in Normandy. This odyssey was meticulously prepared for months. The construction of two artificial ports, the transport of Anglo-American troops, their training cost colossal efforts, and caused many cold sweats: the secret of D-Day almost came to light several times. The documentary reveals the inner workings of Operation Overlord, it also deciphers the military operations, and evokes the choices of the high command. Placed at human level, it retraces the fate of Norman civilians subjected to deadly bombings, the attitude of the Allied soldiers and their German adversaries, as well as the aspirations of the French population, torn between fear and hope.","popularity":0.3267,"poster_path":"/iGx4PNd4KVRTYSKXJfiZVExo4Qi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16888,"logo_path":"/di3Bw89NYi83N769K6wYnqqSFHS.png","name":"ZED","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":22123,"logo_path":"/zPTy6QDAlCKGeAALZoFEL3QAlut.png","name":"TF1","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":123263,"logo_path":"/lH6LuTXRNVncmI4fJwohv2FqgpO.png","name":"ECPAD","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"D-Day, 100 jours pour la liberté","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éric Caravaca","original_name":"Éric Caravaca","popularity":0.2736,"profile_path":"/yJkhAfF1flznA2GzLWah2nDecIa.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrateur","credit_id":"6662fabc3f3830f7ce762c62","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":308811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Korn-Brzoza","original_name":"David Korn-Brzoza","popularity":0.1585,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66621690a12e2b8686d9f13c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565440,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Louis Goldschmit","original_name":"Louis Goldschmit","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6662f9bb229e39925208ad5d","department":"Crew","job":"Sequence Lead"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1503662,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olivier Wieviorka","original_name":"Olivier Wieviorka","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/s5feiziYDCkQbZRQ2XjSQr5VZ2e.jpg","credit_id":"6662f882ecffff9d803ca475","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302601,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marie Corberand","original_name":"Marie Corberand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6662f9f7ab47781f59d00b3b","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debbie Ford","original_name":"Debbie Ford","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6662fa0b0c266f93b2133b62","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926724,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Baptiste Thiry","original_name":"Baptiste Thiry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6662fb7b2b56ebaf06763503","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bzFETo51Zv4MjZTUlkijt6FSjf9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/iGx4PNd4KVRTYSKXJfiZVExo4Qi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8XVGUGQ3DaJM169rHdIHAWW3IIN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":849}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":9156,"name":"d-day"},{"id":260885,"name":"débarquement"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":294205,"name":"war documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
