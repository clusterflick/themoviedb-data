Drawn to churches as an easy mark to steal candles for her sick mother, she is caught by a grieving choir director and set a penance of polishing the church pews. The most unlikely friendship emerges as Cricket finds her true gift to the world and unlocks a channel through which both student and choir director can face their own fears and emotions. This is a lyrical film about love, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit.","popularity":1.3018,"poster_path":"/zbmdZjnQKkgVdhtAV27A2JH3DzG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":230897,"logo_path":null,"name":"Green Pastures Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A young girl coming to terms with her mother's looming death finds her voice through the most unlikely of friendships.","title":"Cricket","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2435853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skye Dakota Turner","original_name":"Skye Dakota Turner","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":"/urM8JN3lDti8kvPy9E4H4VQVvJu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cricket","credit_id":"66634190bba82d1fb7762be0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Leal","original_name":"Carlos Leal","popularity":0.2848,"profile_path":"/fTAQuYmGJygoUZgn1SWIA7Un7Gq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Luc","credit_id":"666341e03fe987df2b18904e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2432756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blythe Howard","original_name":"Blythe Howard","popularity":0.2215,"profile_path":"/bBaE8oyF8N1729PoE7SSVNQcbmN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Fran","credit_id":"66634202e75bd514553ca668","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Black","original_name":"James Black","popularity":0.252,"profile_path":"/nC3jHGBYxQTFKZ9tEct7alNeqOz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sully","credit_id":"66634222046e9e0828dd434e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2130055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Faly Rakotohavana","original_name":"Faly Rakotohavana","popularity":0.1778,"profile_path":"/niSMtHM1xRqp2wSwRgSs7Zx1gy6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Euwin","credit_id":"66634235446eb15e6218902e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Duffy","original_name":"Kate Duffy","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/wvFcRc155rfwFQDXHgE217mhb5e.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Laney","credit_id":"66634273417d4c33503ca3aa","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2513214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Nichols","original_name":"Frances Nichols","popularity":0.2949,"profile_path":"/nHPGoUrtfG34jfSyDt4oq4Y1Lo6.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bev","credit_id":"666342ab229e39925208b093","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4761390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriella David","original_name":"Gabriella David","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Ruthie","credit_id":"666342e77e2cdec61d133f74","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1229219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Janes","original_name":"Richard Janes","popularity":0.1315,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666343497b08d38e8d08aab8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2942245,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tameson Duffy","original_name":"Tameson Duffy","popularity":0.1522,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666343675181160b2e09d4bc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33290,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Justin Burnett","original_name":"Justin Burnett","popularity":0.1131,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666343882b8f2a8860503f86","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3190673,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mego Lin","original_name":"Mego Lin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6663439655bce1fae0d00799","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22065,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ricki Maslar","original_name":"Ricki Maslar","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":"/zRCcqnHH34BKeG6OkkM4qtjtTU7.jpg","credit_id":"666343c0e462678f7e133cbd","department":"Production","job":"Casting"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1516798,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rebekah Bell","original_name":"Rebekah Bell","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66634422f9bf41f0fa503f42","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2940153,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Valerie L.
