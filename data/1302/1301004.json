Since I had very little time to make my own art, placing my cell phone on the windows of these trains and trying to capture these pieces of graffiti felt like it was at least celebrating this form of art. On these incredible old walls along the Montclair-Boonton line, there are people making beautiful art along the rail.\"","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Along The Rail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4759439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Harkel","original_name":"Jonathan Harkel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6661f272a1abd4f3f9b93812","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4759439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Harkel","original_name":"Jonathan Harkel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6661f25665d89e3f4219ddc5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New Jersey International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
