From all over the world scientists have gathered a living collection of plants and flowers, providing delight for the casual visitor and rich material for the student of botany. The actual process of plant growth is revealed for us by the time-lapse camera. We see a practical result of the botanist’s work in British Columbia’s important seed industry. Children, too, at the Montreal Botanical Gardens, cultivating their own plots of ground, take part in the quest for the secrets of nature.","popularity":0.1522,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1948-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Science in Bloom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4760249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Sherman","original_name":"John Sherman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"666264f99122fe9facfbbb31","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639411,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Douglas Tunstell","original_name":"Douglas Tunstell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666264c4d5441817cd731bc2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591110,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Petel","original_name":"Pierre Petel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666264556379d939eb731e43","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3347589,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Fleming","original_name":"Robert Fleming","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6662649da6587a66b93c9e3f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicholas Balla","original_name":"Nicholas Balla","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6662643cd8d9ccc21c089245","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3807824,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John K.
