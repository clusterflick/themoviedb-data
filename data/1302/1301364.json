This poetic and at times tragicomic film follows the last remaining inhabitants from the perspective of several domesticated animals.

wind.","popularity":0.1626,"poster_path":"/96OKZCcqu6Y24S7yvXPc9BOQQqt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151483,"logo_path":"/rCwpsCQCvUqWZXdPXMHaWTPtbBq.png","name":"Wood Water
