Varn & Son oyster and crab factory in Pin Point closed its doors for good. It marked the end of an era for the tiny fishing community tucked quietly away on the banks of the Moon River, just south of Savannah, Georgia. For nearly one hundred years, Pin Point was isolated and self sustained, a Gullah/Geechee enclave founded by first-generation freedmen where family, religion and work were deeply connected to the water. Today, it is the last of its kind.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Take Me to the Water: The Story of Pin Point","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2231543","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
