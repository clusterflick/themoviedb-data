Back in his hometown, he makes periodic book releases, published in a DIY fashion, in obscure and ephemeral bars, but with a core for a certain local bohemia, on the way to extinction. The film calmly reflects on this end of a lifestyle that already belongs to another era.","popularity":0.0477,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un mal rebel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3182553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bogdan Pușlenghea","original_name":"Bogdan Pușlenghea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6664214791f6dfec47e16686","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
