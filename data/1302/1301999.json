'The long night is ended, the morning draws nigh,' sums up the feelings of those who are sped through immigration formalities on their way to a fresh existence. Though the language may be different, these new Canadians soon find things in Canada that remind them of Holland, Poland or Belgium. Some immigrants carry on with their old trades--sewing, farming, diamond cutting. Others, on huge projects such as Des Joachims, use their muscles to help build their adopted homeland, while their love of culture and their skilled professions will make valuable contributions to Canada in the future.","popularity":0.0749,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1949-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passport to Canada","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Scott","original_name":"John Scott","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narration (voice)","credit_id":"6664e1dd16f44ab1929e7df2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352219,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Blais","original_name":"Roger Blais","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6664e13a9122c33cf4fcb538","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57293,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Sydney Newman","original_name":"Sydney Newman","popularity":0.212,"profile_path":"/QKW3Widw7yaemYlB3NKEmJrhrF.jpg","credit_id":"6664e145fc9112f44eefd937","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415578,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Len Peterson","original_name":"Len Peterson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6664e16fb81f32098778cc9c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2875051,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Marie Couture","original_name":"Jean-Marie Couture","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6664e17f541313f0d7b76539","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4763685,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nick Ball","original_name":"Nick Ball","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6664e19171fc82f363e0b50b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639598,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Clifford Griffin","original_name":"Clifford Griffin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6664e1a071fc82f363e0b50e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639411,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Douglas Tunstell","original_name":"Douglas Tunstell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6664e1ac16f44ab1929e7ded","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicholas Balla","original_name":"Nicholas Balla","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6664e1b7928d198a5c825f1b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085822,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maurice Blackburn","original_name":"Maurice Blackburn","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6664e1c947aede50cb9e7d4d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0263843","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
