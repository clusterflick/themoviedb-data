He was a presence, a brand, and the only one who rivaled Hitchcock as the greatest showman and self-promoter of his generation. But toward the end of his career, his attempts to \"get with the times\" (with films like Skidoo, Tell Me That You Love Me Junie Moon, Such Good Friends, Hurry Sundown, and others) shocked, alienated, and outright repelled audiences. What happened to Otto and how can one best appreciate and enjoy those confounding later works?","popularity":0.1745,"poster_path":"/iJpZbsMqheunuj8f6BUNFHeoSLs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Ecstasy of Tree-Climber Otto, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Late Preminger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otto Preminger","original_name":"Otto Preminger","popularity":0.2887,"profile_path":"/zmJuWBIbWURkB138eD9IPVzpAUt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66632d083fb55bba1809c1d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66632d14a6587a66b93cb192","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"66632cfabfe538266709c183","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"66632ce66b4346569c83453f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"66632cefd3a6d9b215dd42ed","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21373800","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1422,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iJpZbsMqheunuj8f6BUNFHeoSLs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":993}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
