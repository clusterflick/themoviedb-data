The film asks a familiar set of questions in a new historical moment: What is an \"authentic\" performance? What is \"realism\"? What is a “positive” or “negative” image? Re-posing questions that also animated Clarke’s film, Portrait of Turner challenges its audience to reflect on its own, sometimes pleasurable and sometimes uncomfortable, relation to the figure before the camera.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait of Turner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
