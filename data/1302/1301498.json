Dima's young coach helps him approach the matter correctly: maintain the pace, calculate the load, and hold out until the finish line. In the 15 minutes that the film lasts, we will see the entire range of emotions between them, from irritation to sincere support, and also learn a lot about Ilya: what he strives for when he stopped seeing what he considers important in life and what is nonsense. The director shoots the characters on grainy black-and-white film, interspersing jogging and conversations with surreal, fantasy portrait shots, separates the dialogue from the picture and stitches the film with a pulsating soundtrack, reassembles the material as a collage, creating an unusual and surprisingly integral aesthetic.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/hnCmMcPsOApTyX2pY5Q5HHgS3pS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":260342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reason Pictures (RU)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"4:30","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5393562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilya Miklashevksy","original_name":"Ilya Miklashevksy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"680a48a18bcea66a86aaa093","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5393563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitry Motorniy","original_name":"Dmitry Motorniy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"680a48ac142b09cecf8a484f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4761669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasily Ovchinnikov","original_name":"Vasily Ovchinnikov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66636b63dda42fef2d50414e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5393564,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Oleg Kolsky","original_name":"Oleg Kolsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680a48bf142b09cecf8a485e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5393565,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ilia Symphocat","original_name":"Ilia Symphocat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680a48c9f3cf6d66d79d112d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3289696,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roman Vorobyev","original_name":"Roman Vorobyev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680a48d78bcea66a86aaa0a1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34964146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6QS6EINZuAXFwaJm4XvGONC9ilw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hnCmMcPsOApTyX2pY5Q5HHgS3pS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"4:30 short doc - trailer #CSFF24","key":"6SvgaFAIlZ8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-10-22T21:01:26.000Z","id":"680a483c276bf64e41abb323"}]}}}
