When a mysterious car appears, he exhibits more lust than sense and steps right into the web of a demonic Black Widow Queen. She'll leave him buried in the ground by day while she livesa normal life in the city. By night she returns to unearth him, to wake him from his eternal daze and toss him into the backseat ofa \"ghost car\" that car drives itself. The windows fog up and the lovers drift off into a smoky in-between place, where she takes on monstrously sensual new forms with which to devour him.","popularity":0.1368,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Ride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1881954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chrystabell","original_name":"Chrystabell","popularity":0.229,"profile_path":"/mBDbXsPjaZWJf6uB3US8eo6b8hs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Black Widow Queen","credit_id":"66624ae8c0e007bcbb7df341","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4760145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Claudia Simão de Oliveira","original_name":"Ana Claudia Simão de Oliveira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Spider Lady 2","credit_id":"66624b40ed15290654adb60d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2901254,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dave Insley","original_name":"Dave Insley","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Radio Preacher (voice)","credit_id":"66624b6be0cdcbc67992e8db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":57267,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gina Rosenblum","original_name":"Gina Rosenblum","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Old Man","credit_id":"66624bb224ade40201f22ddc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Silverman","original_name":"Lauren Silverman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Spider Lady 1","credit_id":"66624bd2ab47781f59cfe13a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4760152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Skorman","original_name":"Joseph Skorman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Drifter","credit_id":"66624cb2328c69728248be63","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4760152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Skorman","original_name":"Joseph Skorman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66624c1563da7eae29adb5f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1881954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chrystabell","original_name":"Chrystabell","popularity":0.229,"profile_path":"/mBDbXsPjaZWJf6uB3US8eo6b8hs.jpg","credit_id":"66624cd044342cecfd9b055c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lynch","original_name":"David Lynch","popularity":1.7106,"profile_path":"/b6TnSpuqeOlbq7aHH9G4inmQ1v9.jpg","credit_id":"66624cdca10ad0e0fdcfe15e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1643297,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike Revolvalcke","original_name":"Mike Revolvalcke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66624d02eb74b4775a92e8db","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4760152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Skorman","original_name":"Joseph Skorman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66624d1115f768a020cfe15e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4760153,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonathan Mindes","original_name":"Jonathan Mindes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66624c7a1fe5ede4ff75fe99","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4760153,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonathan Mindes","original_name":"Jonathan Mindes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66624c439122fe9facfbaa39","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1881954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chrystabell","original_name":"Chrystabell","popularity":0.229,"profile_path":"/mBDbXsPjaZWJf6uB3US8eo6b8hs.jpg","credit_id":"66624c60d4732f1576087854","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4760152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Skorman","original_name":"Joseph Skorman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66624d26229e399252087840","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8235572","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Marfa Film Festival","release_date":"2017-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
