The material so upset the FBI that they closely monitored the production up until the eve of its premiere, recruiting crew members as moles. The irony is rich, as Uptight was a remake of John Ford's The Informer (1935) and dealt with a turncoat character who engineers the assassination of a revolutionary leader. How is Uptight both an outlier (or anomaly) as well as simultaneously integral to the career of Jules Dassin?","popularity":0.1111,"poster_path":"/5ItyaiCAhlCCZyWU1I3ShkjIjTb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elective Vicissitudes: The Radical Exiles of Jules Dassin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"666323879c304a2609d0084a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules Dassin","original_name":"Jules Dassin","popularity":0.2315,"profile_path":"/xpqWHWQfKBloBzuO3n0zkV4sXrW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66632391c597ada6a8d00faa","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"6663237b32248508d008a322","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"666323705181160b2e09d37f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"66632362d3a6d9b215dd429c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27046651","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1422,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ItyaiCAhlCCZyWU1I3ShkjIjTb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1002}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
