When the museum director examined the body, he found a diary from whose entries he could deduce the reason for the suicide: Starling had once come across a mummy and a papyrus scroll on a trip to Egypt and had given both artifacts to the museum upon his return. Starling was able to deduce from the papyrus scroll with the cuneiform writing that the mummy, once a king's daughter, would one day awaken and then live as long as the mummy wanted.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":137027,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmag","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1920-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Narr und Tod","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2556550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Kresse","original_name":"Lisa Kresse","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66622a9efcd0952eae97f5b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":13907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Goetz","original_name":"Carl Goetz","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66622aa80a00b7f24c1f5f03","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dora Kaiser","original_name":"Dora Kaiser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66622ab0f60f78d84997f59d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2464648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Lackner","original_name":"Hans Lackner","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66622ab8572a53f6818c39da","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1473965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Kronegg","original_name":"Paul Kronegg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66622ac0c0bc3b3cf8961ad3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2388144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudolf Stiaßny","original_name":"Rudolf Stiaßny","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66622a54424554a1c89f8300","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1999403,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Siegfried Geyer","original_name":"Siegfried Geyer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66622a63424554a1c89f8303","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1325221,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Max Nekut","original_name":"Max Nekut","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66622a94aef5cc2b6bcc56b2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2388144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudolf Stiaßny","original_name":"Rudolf Stiaßny","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66622a8730d3d6adeb97f5b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1649076","wikidata_id":"Q19794079","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1920-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
