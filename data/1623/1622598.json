Line readings are consistently dull, and the portly actor Robert Dunn playing Big Daddy gets to ham it up. Star billling goes to his nurse Tanya Rivers, a hint that she will have more to do in the story than all those greedy relatives.  There's no screenplay credit and it stinks. The many sex scenes mix and match cast members and make no sense, just \"time for a threesome\" or other porno logic at work instead. There's nobody to root for, building to a surprise, very stupid ending.  The only point of interest for me was wondering who played the doctor, who is uncredited. He returns at the end with a long recitation scene, and I realized it is Jake Jacobs, the cinematographer (and later actor playing \"older man\" roles as \"Jay Crew\").","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7qU5KtBFLSbFM32wjBqcr3S86am.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sin City","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Hearts","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1135479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ona Zee","original_name":"Ona Zee","popularity":7.798,"profile_path":"/kRyvJHCTDKojLSDHZXgO8s4VZ8d.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6975fbab245dffe8bc1a0d88","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1610022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gail Force","original_name":"Gail Force","popularity":8.355,"profile_path":"/1hD5XYSGGYoU3zvZuyzLHcGCFVh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6975fbb8eef28af4adeaf2d0","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5961451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracy Wynn","original_name":"Tracy Wynn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6975fbd15ade9bd45fa381ac","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2795720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brittany Ashland","original_name":"Brittany Ashland","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6975fbdede9bfb62a1a37fe8","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1481403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marissa Malibu","original_name":"Marissa Malibu","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/qoGcEGS8goAdrB6eUAKhybCfYBr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6975fbeceef28af4adeaf2d5","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":140399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Morgan","original_name":"Jonathan Morgan","popularity":1.908,"profile_path":"/tkFSElHNdYnZhtn101YSsDiFh2v.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6975fbfb0407af05681063d0","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1807640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Jacobs","original_name":"Jane Jacobs","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6975fc0e0407af05681063d7","order":6},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4569491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Chapman","original_name":"Tom Chapman","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6975fc2ff86fb26d481a0999","order":7},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5961452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Summers","original_name":"Wayne Summers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6975fc3b1a5808a26ceaf0f1","order":8},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4565934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Dunn","original_name":"Robert Dunn","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6975fc4e9b7f5906f8088a25","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2350067,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charles Grey","original_name":"Charles Grey","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6975fc70a97f552df8eaf21d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0181160","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7qU5KtBFLSbFM32wjBqcr3S86am.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
