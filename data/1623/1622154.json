Alabama sailed over 75,000 miles and captured more than 60 Union merchant ships. For two years the \"ghost ship\" wreaked havoc--until the U.S.S. Kearsage caught up with her in a French port where she had pulled in for repairs. Out-manned and out-gunned, the Alabama sank to the bottom of the English Channel. We join marine archaeologist Gordon Watts and a team of U.S. and French divers as they attempt to excavate the wreck and recover artifacts.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dREcleFQZ1wDuFSw2WfLyjJ4gOM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115122,"logo_path":null,"name":"KPI Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raise the Alabama!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5959710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Watts","original_name":"Gordon Watts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6974cc1d00b2fac184ae2de1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1672868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Stebner","original_name":"Greg Stebner","popularity":0.0675,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6974cefbc5ccae5007ab9434","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5959717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike DeWitt","original_name":"Mike DeWitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6974cc7dddf0ebe1a4693fe3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5959717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike DeWitt","original_name":"Mike DeWitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6974ccb1ff3c3e485cab936b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5959727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vinnie Kralyevich","original_name":"Vinnie Kralyevich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6974cec6c5ccae5007ab942d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0288187","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dREcleFQZ1wDuFSw2WfLyjJ4gOM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":179585,"name":"american civil war"},{"id":195396,"name":"archaeological expedition"},{"id":221689,"name":"military history"},{"id":226475,"name":"naval battle"},{"id":254104,"name":"underwater archaeology"},{"id":366346,"name":"uss kearsarge"},{"id":366347,"name":"css alabama"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
