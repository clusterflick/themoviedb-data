Haunted by family, silence, and the remnants of her former self, she begins to break free. Thailand becomes her place of rebirth — not escape, but transformation. The film reclaims Nietzsche’s concept of the Overman — not as a cold superhuman ideal, but as a fragile, feminine figure shedding skin through pain, love, and spiritual resistance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":74745,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mojo Raiser Production","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2026-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Pārcilvēks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584911,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guna Stahovska","original_name":"Guna Stahovska","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697690bf85b34dd3eceaf425","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584911,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guna Stahovska","original_name":"Guna Stahovska","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697690cd0407af0568106735","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2044645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Tontegode","original_name":"Ivars Tontegode","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/pn4kIdxXAqmFdZd0mLmWeqDpzfA.jpg","credit_id":"697690df53700cebcb694c27","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2044645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Tontegode","original_name":"Ivars Tontegode","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/pn4kIdxXAqmFdZd0mLmWeqDpzfA.jpg","credit_id":"697690eb2ef4e92e411a0d6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2271604,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mārtiņš Jurēvics","original_name":"Mārtiņš Jurēvics","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697690fe4426c0b9d81068dd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4296444,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elizabete Junga-Tontegode","original_name":"Elizabete Junga-Tontegode","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6976911878931672ac1a0e49","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Artdocfest/Riga","release_date":"2026-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
