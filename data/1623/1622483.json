Once forced from their homeland in Central Afghanistan, they now live under constant threat from Taliban violence, clinging to everyday rituals and the dreams of two young daughters who embody their hope for the future. At once intimate and poetic, Hazara Town is a meditation on exile, resilience, and the enduring strength of love in the face of uncertainty.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hazara Town","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2846045,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Khadim Dai","original_name":"Khadim Dai","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6975a029c814ed8d0010616f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3549026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilyas Yourish","original_name":"Ilyas Yourish","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6975a0458cfdc03f6708856c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4803161,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Graeme Isaac","original_name":"Graeme Isaac","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6975a0a5c9dd574a6ba36cb4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4526643,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anke Petersen","original_name":"Anke Petersen","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6975a0b5a8664ba195ae3284","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
