In Kolkata, a Hindu-Marwari filmmaker prepares to end her marriage while her mother devotes herself to arranging her brother’s bride. Between these parallel searches — for divorce and for a bride — unfolds a study of devotion, silence, and defiance. Through intimate filmmaking, she challenges these expectations, exposing contradictions and seeking personal liberation. This film is her attempt to reclaim agency, question inherited beliefs, and spark dialogue on autonomy and identity. Layering observation with personal reflection, the film questions who defines virtue, who carries the weight of tradition, and ultimately, what it means to be 'A Good Wife.'","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/q8oK76arzySSg5DiQNFUp9FIe1W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":287243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Purple percept Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2025-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Good Wife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5961598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anuradha Bansal","original_name":"Anuradha Bansal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mfZskxNZHbgrddkCvl3kBLPcbB8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69761942d9573a80e50889f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5961599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krishna Bansal","original_name":"Krishna Bansal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6976194c8739a0b05deaf28d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5961600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deepak Bansal","original_name":"Deepak Bansal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6976195b2495071dfd106743","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5961603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rakesh Bansal","original_name":"Rakesh Bansal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"69761971224ce62398eaf134","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5961598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anuradha Bansal","original_name":"Anuradha Bansal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mfZskxNZHbgrddkCvl3kBLPcbB8.jpg","credit_id":"69761db8d49f6f8154694501","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5961598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anuradha Bansal","original_name":"Anuradha Bansal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mfZskxNZHbgrddkCvl3kBLPcbB8.jpg","credit_id":"69761dc39511ad0892a37086","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5961598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anuradha Bansal","original_name":"Anuradha Bansal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mfZskxNZHbgrddkCvl3kBLPcbB8.jpg","credit_id":"69761dcfc9dd574a6ba36e50","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5961598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anuradha Bansal","original_name":"Anuradha Bansal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mfZskxNZHbgrddkCvl3kBLPcbB8.jpg","credit_id":"69761ddf7da53b9ffca36ef3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4520376,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sheshank Kumar","original_name":"Sheshank Kumar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69761df392afc4166fa38470","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776456,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Subhadeep Sengupta","original_name":"Subadeep Sengupta","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69761dff8739a0b05deaf2a5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5961615,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sabyasachi Pal","original_name":"Sabyasachi Pal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69761e23ef911f4ad2a38110","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39139808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oAaMGFzaoqRRZJc5pzxzaq0Pdon.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q8oK76arzySSg5DiQNFUp9FIe1W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
