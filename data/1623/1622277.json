The film follows Jim Dunn, a man living with HIV who chooses to participate in UC San Diego’s Last Gift Study, a pioneering research effort enabling people nearing death to donate their bodies to science immediately after passing, helping researchers uncover where HIV persists despite treatment.  Through intimate conversations, reflections on mortality, and moments shared with his wife Susan, clinicians, advocates, and scientists, the film reveals Jim’s profound desire to contribute to a future free of HIV. With honesty and grace, it captures the emotional complexity of end-of-life decisions and the extraordinary courage behind them. Jim’s legacy reminds us that scientific progress is built not only on data, but on human generosity, relationships, and hope.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jcQ7AhdFndvOC0mMI8dO7dvzfOq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":287164,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clear Creative Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Last Gift: Jim's Courage, Our Hope reminds us that science and humanity are forever intertwined - and that one person's choice can change the future.","title":"The Last Gift: Jim's Courage Our Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5960247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Neisz","original_name":"Ryan Neisz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69752b7be1d733d98c1a0744","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5960248,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nadir Weibel","original_name":"Nadir Weibel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69752b8a3e364077ab1a0739","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5960249,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Gianella Weibel","original_name":"Sara Gianella Weibel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69752b949511ad0892a36a10","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5960250,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patricia Defechereux","original_name":"Patricia Defechereux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69752ba900b2fac184ae306b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5960251,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Noah Weibel","original_name":"Noah Weibel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69752c08f976e43fbdab953e","department":"Writing","job":"Lyricist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5960251,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Noah Weibel","original_name":"Noah Weibel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69752c21d57314d6aca369d5","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5960254,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Noah Weibel","original_name":"Noah Weibel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69752c7f7250d9fd6f6942fb","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39306593","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k7Hw48cjXW6ge5DOBRzXP9AxhX9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jcQ7AhdFndvOC0mMI8dO7dvzfOq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3664,"name":"research"},{"id":5890,"name":"community"},{"id":9766,"name":"hiv"},{"id":262235,"name":"hiv/aids epidemic"},{"id":299723,"name":"end of life"},{"id":312666,"name":"altruistic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Beach Break Film Festival, Half Moon Bay, CA, USA","release_date":"2025-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
