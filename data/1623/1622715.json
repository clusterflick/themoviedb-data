At the same time as it takes a close look at the personalities and work of these two courageous artists, the film pays tribute to Soutter, as a passionate painter who is still relatively unknown, to Thomas Zehetmair, a violinist whose inflamed style, extreme concentration and total commitment have inspired the composer and finally to Heinz Hollinger himself, a composer and conductor whose mastery, generosity and depth of musical understanding are self-evident.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/w3tiMWC3YhP6odKOPz6BZhMErjq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadows – Genesis of Heinz Holliger’s “Violin Concerto, Hommage to Louis Soutter”","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1647005,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edna Politi","original_name":"Edna Politi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697642c7f4c29d9821106634","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1647005,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edna Politi","original_name":"Edna Politi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697642d680832b8a201a0d5d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5961870,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philippe Albèra","original_name":"Philippe Albèra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697642ed129ad22070ae36c7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5961872,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Axel Brandt","original_name":"Axel Brandt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6976431def6e956254a36f4c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7611,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Denis Jutzeler","original_name":"Denis Jutzeler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6976433222a8dae15aa381b6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1603625,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elisabeth Waelchli","original_name":"Elisabeth Waelchli","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697643598f929b7eef088a72","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1647005,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edna Politi","original_name":"Edna Politi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69764370387e9e10bba36df6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1012,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Mp5DB5S2nZnHwR8cTufAxHM2f9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1013,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/huXmbtAtPXdwitYJnOAZ17C8BaV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":801,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w3tiMWC3YhP6odKOPz6BZhMErjq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nyon, 28e Festival Int. du Cinéma Documentaire ","release_date":"1997-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
