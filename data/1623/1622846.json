The trip ran from Meredith, New Hampshire south to the state capital, Concord New Hampshire!  This trip travels along the Lakes Region of Central New Hampshire, through many of the popular towns of Laconia, Tilton, and Northfield on its way to Concord!  The rails were once part of the Boston & Maine network that ran to the White Mountains. The trip included two different railroads: The Winnipesaukee Scenic and the New England Southern Railroad. Winnipesaukee Scenic operated to Northfield where New England Southern took over and ran on freight-only trackage to Concord!
