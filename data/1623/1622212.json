In 2018, after nearly a decade of speculation and uncertainty, the rickety little flame-painted building on the corner of Third Avenue and Atlantic announced they would finally be closing their doors for good. This feature documentary follows Hank's-along with its colorful staff and rotating cast of oddball patrons-through the bar's stressful and celebratory final months. It also takes a deep-dive into the fascinating history of the building, from its roots as a working-class Irish saloon, through its various roles as a Prohibition speakeasy, First Nations ironworker hangout, and crack-era safe haven, up to its final incarnation as a quintessential \"old man bar\" turned legendary indie music venue, all pitted against the backdrop of a rapidly changing New York City.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hank's Saloon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39319838","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
