Germany claims to remember, yet repression thrives beneath the mask of democracy.\r Set in Berlin, this documentary follows four activists navigating the Palestine solidarity movement and the escalating repression it faces, centering on the shutdown of the \"Palästina Kongress.\" From there, it turns to the city's student movement and its role within a growing global struggle for expression and resistance. Underneath it all runs a deeper thread, how Germany's unresolved history of fascism continues to shape its politics today.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/4RCwN1891PvXXYb24apAr5ayOXS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viva Palästina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5959888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kamal El Salim","original_name":"Kamal El Salim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6974f7eef4b98461580880dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1640,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4RCwN1891PvXXYb24apAr5ayOXS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1096}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
