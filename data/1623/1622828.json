Widely respected by folklorists and ritual enthusiasts both in Japan and abroad, Hana Matsuri is not only a spiritual tradition, but also the cultural core of the local community—an embodied memory of who they are. Like many rural areas in Japan, Tōei faces rapid population decline and shifting social structures. This film gently follows those who sustain the festival amid such changes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rycc6Yzy30aJyMNXRvWYVIcsKBk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":287276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rendering Vacation","origin_country":""},{"id":287278,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moonlight Mobile Theater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2025-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Henbe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5962336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryosuke Sato","original_name":"Ryosuke Sato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6976831bff3c3e485cab9dfe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5962336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryosuke Sato","original_name":"Ryosuke Sato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697683adddf0ebe1a46949bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38259558","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1699,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rycc6Yzy30aJyMNXRvWYVIcsKBk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Silkroad International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ドキュメンタリー映画「鬼の反閇が聞こえる」予告編","key":"dRr4KiN2HAA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-06-12T07:06:57.000Z","id":"6976828b7250d9fd6f694b3a"}]}}}
