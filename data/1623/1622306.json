Bees are small intelligent creatures with a sense of touch, but otherwise, they are not so different from us humans. When they leave the hive, they always have to first put on a yellow and black striped flight suit to look like we think they do. Bix is ​​a media bee and works in the TV tower in the city sector Apodea. It is she who, during a crisis meeting at the editorial office, hatches the idea for \"One with Man\" - a nature program about the world's strangest animal - man. The TV show becomes a huge success and changes life in Beebylon forever. The bees are starting to imitate the behavior of humans. Queen Atabar rules in Beebylon, a strict but fair regent. She follows the filmed features of the Josefsson family with interest.
