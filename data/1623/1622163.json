Johnny, a military drone pilot, executes killings by day and returns each night to a home already hollowed out. Brutal visions of the battlefields he surveils invade his life, repeating and distorting without release. Mary—abrasive, funny, and fiercely protective—dates indiscriminately, holding their shared life together through sheer force of will. When Johnny dies by suicide, reality shifts into an abstract afterlife, where personal guilt is stripped of its human scale and dissolved into something vast and impersonal.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/7fiyk8XNWVIZBdnJdIYnocpG4ev.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Variations on Violence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noelia Antweiler","original_name":"Noelia Antweiler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6974cf87d49f6f8154693f06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Lanning","original_name":"Drew Lanning","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6974cf9085b34dd3eceaea25","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5959785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krissy Garber","original_name":"Krissy Garber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"6974daeebf6d7c9c16ab9442","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5959786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zainab Sadia Saeed","original_name":"Zainab Sadia Saeed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"","credit_id":"6974daf58739a0b05deaeac5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4462132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Wilson","original_name":"Eric Wilson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"","credit_id":"6974dafeff9d26e701a36707","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5959730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zachary Nichols","original_name":"Zachary Nichols","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6974cf6dc5ccae5007ab9441","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5959730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zachary Nichols","original_name":"Zachary Nichols","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6974cf772ef4e92e411a042b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2392087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"G.
