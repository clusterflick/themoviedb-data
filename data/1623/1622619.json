A Puglian storyteller of extraordinary evocative power, Enzo Del Re is also a musician of remarkable innovative ability in musical production and in the use of humble, makeshift instruments. An icon of Apulian music, little known yet overwhelming once discovered. Through his story, three important decades of the Italian cultural scene are retraced, from Nanni Ricordi to Dario Fo, all the way to Nuova Scena and the Circoli Ottobre. Then darkness, and today the rediscovery of Del Re at the May Day concert in 2010 alongside Vinicio Capossela. Today he claims that he “did not fight for a pension, but for the revolution.”","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/wSeIL5sAbbSW2aGkCTYaKPQ0L36.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":287244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teca del mediterraneo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2010-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Chair and I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5961610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enzo Del Re","original_name":"Enzo Del Re","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"se stesso","credit_id":"69761b86fba0d3038d1a0bf1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5961611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vittorio Franceschi","original_name":"Vittorio Franceschi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"se stesso","credit_id":"69761bc42ab9f5aa5cae328e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4780291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Lolli","original_name":"Claudio Lolli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"se stesso","credit_id":"69761bd001299f968aab9fbb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3979168,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert Popovich","original_name":"Robert Popovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"se stessa","credit_id":"69761be4ea4bb301a9a37f16","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5961612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Chiagnardi Chiarchi","original_name":"Isabella Chiagnardi Chiarchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"se stessa","credit_id":"69761c062ab9f5aa5cae3299","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178676,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonio Infantino","original_name":"Antonio Infantino","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"se stesso","credit_id":"69761c174dc3007090a38295","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1466971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Ciarchi","original_name":"Paolo Ciarchi","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"se stesso","credit_id":"69761c3eddf0ebe1a4694729","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":124766,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vinicio Capossela","original_name":"Vinicio Capossela","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":"/o4OZokR4sHmPGKntM5YQ29mdltA.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"se stesso","credit_id":"69761c4fbcdceb9392a36e34","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5961613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romolo Epifania","original_name":"Romolo Epifania","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"se stesso","credit_id":"69761c5a718ea4b83910665b","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461705,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Angelo Amoroso D'Aragona","original_name":"Angelo Amoroso D'Aragona","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69761d92c9dd574a6ba36e42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461705,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Angelo Amoroso D'Aragona","original_name":"Angelo Amoroso D'Aragona","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6976289892afc4166fa384bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1937196","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"IOELAMIASEDIA","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/exIgufz93ui6987N2OBxtyHoQ6V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1600,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wSeIL5sAbbSW2aGkCTYaKPQ0L36.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":366396,"name":"puglia"},{"id":366397,"name":"musica popolare"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
