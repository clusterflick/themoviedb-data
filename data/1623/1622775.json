At the abandoned and deserted hotel, they meet the hotel director. He turns out to have carefully planned each person's stay, with his own incentives as the first priority.  The short film is, like the album of the same name, a critique of artist life. The actions in the film symbolize how artists differently experience pressure, discrimination, drugs & alcohol, money & debt and the eternal quest to stay relevant in order to survive as an artist. Symbolized through the hotel “Sorgenfri Inn” and a cynical hotel director.","popularity":0.1071,"poster_path":"/gvLD7sXIqRMJaGJqN2YH19hdT4e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sorgenfri Inn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2057,"iso_3166_1":"NO","iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/gvLD7sXIqRMJaGJqN2YH19hdT4e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
