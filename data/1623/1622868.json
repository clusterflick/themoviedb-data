The goal: To find and sketch from the exact spot where she stood all those years ago under Mont Blanc and make the same sketch in the same spot. Max’s Grandmother (Lu) taught him how to paint when he was young and growing up with Dyslexia, it helped him find his voice through watercolor. But now the only way he can sketch with her again is to find where these sketches were made in a shifting alpine environment. With the help of record setting alpinist and tenacious plant enthusiast Hillary Gerardi, they head in search of the sketches from the top of the Aiguille du Midi to the toe of Mer De Glace. But the lesson they find is far more colorful than any sketchbook could hold.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Under Mont Blanc","title":"My Grandmother’s Sketchbook","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4060906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Romey","original_name":"Max Romey","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697698ff760f7afedcae392c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
