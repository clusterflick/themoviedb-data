The machine rejects her at first, then begins speaking - questioning every selection, taunting her indecision. Rows of teas, coffees, sodas swirl into a maddening maze of “what ifs” as her doubts spiral. Paralyzed by endless options, she withdraws until the machine picks for her. A single drink clatters out, bearing a note: “See you tomorrow.” In its silence, choice paralysis conquers once more.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5960624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chua Wei Jie","original_name":"Chua Wei Jie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697561b30953df167beaee1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5960627,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Aaron Andrew Ang","original_name":"Aaron Andrew Ang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697561caa97f552df8eaedda","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
