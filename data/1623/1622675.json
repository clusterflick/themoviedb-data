Aiming for Switzerland and taking every opportunity to swim, they keep close to rivers and lakes. Their meandering journey leads them into Eastern Europe, meeting musicians and discovering ancestral links between improvisational music and the transmission of folklore in a brave new world dominated by mass media culture. A testimony of August 2011 in Europe and how to recycle songs and cinema history without using the usual maps.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cl6TjPdUKSdKa6fYDwyVqHHpRws.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":287245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moving Animal,
