Volume Seven","overview":"In this production, we take a ride on the Strasburg Railroad and check out the White Mountain Central Railroad's Railfan Days.  We start off at Strasburg Railroad and a trip behind #475 for a trip from East Strasburg to Leaman Place in Paradise. We use our 180º camera and attach it on the rear of the car behind the #475 for the 4 1/2 mile trip to Paradise.  Next, we travel to the White Mountain region of New Hampshire and the White Mountain Central Railroad at Clark's Trading Post. We check out Railfan Days in September to catch all the operating steam locomotives along with non-operable locos as well! We also capture the lone diesel locomotive in action. We capture all the action from both sides of the classic covered bridge and along the line!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wbwARkeTssOiYsEM6yoO0EmBpEt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":247549,"logo_path":"/eCnKVr8rztBWIjB8d1C1TUwnCtP.png","name":"Blackstone River Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shortlines, Tourist Railroads, & Museums: Steam!
