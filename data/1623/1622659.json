Roughly between 1955–1981.\r This period\r was recorded by his father in the manner\r \"I only film what I see in front of the camera\".  And Roman?\r He just grimaced.\r Fishing, engines, spas.  A performance about Mr. Roman's life, recorded on a homemade 8mm film. A total of eight reels of film from an unknown family were part of the film material found during the preparations for the performance EKRAN, and now they are given their space in a separate project called PAN ROMAN.  The screening is accompanied by live music on electronic instruments – an electric organ and a guitar. The project is intended as an apartment event for a limited number of viewers, who complete the event with refreshments brought in, or just by their presence. This creates a vivid reminiscence of apartment culture events in the 1980s.  připravili: Ježek, Freudl, Procházka\r produkce: JedeFrau.org","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rRBDuVlIWq9v8PU0fCvfEkCK0Y9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mr. Roman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2695084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Ježek","original_name":"Martin Ježek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69761f2fddf0ebe1a4694748","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1253,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rRBDuVlIWq9v8PU0fCvfEkCK0Y9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":835},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1070,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2YLC4SHSqNfct5TQI7ETA45bY1Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":713}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
