Italy, at the beginning of the sixties. In a little village in Lucanie, little region in the south, four children live in a situation of absolute poverty, but with their plays in the street succeed in living in happiness. In the air the menace and, in the same time, the hope of a telephonic convocation by their relatives, already at work in coalmines in Belgie, in the mine district of Limburg. Two of our children leave with their families, to reach the numerous Italian community of Flandres. The children will have a lot of problems, in the school and with the language, to integrate in a hostile ambient, but, at the end the will succeed.","popularity":0.3121,"poster_path":"/qJtIPLkUIsBo8CguKB3xzU0YuqZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mineurs","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Mineurs - Minatori e minori","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Nero","original_name":"Franco Nero","popularity":1.2366,"profile_path":"/uiCrTolkOqpZYVxveMZeBx7sjZO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Michele Acucella","credit_id":"55c28f62c3a36842ec000961","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1494106,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Valeria Vaiano","original_name":"Valeria Vaiano","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Vitina Acucella","credit_id":"55c28f8c9251413de5000941","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonino Iuorio","original_name":"Antonino Iuorio","popularity":0.194,"profile_path":"/267gN3jvjC7ljaqjgiiw15xoZ9K.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sagrestano Domenico","credit_id":"55c28fb7c3a36842e900097a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cosimo Fusco","original_name":"Cosimo Fusco","popularity":0.2882,"profile_path":"/uIYyguOSgQ4DNaN8UZkzcHG6dAO.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Rocco Basile","credit_id":"55c28fd79251413ddc00095a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1071365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulderico Pesce","original_name":"Ulderico Pesce","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Maestro Fernando","credit_id":"55c28ff09251413df10008b6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2807702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lennart Lemmens","original_name":"Lennart Lemmens","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/oKOOFmWa9nUwJHnjWyMuVMe59ml.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Rog√©","credit_id":"6654fbeccd01417d345a65c8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1494106,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Valeria Vaiano","original_name":"Valeria Vaiano","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55c28f2b9251413deb000853","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1494106,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Valeria Vaiano","original_name":"Valeria Vaiano","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55c28eb3c3a36842f3000951","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018721,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ugo Lo Pinto","original_name":"Ugo Lo Pinto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55c28ef49251413dee000842","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fulvio Wetzl","original_name":"Fulvio Wetzl","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55c28e9ac3a36842ec000946","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fulvio Wetzl","original_name":"Fulvio Wetzl","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55c28f159251413dee000847","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fulvio Wetzl","original_name":"Fulvio Wetzl","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55c28e8ac3a36842e9000959","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvatore Adamo","original_name":"Salvatore Adamo","popularity":0.1395,"profile_path":"/d5kZfQLFYiC3efGZEjNtGxixsaM.jpg","credit_id":"67cb32bd7c967e04d55b81ed","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1058552","wikidata_id":"Q3428476","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/88hHYvXmYKQzGAyEH6wwEzI7Vbf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1434,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/qJtIPLkUIsBo8CguKB3xzU0YuqZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":956}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
