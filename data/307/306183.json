On the podium was the young conductor Karl Böhm. This opera is a masterpiece of early 20th-century vocal music. Structured in a single act, Daphne is a very consistent work with a rich musical vein. Strauss's orchestration appears, as always, remarkably refined. Vocal writing is demanding for all the main characters, but especially so for the protagonist, here finely interpreted by a magnificent June Anderson.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daphne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2368729","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
