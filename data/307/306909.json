The title was eventually modified in La funivia del Faloria because considered more effective to obtain the governmental prize (at the time the minimum length allowed was 8 minutes). Vertigine was shot in 1949 with the cinematographer Bellisario, who was director of photography in several documentaries in those years, but was edited only in 1950, after Antonioni had made his first feature film, Cronaca di un amore.","popularity":0.1778,"poster_path":"/zICvCf2y0OZbibTl4JrRLQOXu7o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":231242,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documento Mensile","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1950-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Funicular of Mount Faloria","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Vertigine","type":"Recut Version"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Канатная дорога в Фалории","type":"Russian Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Hintermann","original_name":"Carlo Hintermann","popularity":0.1428,"profile_path":"/37wd2HcagkloiswvgqHXN2BqPqY.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"666933b1cbefa8b0f6c82bdc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelangelo Antonioni","original_name":"Michelangelo Antonioni","popularity":0.8047,"profile_path":"/aGrzCeNCEZEI1DhLS8HjWDKNude.jpg","credit_id":"547afe2c925141379900002c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Ferreri","original_name":"Marco Ferreri","popularity":0.1958,"profile_path":"/afP3Hk6ys05jqh33q8nrmkELpZz.jpg","credit_id":"666931dcdaca43f1b6bebdb2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1391607,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Goffredo Bellisario","original_name":"Goffredo Bellisario","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66693220e71034010fbea9d8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049658,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giorgio Prosperi","original_name":"Giorgio Prosperi","popularity":0.169,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6669330f5363573cc68b9241","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":548636,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teo Usuelli","original_name":"Teo Usuelli","popularity":0.1031,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6669335535e03b3ec2f885f8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0042489","wikidata_id":"Q16969214","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7nKaH8eWZan39H8W7SeSBkN22O5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zICvCf2y0OZbibTl4JrRLQOXu7o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":238595,"name":"funicular railway"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"National Museum of Singapore","release_date":"2008-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive","release_date":"2007-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
