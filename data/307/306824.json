The following scenes are fast paced repeated shots from Wonder Woman, with several scenes following of actress Lynda Carter as the main character Diana Prince, performing her transformative spin from secretarial role into superhero role. […] The representation of repeated transformations expose the illusion of fixed female identities in media and attempts to show the emergence of a new woman through use of technology. […] The video ends with a scene of repeating explosions that precedes a blue background with white text that scrolls upwards, delivering a transcription of lyrics to the song ‘Wonder Woman Disco'.","popularity":0.6001,"poster_path":"/9kfWX5axn279TBI1DxTCs9abX0j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1978-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynda Carter","original_name":"Lynda Carter","popularity":1.4553,"profile_path":"/m4PnYu6TbYyMeJah3xApvPSM3UY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Wonder Woman (Archive Footage)","credit_id":"5739c7659251417d3f00031b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208055,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"The Wonderland Disco Band","original_name":"The Wonderland Disco Band","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d53951f14dad01004a87d2","department":"Sound","job":"Songs"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1391357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dara Birnbaum","original_name":"Dara Birnbaum","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"547a383dc3a3685c480030a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0413351","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nqIbwbtlZYxjrWF04YtzmpzKrRq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9kfWX5axn279TBI1DxTCs9abX0j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":676}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
