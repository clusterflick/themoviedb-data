Whereas all villagers have been evacuated, stoic old Jacoba refuses to vacate her little house on the dyke. Filled with a longing for death, she sits and waits for the dykes to give way. She kills time by listening to the radio alerts, by reading the Bible and by praying to God to hurry up. Until she is disturbed by the arrival of her 12-year-old granddaughter Fleur, who foils her plan. Gradually, the film unravels the reason for the old woman's peculiar behaviour, at the bottom of which lie indigestable past events. Despite attempts to get rid of Fleur, the unyielding girl is determined not to abandon her grandma. The confrontation with her grandchild forces the elderly lady to reconsider her intention.","popularity":0.1496,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7112,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waterland Film","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2003-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Novemberlight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1066132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annemarie Prins","original_name":"Annemarie Prins","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":"/drvq9XXPEgXdip0IRVDjkNnlJs4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"547654819251416136000568","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1344200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niek Pancras","original_name":"Niek Pancras","popularity":0.1291,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"547654899251413bff0002dd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva van Barneveld","original_name":"Eva van Barneveld","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"54765493c3a3680844000c40","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Ferwerda","original_name":"Patrick Ferwerda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5476549c92514151af000dee","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":27830,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Helena van der Meulen","original_name":"Helena van der Meulen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5476544ec3a368764e0020c9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389771,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pauline Mol","original_name":"Pauline Mol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5476545ec3a3680844000c34","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Oosthoek","original_name":"Eric Oosthoek","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5476544392514152730038a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0353817","wikidata_id":"Q1870724","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
