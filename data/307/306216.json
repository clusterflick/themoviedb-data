Filmmaker/stonemason. A tower or ruin of remembrance. With each swing of the hammer I cut into the image and the sound rises from the chisel. A rhythm, marked by repetition, and animated by variation; strokes of hammer and fist, resounding in dialogue. In this space which the film creates, emptiness gains a contour strong enough for the spectator to see more than the image â€“ a space permitting vision in addition to sight.","popularity":0.1527,"poster_path":"/kxhsIbHgEZHfDUkZ2CD5txa64U9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2001-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ground","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"547511c692514144d5000d2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"5a5e11000e0a267f5500bb17","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"5a5e10f7c3a3686a6400af23","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2359359","wikidata_id":"Q114855782","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9WJbHKVeFIhG9WkhZz6HrM3selH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ua69eaZXcG8tuZtMPRGzUQyIaq3.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kxhsIbHgEZHfDUkZ2CD5txa64U9.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eWy8OUgYQJ61lP2iEa2QLHwQrpM.jpg","vote_average":0.958,"vote_count":4,"width":852},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/67JMllC785g37I6FpCcb4XinMKM.jpg","vote_average":0.5,"vote_count":4,"width":852}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":220944,"name":"stonecutter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Toronto Film Festival","release_date":"2003-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2001-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"2001-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
