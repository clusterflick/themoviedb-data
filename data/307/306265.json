In the age of cut-down high tops and late shove-its, the hellish Plan B roster (brought together by a visionary Mike Ternasky) rose above the transitional feel of the era by pioneering today's tech + handrail methodologies.  Shot lovingly with shouldered VHS dinosaurs and screw-on fisheyes, Questionable is an undoubtedly raw, homegrown, and pure skateboarding video that not only reflects a major turning point in skateboarding's evolution, but illuminates the path that the sport will follow over the next decade.","popularity":0.1848,"poster_path":"/909fPN8OV3eqDy9fkxyXk7EzCcX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plan B
