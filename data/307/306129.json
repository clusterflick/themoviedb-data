Dinanath Chopra lives in a small tenement with his wife, and two sons Baldev, and Chandramohan. Dinanath re-finances his house in order to get Baldev to study further and be a doctor, and also gets him married with Rekha who comes from a very wealthy family. Chandramohan studies in college, and has a sweetheart in the form of the gorgeous Asha. Asha lives with her mom, and dad, a sort of quack. Differences in the Baldev emerge and multiply. Baldev and Rekha move to their palatial house. The birth of a baby boy to Rekha does lighten things up a bit, but not for long. Dinanath loses his eyesight in an accident and becomes blind.","popularity":0.313,"poster_path":"/ykOHPehDvvu4HZ32iQE9YxU2lah.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aap Ki Parchhaiyan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dharmendra","original_name":"Dharmendra","popularity":0.7866,"profile_path":"/qRT0nOpxt14osa76nTrNduawX0l.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Chandramohan (Channi) Chopra","credit_id":"58d8545c9251411f89060478","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":128710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Supriya Choudhury","original_name":"Supriya Choudhury","popularity":0.2954,"profile_path":"/iKcZORvDOePO97oxJq0BztgYZXM.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Asha","credit_id":"58d85468925141445f014803","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shashikala","original_name":"Shashikala","popularity":0.1833,"profile_path":"/LPnVjkmLPZkwgzX8Uc4gS1a2d5.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Rekha","credit_id":"58d854799251411fd505fc32","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leela Chitnis","original_name":"Leela Chitnis","popularity":0.128,"profile_path":"/gXCc0E6K9ZT4SeJ1d7G57lCPWcl.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mrs. Dinanath Chopra","credit_id":"58d8552e9251411f890604f7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":639461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mumtaz Begum","original_name":"Mumtaz Begum","popularity":0.1868,"profile_path":"/lbzmD4putTxLLaXfWiyh2HBCTAH.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Rekha's mother","credit_id":"58d8554b9251411f9005fd95","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":600251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Om Prakash","original_name":"Om Prakash","popularity":0.2357,"profile_path":"/5yUA7sreaD2xYLSvEwpSADJ2M1Y.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Vilayti Ram","credit_id":"58d8555ac3a368128905f68a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1325553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manorama","original_name":"Manorama","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":"/ctIm9goucENifJ2O7FqNP8D5mYR.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Mrs. Vilayti Ram","credit_id":"58d85584925141448e015449","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moolchand","original_name":"Moolchand","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/o4PbKAsfmAQ2PP6r3wI4oaiho4C.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Lala Khushiram","credit_id":"58d855adc3a368124f05d30d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1032625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harbans Darshan M.
