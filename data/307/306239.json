After a twenty year hiatus, The Call reunited at legendary Los Angeles venue The Troubadour and gave an incredible live performance with Robert Levon Been stepping into his father's role and joining Musick, Ferrier and Goodwin for the one-of-a-kind event. For Robert--who grew up going out on the road with The Call anytime he had a break from school--the performance offered the chance to honor his musical legacy and perform nearly a dozen and a half songs from the band's esteemed catalog. And for original members Musick, Ferrier and Goodwin, the show allowed them the opportunity to honor their friend and their own musical legacy while revisiting a bond they thought was gone forever.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tribute To Michael Been","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
