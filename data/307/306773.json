She finds employment as a maid for a nasty woman, who seems to be in a persistently vengeful mood and showers her with verbal and physical abuse. Rather coincidentally, Ainiâ€™s boyfriend Ramlan (Ali Rahman) happens to be the brother-in-law of the abusive employer. Aini confides her sorrows to Ramlan, who clearly identifies with her grim view of life, being unemployed and in a pretty forlorn state himself. Nonetheless, Ramlan is from a middle-class background  and his proposal to marry Aini, who is considered socially inferior, is met with outright disapproval.","popularity":0.0748,"poster_path":"/puJNG2tRE6IHHNXk68dTQcYKzRh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malay Film Productions Ltd.","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"1953-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hati Iblis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali Rahman","original_name":"Ali Rahman","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56316280c3a3681b4d01264c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aini Hayati","original_name":"Aini Hayati","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56316292c3a3681b590106ef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dato' Haji Jamil Sulong","original_name":"Dato' Haji Jamil Sulong","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"563162a4c3a3681b4b00fb28","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daeng Idris","original_name":"Daeng Idris","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"563162fc9251413b460031e3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aini Jasmin","original_name":"Aini Jasmin","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5631630c9251413b460031e7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"K.
