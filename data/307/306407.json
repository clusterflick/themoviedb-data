He has brought up his three younger brothers, Shyam (Kanu Chauhan), Sohan (Jeetendra), and Mohan (Rishi Kapoor), with love and fatherly care, together with his wife, Sita (Asha Parekh). Sita has a younger sister, Gita (Juhi Chawla), who also lives with them. Gita is a child-widow. Ram does not approve of anyone referring to Gita as such. Ram decides that it is time for Shyam and Sohan to get married, and he picks their brides for them. Shyam marries Mona, and Sohan marries Sheela (Anita Raj). With the entry of these two new wives, the equilibrium of love and respect is disrupted, as both want more control and demand more respect, which leads to clashes and quarrels all round, and changes in the lives of all the inhabitants. Eventually, in the end, everyone lives happily together and Mohan and Gita get married.","popularity":0.4136,"poster_path":"/n0c0gS406uj8P6Mz6hCxDLjzw6V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1994-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghar Ki Izzat","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juhi Chawla Mehta","original_name":"Juhi Chawla Mehta","popularity":0.7349,"profile_path":"/gyZLscSW3dYYe3N5K2YcYtRnbq5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Geeta","credit_id":"64460227764841047cbe1db4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rishi Kapoor","original_name":"Rishi Kapoor","popularity":0.6306,"profile_path":"/yQOKkmQaksa3hOi72MbPnrqz77k.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mohan Kumar","credit_id":"6446023fc8f3c4067b44b677","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kader Khan","original_name":"Kader Khan","popularity":0.9435,"profile_path":"/gf0v2N4xKNGDfHN5lxk7yxUEYQ3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ram Kumar","credit_id":"64460272058224498d32c626","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1035281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asha Parekh","original_name":"Asha Parekh","popularity":0.3341,"profile_path":"/p9AdJWhZNL7v7yWlduykcE7EiAj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Seeta","credit_id":"644602857648410840bea4e6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":616995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeetendra","original_name":"Jeetendra","popularity":0.3196,"profile_path":"/i1D38TUK4JynQHq0hgihFkD61ba.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Sohan Kumar","credit_id":"644602b0764841047cbe1e14","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4025747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kalptaru","original_name":"Kalptaru","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644601c3c8f3c404f344b469","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0172488","wikidata_id":"Q21869371","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n0c0gS406uj8P6Mz6hCxDLjzw6V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"1994-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
