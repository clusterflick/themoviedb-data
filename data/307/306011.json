The credit sequence in which title cards show successively larger foetuses pulsating on the screen until the baby is born and cries.  2.) Etoile-directly referring to Cocteau, Lethem shows an adolescent sucking a starfish and then giving birth to a smaller starfish. A statement of inadequacy. To give birth involves an emasculation and a loss of vitality.  3.) Corps-two images of a man on a couch groping for each other, watched by a mysterious peeping Tom. As the two superimposed images come together, the heavy breathing subsides…the statement that the birth of desire is a self – realisation.  4.) Hymen – The decaying body of a girl is shot through green filters, and the final image reveals her vagina crawling with maggots and overlain with a crucifix. A representation of Catholicism preventing the free expression of desire.","popularity":0.3375,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sufferings of a Wounded Egg","video":false,"vote_average":3.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrée McLey","original_name":"Andrée McLey","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5474901cc3a36875de001af8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roland Lespineux","original_name":"Roland Lespineux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5474902892514179ee0005ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":104225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jio Berk","original_name":"Jio Berk","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54749031c3a3686bf3000283","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1365918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Duport","original_name":"Nicole Duport","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5474907292514179ee0005c4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Lethem","original_name":"Roland Lethem","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/1JpCtomjsI8wr9twqYYm5ccZi5p.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"547490acc3a3686bf300028e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Lethem","original_name":"Roland Lethem","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/1JpCtomjsI8wr9twqYYm5ccZi5p.jpg","credit_id":"5474900a9251413981001d3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0832363","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3032,"name":"suffering"},{"id":1690,"name":"belgium"},{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Knokke Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"1967-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
