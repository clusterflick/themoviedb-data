Starting with the remix of the classic album Jailbreak by Scott Gorham and Brian Downie, the film takes us through the rollercoaster ride that is the story of Thin Lizzy.  From early footage of singer Phil Lynott in Ireland in his pre-Lizzy bands the Black Eagles and Orphanage, it follows his progress as he, guitarist Eric Bell and drummer Brian Downie form the basic three-piece that was to become Thin Lizzy - a name taken from the Beano.  Using original interviews with Bell, Downie, the man who signed them and their first manager, it traces the early years leading to the recruitment of guitarists Brian 'Robbo' Robertson and Scott Gorham - the classic line-up.  The film uses a number of stills, some seen on TV for the first time, archive from contemporary TV shows and a range of tracks both well known and not so famous.","popularity":0.2782,"poster_path":"/qakfPpirsO8TB2moQyP4TyZtHGq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thin Lizzy: Bad Reputation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Lynott","original_name":"Phil Lynott","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/7ciNbQkH4nZaJzLf6qiuUJT8JpP.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"595979569251410bfa02ca73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Bell","original_name":"Eric Bell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/bYGjFtQ7s4Nfa0xtAqZtp8ARkKg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d5038052716710015f71112","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Downey","original_name":"Brian Downey","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/hRWacE6J0lhQ5PhV4q6tM4Iu9MK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d5039fe2716710012f70f2d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Moore","original_name":"Gary Moore","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/fIwBJYdsvx7e2yJsUds32gAYyrp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d5035db41eee136e60e2006","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Gorham","original_name":"Scott Gorham","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/gJc4GkTQZ7q5abDL1117Cs6Mw2K.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d5036e47c6de37689a79d6b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Robertson","original_name":"Brian Robertson","popularity":0.1202,"profile_path":"/mDEmCxCsBSAqV3IWPRPqbO3CMXB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d5035e841eee127730ebc08","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Brusasco","original_name":"Linda Brusasco","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d503a97079a970b9eae91c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Brusasco","original_name":"Linda Brusasco","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d503aa4079a9754d2add3da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2384613,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hamish Barbour","original_name":"Hamish Barbour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d503abd7c6de31dd6a60e16","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1823951","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":2141,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qakfPpirsO8TB2moQyP4TyZtHGq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":578,"name":"rock 'n' roll"},{"id":14985,"name":"ireland"},{"id":18002,"name":"hard rock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
