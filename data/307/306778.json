The main headline of the 2013 GAA Football Championship will be Dublin raising Sam for the second time in 3 years. Under new manager, Jim Gavin, the Dubs had an outstanding ‘triple crown’ year as they also won the National League and retained their Leinster title. That might read like it was a championship that went as expected without drama and excitement but nothing could be further from the truth. It was, in fact, one of the most memorable championships in years, producing some of the best fare and more than its share of shocks and surprises.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":330,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sam 2013","title":"GAA Football Championship 2013","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
