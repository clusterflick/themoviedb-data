While basking in his celebrity at a nighttime carnival, Froelich romances Rose Stradner, the unhappy wife of brutish Heinrich George. When George refuses to give Stradner her freedom, she takes it anyway, but her fling with Froelich is doomed to disappointment. Our hero learns the hard way that one can be in a teeming crowd, yet still be all alone. Leading lady Stradner later resettled in Hollywood, where she appeared in such films as The Last Gangster and Keys to the Kingdom.","popularity":0.3734,"poster_path":"/iFWzgjJ2YhBexsN3DgFQuEPKYs8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134662,"logo_path":null,"name":"Otzoup-Film","origin_country":""},{"id":1227,"logo_path":null,"name":"Itala Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1935-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Night of Change","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Demaskierung","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustav Fröhlich","original_name":"Gustav Fröhlich","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/bkjDaorTT3LcOeTcQF1TDpBlHwt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Frank Cornelius","credit_id":"54765bf492514160e3004b30","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinrich George","original_name":"Heinrich George","popularity":0.157,"profile_path":"/pG7HbJEVnG44wOL1kgaeTVZbzL7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Boris Pettkoff","credit_id":"54765c0bc3a368364c00403a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Gülstorff","original_name":"Max Gülstorff","popularity":0.1498,"profile_path":"/kgPJTUxxuDSzF1kdGz0JMMMcY86.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Philippe de Brissac, Senator","credit_id":"54765c28c3a368764e0021d2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Stradner","original_name":"Rose Stradner","popularity":0.1553,"profile_path":"/wmhCdhrdltgLqfEhEwNMvg9J1m2.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Maria, seine Frau","credit_id":"66892665a9ca9fc190cb719a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Frank","original_name":"Ellen Frank","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":"/eX8DSySCkMx0gOLGXxJHaDhh7nc.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Fräulein Neville","credit_id":"668926723a2689744ea3945c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrud Wolle","original_name":"Gertrud Wolle","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/J5qeSqn6SH8dD3XMRpHlJXngES.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Amélie, seine Frau","credit_id":"66892681441df895a249a07a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Hardt","original_name":"Harry Hardt","popularity":0.2065,"profile_path":"/dT95hFksf12JqpEydgTKc7t1COW.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Kommissar Nicole","credit_id":"6689268f7da9d657edd50173","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"F.
