It's called \"mass extinction,\" and it's happened at least five times before. Cataclysms, such as supervolcanoes or asteroids, are thought to cause these events, but some experts believe a manmade mass extinction could be next. Is our planet in trouble? And if so, is there anything we can do to stop the next catastrophic annihilation? Experts are traveling the world, performing groundbreaking scientific detective work to answer these very questions.","popularity":1.0989,"poster_path":"/se4j1QQfPTXg38UPFBnhX4M0dDP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83714,"logo_path":"/v8EoMrSFyvXtChtJXHn2tobgrmL.png","name":"Tangled Bank Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":18894,"logo_path":"/rFr30k0B8DgdZtPHjzAtQIJ3XDH.png","name":"Smithsonian Channel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The clues to the future lie in the past","title":"Mass Extinction: Life at the Brink","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1713685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Hadly","original_name":"Elizabeth Hadly","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/sKOk4zJggDvM6yztIQWVtS6Ew2j.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5837624d9251413192018d9c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Wright","original_name":"Jeffrey Wright","popularity":1.6811,"profile_path":"/yGcuHGW4glqRpOPxgiCvjcren7F.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"583763e1925141319801776b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3989723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirk Johnson","original_name":"Kirk Johnson","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64288502c5840d00b61e6103","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1223307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Holt","original_name":"Sarah Holt","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583762fcc3a368247d01312a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":105618,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tom Friedman","original_name":"Tom Friedman","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583762bbc3a36836a60196c0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1223307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Holt","original_name":"Sarah Holt","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583762f39251414cb900aed2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38801,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Rosenfeld","original_name":"Michael Rosenfeld","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583762a792514131980176ae","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1223307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Holt","original_name":"Sarah Holt","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583762e592514131a10168d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713686,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sean B.
