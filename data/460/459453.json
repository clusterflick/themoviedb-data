A female fantastic (Alexandra Gelis) knitting on the fly (subways, bankomats, beaches) and making audio recordings provides a throughline of sorts, as queer marriages give way to videogame palm trees, warm gatherings of friends are interwoven with public noticings, workers mostly, street hawkers and construction zones of the self. These lyrical interludes (in this movie the in-between is at the heart of the matter) are punctuated by rescanned YouTube interviews with authors/philosophers/scientists Jorge Luis Borges, Francisco Varela, Julio Cortazar, Beatriz Preciado and Gilles Deleuze. They muse briefly on creativity, exile, the biopolitics of the birth control pill, and the necessity of making mistakes in philosophy.","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":"/iJKWVyB8nV93wRTHJdjaZ57ZW2c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90887,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scriptless Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stratigraphies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Gelis","original_name":"Alexandra Gelis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592aff3b9251413b45064e1a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Lozano","original_name":"Jorge Lozano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592aff28c3a36877ee064579","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Lozano","original_name":"Jorge Lozano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594a0af6c3a36861b5007dd7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iJKWVyB8nV93wRTHJdjaZ57ZW2c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
