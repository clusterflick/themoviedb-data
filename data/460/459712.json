Filmed in the barrios of east LA and in the prisons of California, this real-life drama follows the making of the Hollywood feature film American Me, in which director Edward James Olmos used real gang members and prison inmates as actors. The fictional scenes these homeboys portray pale in juxtaposition to the stark reality of their daily lives, a world where opportunities are scarce and guns plentiful. The brutal honesty of these gang members as they struggle to change makes Lives in Hazard a powerful story of kids caught up in a growing national crisis.","popularity":0.5782,"poster_path":"/5rQDSb0TojgTzYRdGv3bSXeKd37.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8847,"logo_path":null,"name":"Olmos Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":88365,"logo_path":null,"name":"Archipelago Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lives in Hazard","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domingo Abriz","original_name":"Domingo Abriz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"638afc7815376c00834b0f6a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"M.C.
