Wanted for murder, Clay Webley (Warren Stevens) and his wounded cellmate Curtis Parker (Robert Cunningham) hack their way through the Florida swampland. With the help of Clay's brother Dan (Steve Cochran), Clay is able to elude the authorities, but Parker dies of a snakebite. Subsisting on alligator meat, Dan and Clay make their way to the tiny cabin inhabited by widowed Jane Daughterty (Carole Mathews), her mother-in-law, and her son Johnny (Spencer Fox). The brothers rest here awhile, formulating plans to cross the Gulf of Mexico and head for Cuba.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wqxpZXAZY65obCTeYFF99WqZsrM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60,"logo_path":"/4YldLvCWQL9VIAHQ2Fu3Ffkh9Si.png","name":"United Artists","origin_country":"US"},{"id":90922,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Rawlins Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THEY EAT 'EM ALIVE IN Shark River","title":"Shark River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Cochran","original_name":"Steve Cochran","popularity":0.3096,"profile_path":"/pQu49oRFMm1iDvQfAHsbw3mzRQG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dan Webley","credit_id":"592c61a29251413ba0071013","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carole Mathews","original_name":"Carole Mathews","popularity":0.1977,"profile_path":"/3f5ZDqj1pqoCyQ3cME0FYO6gdDA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jane Daughterty","credit_id":"592c61ad9251413b5b07a873","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warren Stevens","original_name":"Warren Stevens","popularity":0.6071,"profile_path":"/tq3EULJdG5G9dHnsQp4zFi2Jugt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Clay Webley","credit_id":"592c61bc9251413b5b07a88a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Foreman","original_name":"Ruth Foreman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Daughterty","credit_id":"592c61d89251413ba0071057","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spencer Fox","original_name":"Spencer Fox","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Johnny Daughterty","credit_id":"592c61e99251413b410783f8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Piper","original_name":"Bill Piper","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"592c61f7c3a368783e079330","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Cunningham","original_name":"Robert Cunningham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Curtis Parker","credit_id":"592c62229251413ba00710ac","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Rawlins","original_name":"John Rawlins","popularity":0.1844,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592c61799251413b54074ae9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Rawlins","original_name":"John Rawlins","popularity":0.1844,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592c617ec3a368782d072229","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187946,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Louis Lantz","original_name":"Louis Lantz","popularity":0.1641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592c61889251413b4507ac6e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7336,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lewis Meltzer","original_name":"Lewis Meltzer","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/7rw92zcYqzGiPhFIvWidto8VJ0U.jpg","credit_id":"592c61939251413b54074b01","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0046305","wikidata_id":"Q13417079","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m7IfO6UY70Vn14ELzh0WjmuArfc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":888,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nOxqs3JhSfabikw0Q6YeAHj7ogw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1578}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":2696,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wqxpZXAZY65obCTeYFF99WqZsrM.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1830},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lHmjYTdN87ZQTy9ArwlHPH45DNt.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":701,"name":"cuba"},{"id":3186,"name":"everglades"},{"id":4551,"name":"swamp"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1953-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
