From 1967 to 1970, the hippie revolution gave us great anthems, great events, great sex and great big afghan coats.  The music was by The Doors; queen of the hippies Joni Mitchell; and the world was set alight by the number 1 hit Fire by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown.  Hippies dropped out at the biggest festival, Woodstock, and were turned on by LSD and free love.  The whole experience was literally set on film by Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda in Easy Rider while the hippest of all looked East and followed in the trail of the Beatles to India.","popularity":0.943,"poster_path":"/i3txQr3F2hmF9kkWmAV4LjOzDxN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Hippies Ruled The World","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Hopper","original_name":"Dennis Hopper","popularity":1.2061,"profile_path":"/kqyNvLHi5RZGZcZMxl7e6XvoB5U.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"592e878692514130d2009c39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Manzarek","original_name":"Ray Manzarek","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":"/AUZj0TkG88XAIRZuBF4JllLcE6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"592e879092514130de009c93","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joni Mitchell","original_name":"Joni Mitchell","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/NSdryvQJs9GfCgnEFRsSXp2bP3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"592e87c3c3a3686135009754","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Brown","original_name":"Arthur Brown","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":"/pbDHIrCeYwcYyZc8IM8wCIMN5fr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"592e87fbc3a368614300967b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":215818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Peel","original_name":"John Peel","popularity":0.3019,"profile_path":"/o1piv4P3TNObX7Hr34jbxANr62I.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"592e884bc3a3686157009462","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Clarkson","original_name":"Jeremy Clarkson","popularity":0.8334,"profile_path":"/8tnYaTYfbSzmGyHeEeBCoNUzCdZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67574ad798c33892a255a05e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ice-T","original_name":"Ice-T","popularity":1.4086,"profile_path":"/96TdPckI16ggfHcPrSFf6bHYLLe.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67574adfce47f20900516877","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4074960","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i3txQr3F2hmF9kkWmAV4LjOzDxN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
