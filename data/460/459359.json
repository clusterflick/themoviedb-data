Changing light, reflections, moving shadows, and the undulating surface of the water dominate the film; images alternate between panoramic views of the port with its industrial plants and ships and close-up shots of bollards, quays, and individual parts of buildings. The calm images and the silence (the film lacks sound) convey a peaceful atmosphere that contrasts with the usually noisy industrial harbor.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qnButRFErHAblw2zkAmJWFx6oso.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"X/78 Rheinhafen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1824907,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","original_name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/z0HvKg68ujOW6NC0N17gln4eY8h.jpg","credit_id":"592a127fc3a368782d04fb9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1824907,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","original_name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/z0HvKg68ujOW6NC0N17gln4eY8h.jpg","credit_id":"592a128ac3a368787004e2a3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qnButRFErHAblw2zkAmJWFx6oso.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
