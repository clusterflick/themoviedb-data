He begins with a 1987 US state department document invalidating US passports for travel to Lebanon. Then, we see walls marked by bullet holes, film students listening to a lecture and practicing scenes in a restaurant. Next, the camera visits a mental hospital in Fanar and an older man, holding his Koran, laments being a refugee within his own country. The camera then enters a nursery school. The colors of poetry are red and green; the cost of being Lebanese is to orphan one's children in order then to adopt them.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/1aTCZL7UzWERZz22PgadZajKM6k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Credits Included: A Video In Red And Green","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1013860,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Zorn","original_name":"John Zorn","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/ob7GSs2RWomOzFgrK0o8e2jOxAJ.jpg","credit_id":"63d62ef312b10e00851c01d7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1823979,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jalal Toufic","original_name":"Jalal Toufic","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592841ff9251413b8a03a5e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1823979,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jalal Toufic","original_name":"Jalal Toufic","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592841f89251413b5b03c5e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0239317","wikidata_id":"Q123287754","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1aTCZL7UzWERZz22PgadZajKM6k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"1995-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
