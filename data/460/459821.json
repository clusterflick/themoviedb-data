Using a variety of news footage, as well as archival footage shot by Abassâ€™ sister, a cellist in the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra, the film demonstrates how in 2003, the US administration, engaged in a gesture of propagandist spectacle. Instead of supporting the orchestra in reestablishing itself after the war, the U.S. saw it more beneficial to militarily airlift the musicians to Washington so they could perform one evening at the Kennedy Centre before President Bush, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and other top ranking politicians. Presented at the Iraqi Pavilion at the 57th Venice Biennale.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Music of the Bush Era","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sherko Abbas","original_name":"Sherko Abbas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592dfd8292514130da000a51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
