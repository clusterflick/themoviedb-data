Through a personal trip down memory lane, visiting the places that moulded her, we learn what happens when the city changes and leaves those who built it behind. Travelling through Bermondsey, Rotherhithe, Elephant & Castle, Walworth Road, Peckham, Brixton and of course Shoreditch, 'Denim' is both a personal tale and a wider social commentary.","popularity":0.2426,"poster_path":"/pNGT7ohNDTNHb20oW3raxhr7n2U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Denim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maya Bangura","original_name":"Maya Bangura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Younger Siana","credit_id":"592ea6cec3a368611b00ac1b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Siana Bangura","original_name":"Siana Bangura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592ea70492514130de00bb1e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Siana Bangura","original_name":"Siana Bangura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592ea70cc3a36860b900bc1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Siana Bangura","original_name":"Siana Bangura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592ea71f92514130e300ba83","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826416,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Susuana Amoah","original_name":"Susuana Amoah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592ea73bc3a368616a00ae34","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826416,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Susuana Amoah","original_name":"Susuana Amoah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592ea75fc3a368615700b0ec","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826418,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nia Ekanem","original_name":"Nia Ekanem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592ea79b925141312000bdd4","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826462,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Fletch","original_name":"Alex Fletch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592eb1a2c3a36860b900c54c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pNGT7ohNDTNHb20oW3raxhr7n2U.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1016}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":212,"name":"london, england"},{"id":496,"name":"poetry"},{"id":163082,"name":"gentrification"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
