In a set of tour-de-force probes into the images and essences of such downtown luminaries as Richard Foreman, Ken Jacobs, and Carolee Schneemann, Hills’s cinematic inventions literally turn the screen upside down and inside out. In this epic journey into the picaresque, we follow Emma Bee Bernstein, our intrepid protagonist, from her pre-teen innocence to her late teen-attitude, as she learns about the downtown art scene firsthand. In the process, Hills reimagines the art of video in a style that achieves the density, complexity, and visual richness of his greatest films.","popularity":0.1063,"poster_path":"/zc2C8kU3Z7f6emoz0ztchiWCKxe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emma's Dilemma","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Bee Bernstein","original_name":"Emma Bee Bernstein","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e4a38b52d93750019aa691c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolee Schneemann","original_name":"Carolee Schneemann","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/1J4OvAVVJpgI3NzLSAzn2WQBYTN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e4a39411e9225001ac3fe0f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Mac Low","original_name":"Jackson Mac Low","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e4a395e35811d0013496357","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Jacobs","original_name":"Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/lLWmlUKswUHhW6TEHD4i56xleke.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e4a398d35811d00134963ca","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1667245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cheryl Donegan","original_name":"Cheryl Donegan","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/ooo1r68pk6I8f400juj6KAEr48n.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e4a39d335811d0013496557","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keith Sanborn","original_name":"Keith Sanborn","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e4a39fb1e9225001ac40009","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Hills","original_name":"Henry Hills","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/iZiYZwSxVB7Ic3xBdl2mOCG1F2W.jpg","credit_id":"5e4a37ef9b861600166356e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.744,"height":829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zc2C8kU3Z7f6emoz0ztchiWCKxe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":617}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
