In 1973, as a dire oil crisis plagued the country, Carson made a joke on \"The Tonight Show\" about a possible paper shortage. This off-hand remark quickly created an actual paper shortage when viewers went and bought up as much toilet paper as they could get their hands on. Compiled entirely of archival footage, and animated sequences based on contemporaneous news reports, the film explores the power and impact of misinformation in the media.","popularity":0.1709,"poster_path":"/a8UWdyCWoZq5HLQbwrTyEWT6YB9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Toilet Paper Scare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867355,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Gersten","original_name":"Brian Gersten","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Various Voices","credit_id":"5e4a4a7c9b86160018637d48","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541433,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arlin Golden","original_name":"Arlin Golden","popularity":0.2885,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Various Voices","credit_id":"5e4a4a879b86160013634cd3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernadette McVerry","original_name":"Bernadette McVerry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Various Voices","credit_id":"5e4a4a939b86160018637d82","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Carson","original_name":"Johnny Carson","popularity":0.4675,"profile_path":"/sSltRe7S82Zw29lMRGLeEoL2PUu.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e4a4b6535811d001549a89c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867355,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Gersten","original_name":"Brian Gersten","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a4aa72d93750015a98fcb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867355,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Gersten","original_name":"Brian Gersten","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a4ab22d93750019aa8e12","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383831,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Joe Presser","original_name":"Joe Presser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a4abe1e92250015c3be64","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541433,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arlin Golden","original_name":"Arlin Golden","popularity":0.2885,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a4ac835811d001549a624","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/a8UWdyCWoZq5HLQbwrTyEWT6YB9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
