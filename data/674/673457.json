Saudi filmmaker Fahmi Farahat takes his camera and invites us into his own life in an attempt to answer these questions. He captures the views and attitudes of his family and friends, who are either living or visiting the US, through which he explores the many issues that surround Saudis in America.  The film is Producer by Ahmad Zahra and Executive Produced by Mohannad Malas. Other credits include Director of Photography John Taylor and Music Composer Vicente Avella who starts the opening sequence of the film with his own rendition of the Star Spangled Banner, a fusion of Arabic and Western style music. The film also features the song My Favorite Passages by Ani from her Album \"One\".","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/hZ6oJ1HzX5mseyM4w8aEPclr0YC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94394,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zahra Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saudis in America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3721053,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amer Malas","original_name":"Amer Malas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633612bb255dba007c7c5a32","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1880276,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ahmad Zahra","original_name":"Ahmad Zahra","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/8x9ULGBXg0sJ0qUwIDkJQvALDKS.jpg","credit_id":"633612c3255dba007c7c5a36","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1880280,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mohannad Malas","original_name":"Mohannad Malas","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633612cbf3b49a007b81470e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1783927,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vicente Avella","original_name":"Vicente Avella","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zG8urdtsEpjob97KFZGTRcsBcoq.jpg","credit_id":"633612d307faa20098dbc25d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1880278,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fahmi Farahat","original_name":"Fahmi Farahat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/uyW9bRgJeUvZaigFJPkhQ4GQIsW.jpg","credit_id":"63361346b076e5007b2570b4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1880278,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fahmi Farahat","original_name":"Fahmi Farahat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/uyW9bRgJeUvZaigFJPkhQ4GQIsW.jpg","credit_id":"5e4948ae9b8616001361cea4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hZ6oJ1HzX5mseyM4w8aEPclr0YC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gulf Film Festival","release_date":"2008-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
