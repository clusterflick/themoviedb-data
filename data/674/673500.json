Indeed, the management, which can no longer afford the establishment, is preparing to sell the store to a large distribution group. Agathe, a saleswoman in the men's department for more than 25 years, is shocked to discover that all the staff will be laid off. Feeling both betrayed and responsible for the future of the \"Grand Magasin\", she becomes a passionaria, leading her colleagues to revolt, a true leader. The operation finally seems to bear fruit when the sale is cancelled and a new director is appointed.","popularity":0.4444,"poster_path":"/iVRdorhgAjtV3u9hRVKKtIPDnUJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2001-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Agathe et le grand magasin","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miou-Miou","original_name":"Miou-Miou","popularity":0.3525,"profile_path":"/kjQD9nNjcakYxOmXq1IG66y1RtU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Agathe","credit_id":"5e4971051e9225001ac2aba7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Cassignard","original_name":"Pierre Cassignard","popularity":0.1712,"profile_path":"/ltQbINZNlCbB5fCLrLAbBIn7mtr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Deboz","credit_id":"5e4971159b86160011620d5d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2540693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Baehr","original_name":"Catherine Baehr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Paule","credit_id":"5e49712635811d001748968d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Louis Richard","original_name":"Jean-Louis Richard","popularity":0.2226,"profile_path":"/pT0vIOIESVdy1AincoVJowRksRI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"M.
