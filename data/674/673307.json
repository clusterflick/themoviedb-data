In his immersive documentary debut, Mischa Richter, whose artist family has been living in Provincetown for nearly a century, explores his home through shared moments and conversations with locals, pilgrims, outcasts, fishermen, drag queens and spirit guides in an exploration of what freedom and community mean in America today.","popularity":0.318,"poster_path":"/Ah8I0t07LmMaDlEJQJvkXZlWKxv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98506,"logo_path":null,"name":"Under the Influence
