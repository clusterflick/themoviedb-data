The video documents a boy and a girl who slowly approach out of the darkness and into the light. Shown on separate screens, they break through what is, at first, an invisible threshold of water, suggestive of a passage from the spiritual world into a physical plane of existence. Once incarnate, however, all beings realize that their presence is finite, and so the figures eventually turn away from material existence to return from whence they came.","popularity":0.0952,"poster_path":"/ooxkNNLupftaboyaG7eo1omPjJx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Innocents","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Viola","original_name":"Bill Viola","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/qvXzhdfBNfL7RVaqtmw9STYvUAu.jpg","credit_id":"5e482e511e92250018c04dd9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ooxkNNLupftaboyaG7eo1omPjJx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
