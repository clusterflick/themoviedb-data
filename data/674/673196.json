He tells the story, then the development of what was originally intended to be a short documentary film and which turned into an unusual allegory. Composed of fascinating archives, including notably the correspondence between Duras and Resnais, this analysis of 'Hiroshima mon amour' manages to put the film in perspective while detaching itself from it. A rare and captivating work.","popularity":0.1272,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":113973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciné Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":86197,"logo_path":"/gUTZ1JDzJOytALYfXtPJKI1MqGp.png","name":"Point du Jour","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hiroshima: The Time of Return","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Hiroshima ou la temps d'un retour","type":"DVD case"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Lagier","original_name":"Luc Lagier","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5e484724676ce2001afe665c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Resnais","original_name":"Alain Resnais","popularity":0.2581,"profile_path":"/q5LF4OZ7BhNH44Jb9UDg3af57R9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5e4849331e9225001ac0ed1b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marguerite Duras","original_name":"Marguerite Duras","popularity":0.3234,"profile_path":"/fcwhMcwUzh4AtHew16vS4OVDYdO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5e4849a735811d0015468cbc","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1939052,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benoît Fort","original_name":"Benoît Fort","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613af86b5258ae0065a3cb31","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39161,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giovanni Fusco","original_name":"Giovanni Fusco","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/3zteU2F37Lx82pKvLIcg5lLVbYz.jpg","credit_id":"5e4849f8134d580012301f14","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3535,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georges Delerue","original_name":"Georges Delerue","popularity":0.2036,"profile_path":"/xKRsHzgZicN1KCUmnl4M09TVCxE.jpg","credit_id":"5e4847e935811d001746a05e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Lagier","original_name":"Luc Lagier","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e48471c134d5800123012ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564946,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alexandre Auque","original_name":"Alexandre Auque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e484a952d93750015a6a396","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564946,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alexandre Auque","original_name":"Alexandre Auque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e484a5d1e9225001ac0efcf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799085,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Léo Campagne","original_name":"Léo Campagne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e484b4d134d580018302979","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean-Stéphane Michaux","original_name":"Jean-Stéphane Michaux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e484b2f1e9225001dc09f40","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Noveaux Pictures DVD","release_date":"2005-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
