Flash forward five years later and we discover that fate has intervened leaving Mike s life in shambles. Natasha is gone and he is bitterly regretting having hired his close friend, Jason, an emotional and lost soul. Noel has disappeared into married life and Tien is deep in search of himself. With external pressures crushing him, Mike resorts to drinking heavily and begins experiencing delusions of his past and possible future. On the night of Tien return, the four friends gather once again to celebrate Tien wedding engagement. What happens next challenges our notions of true friendship, love, deceit, and revenge.  â€”Holman Chin","popularity":0.0506,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tequila: The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2540739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holman Chin","original_name":"Holman Chin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e497cd135811d0013485186","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302808,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christine Sham","original_name":"Christine Sham","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e497cf281da3900133ea91d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":986058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Taenaka","original_name":"Jimmy Taenaka","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/kTUw0RsoQzX2VtyDzg4YaWPW9Q4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e497d0c676ce20018001e8f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307114,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Lim","original_name":"Jonathan Lim","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/apFpmXj1l2olowZ6c6KQ1iElzb6.jpg","credit_id":"5e497cbc2d93750017a8dbc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1000725","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
