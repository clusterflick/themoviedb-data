Through the years, he became one with the environment and managed to survive despite the many difficulties. When his stay on the island is disturbed by the tenacity of the forestry commission he is still not willing to leave the island. A person’s destiny always lies in his worst fears. And unlike all our worst fears a strong will hidden behind a life makes it always a worthwhile story to tell.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/vF43ugF1WfJuRydfPk1iHeeI4qf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83795,"logo_path":"/rVGVWSXECBHSZqpXOeJ5Lpk3OGB.png","name":"SAE Institute","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2015-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelos Psomopoulos","original_name":"Angelos Psomopoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a879e2d93750015aa04d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541588,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alex Vilaras","original_name":"Alex Vilaras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a8a4035811d00174abc64","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541588,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alex Vilaras","original_name":"Alex Vilaras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a8a6b1e92250018c451a5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelos Psomopoulos","original_name":"Angelos Psomopoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a8a961e9225001dc44f22","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541590,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Loukianos Arnaoutakis","original_name":"Loukianos Arnaoutakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a8c8335811d00194a421e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541590,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Loukianos Arnaoutakis","original_name":"Loukianos Arnaoutakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a8cb32d93750013aa70ee","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541591,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marios Pavlou","original_name":"Marios Pavlou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a8cd59b8616001663ef75","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541591,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marios Pavlou","original_name":"Marios Pavlou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a8d032d93750017aaad62","department":"Sound","job":"Audio Post Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541592,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Kanavakis","original_name":"Chris Kanavakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a8d4e35811d00154a4143","department":"Sound","job":"Music Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelos Psomopoulos","original_name":"Angelos Psomopoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a8e5c9b86160018640185","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541598,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manos Smirlis","original_name":"Manos Smirlis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4a8ecf2d93750017aab0a0","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vF43ugF1WfJuRydfPk1iHeeI4qf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"17th Thessaloniki Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2015-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
