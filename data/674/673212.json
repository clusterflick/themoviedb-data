Finding himself to be more at peace in the calm, rural setting, Dunham feels the freedom to create wildly bold and visually stimulating work, painting his way through expression and sexuality. Continuously holding a mirror up to society, Dunham aims to examine the ways in which we interpret images and ideas surrounding the physical human form and our contrived notions of appropriate depictions of it through art and media. Dunham's large canvas works are flooded with vivid color and striking imagery that grabs the attention of its audience and encourages a reconsideration of form and gaze. \"The Artist's Studio: Carroll Dunham\" documents a visit with critic Roberta Smith as she observes his new captivating work: a series entitled \"In the Flowers\" and a large canvas \"The Beach\".","popularity":0.118,"poster_path":"/dbmsuZoXNPtJcyIeSMyhDdyRox6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Blackwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Artist's Studio: Carroll Dunham","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":982870,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mead Hunt","original_name":"Mead Hunt","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6249430c4bfa54004f91d62b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rima Yamazaki","original_name":"Rima Yamazaki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4856fb35811d001546a381","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2539841,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruce Engler","original_name":"Bruce Engler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e48571b676ce20015fe090f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2539840,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elinor Feist","original_name":"Elinor Feist","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e48571135811d001946a0c7","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"5e4856ec134d58001230398c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"5e4856d5134d58001a30661d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11620696","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9PrVJdB3pG88ZugVRioRbauoJ6h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sOatGTFgMAW0BYG2BmhIvIHaUKi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jcOJa9xJHiCHeig2gI5JWEwIDoL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wQr2u3BkfGkL2DSFS8ID7Gibj1o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oPihkAJJqf43yn3w2cT7z3lrdLt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kv1qGpNmq1I8kBGR5t0QmeKQfMt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6vpy4zy4Zi8siR3TEYPvIlLtKfV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3jgpFrpaGCQWT80dbzEC6KYTn5k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jcB0qOCTB3TWaCFxadc9U6wONkP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dbmsuZoXNPtJcyIeSMyhDdyRox6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
