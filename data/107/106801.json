Based on the short story by renowned author Max Lucado, Resurrection is set in Israel at the time of Christ. Claudius, a Roman guard, finds himself in the midst of a cover-up regarding the tumultuous events after Christ's execution.  As his digs for the truth, he discovers that the religious leaders, the Roman government and even his closest friends are attempting to hide something from him and the world. His relentless pursuit of the answers to his growing questions threatens his reputation-even his life.  Resurrection is the story of one man's quest for the truth and the discovery that leads to his renewal.","popularity":0.4494,"poster_path":"/2X1fqaUhUbSYhoOp9iNYJabPwaX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where The Passion Ends Resurrection Begins","title":"Resurrection","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1152977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Jobe","original_name":"Robert Jobe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Claudius","credit_id":"52fe4a71c3a36847f81ce313","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592391,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Steele","original_name":"Mark Steele","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Marcus","credit_id":"52fe4a71c3a36847f81ce32f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116557,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrea Jobe","original_name":"Andrea Jobe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a71c3a36847f81ce319","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":92528,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Max Lucado","original_name":"Max Lucado","popularity":0.1684,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a71c3a36847f81ce325","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116557,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrea Jobe","original_name":"Andrea Jobe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a71c3a36847f81ce31f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592391,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Steele","original_name":"Mark Steele","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a71c3a36847f81ce32b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0419090","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2249,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2X1fqaUhUbSYhoOp9iNYJabPwaX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/22Lsfm3q0pT50uwN8dNL14oIU2a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lW09AFPh6aS5ril5DGpdeG59Z5l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":186,"name":"christianity"},{"id":6506,"name":"resurrection"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Resurrection: trailer (based on a story by Max Lucado)","key":"blGsjXjphG8","published_at":"2011-02-12T05:13:30.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e0c3a368544800861b"}]}}}
