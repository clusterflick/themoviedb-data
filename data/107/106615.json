He played for the Calgary Flames, New York Rangers and Chicago Blackhawks. He made 50 million dollars and threw it away on drugs, alcohol and gambling. He reached bottom, and bought a gun intending to kill himself. At the last minute he changed his mind. He wrote a book revealing that, as a teen, he'd been sexually abused by his coach. It created a firestorm of publicity and went on to become a No. 1 bestseller in Canada. Theo starred in a top-rated skating competition reality show and had a cameo in the opening film at TIFF last year. Inspired by the book, the documentary follows Theo's struggle with the aftermath of the book and gives his turmoil a voice.","popularity":0.2608,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":140186,"logo_path":"/jK7c4shsoKwG5trE25U98NrCUQR.png","name":"Pyramid Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theo Fleury: Playing With Fire","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":503859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theo Fleury","original_name":"Theo Fleury","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4a6cc3a36847f81cd1b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":271186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron MacLean","original_name":"Ron MacLean","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4a6cc3a36847f81cd1bb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Embry","original_name":"Matt Embry","popularity":0.1371,"profile_path":"/g012JDOViepIjeygdnsCukuNyqm.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a6cc3a36847f81cd1c1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150547,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larry Day","original_name":"Larry Day","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/eGgY1ShXlq67r4l33INL5DmkIo2.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a6cc3a36847f81cd1c7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Embry","original_name":"Matt Embry","popularity":0.1371,"profile_path":"/g012JDOViepIjeygdnsCukuNyqm.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a6cc3a36847f81cd1af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1946486","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":260505,"name":"professional hockey player"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Calgary International Film Festival","release_date":"2011-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs","release_date":"2012-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Movie Network & Movie Central","release_date":"2012-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
