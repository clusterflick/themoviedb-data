This documentary is filled with close-up interviews, scrapbook photographs, video clips, news footage, letters read aloud, and other recollections, as different generations of Dutch peacekeeping soldiers recount the trauma of bloodshed from Korea to more recent events in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Their trusting, and often disturbing, personal revelations resound most poignantly when they talk about the single pieces of music that each found powerful enough to keep insanity at bay.","popularity":0.0631,"poster_path":"/axLpkipezqV7sYDVlQzqMP4w1pX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1999-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crazy","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1543017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ester Gould","original_name":"Ester Gould","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623a6b0afe6318005bc699f4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heddy Honigmann","original_name":"Heddy Honigmann","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/hAcQIVYwDxJA8ZSiaPh5ux1yIG3.jpg","credit_id":"623a6af5d7dcd2008bc5044e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heddy Honigmann","original_name":"Heddy Honigmann","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/hAcQIVYwDxJA8ZSiaPh5ux1yIG3.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a6cc3a36847f81cd0af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185247,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gregor Meerman","original_name":"Gregor Meerman","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63057959b87aec007dda07a6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351353,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mario Steenbergen","original_name":"Mario Steenbergen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63057964eb64f100847d1fc6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185251,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pieter van Huystee","original_name":"Pieter van Huystee","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63057972dcb6a3007bb20543","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0240433","wikidata_id":"Q5183081","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/axLpkipezqV7sYDVlQzqMP4w1pX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Blu ray","release_date":"2012-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nederland 1","release_date":"2006-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
