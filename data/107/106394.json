On a stormy night, \"cracking and ripping\" sounds and a \"shriek\" from below convince the panicky Roderick that \"We have put her living into the tomb!\" The shrouded, emaciated figure of Madeline appears at the door of Roderick's book-strewn study, falls upon him, \"and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse.\"","popularity":0.2397,"poster_path":"/tAQ85wZW4peogUJha88rT8SPq7v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fall of the House of Usher","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":48,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La caída de la casa Usher","type":"Castilian Spanish"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Stern","original_name":"Herbert Stern","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Roderick Usher","credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a36847f81cbf97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hildegarde Watson","original_name":"Hildegarde Watson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Madeline Usher","credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a36847f81cbf9b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melville Webber","original_name":"Melville Webber","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"A Traveller","credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a36847f81cbf9f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Sibley Watson","original_name":"James Sibley Watson","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a36847f81cbf7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melville Webber","original_name":"Melville Webber","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a36847f81cbf81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Sibley Watson","original_name":"James Sibley Watson","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a36847f81cbf87","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melville Webber","original_name":"Melville Webber","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a36847f81cbf8d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040177,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alec Wilder","original_name":"Alec Wilder","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a36847f81cbf93","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Sibley Watson","original_name":"James Sibley Watson","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a36847f81cbfa5","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melville Webber","original_name":"Melville Webber","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a36847f81cbfab","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edgar Allan Poe","original_name":"Edgar Allan Poe","popularity":0.2812,"profile_path":"/AlgddAgqBWRZUNHtX2Rue60HSIg.jpg","credit_id":"652ad5c2f28838029ec5682b","department":"Writing","job":"Short Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0018873","wikidata_id":"Q1844413","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tyZNDc0NCpSsbqth53svUa3avlW.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":1371,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tAQ85wZW4peogUJha88rT8SPq7v.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":1371,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d6OS2vNIk77N8f5nWZ2j6Ol7V4Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1928-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
