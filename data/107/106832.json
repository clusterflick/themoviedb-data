A group of starving, but young and willing, actors band together to share finances and an apartment. Norman Reese (William Holden) orders no love nonsense between the boys and girls till they are set on broadway, but Marge Benson (Barbara Britton) and Tony Dennison (James Brown) are already secretly married. A friend drops in to see Dottie Coburn (Martha O'Driscoll) and is shocked to find the boys and girls sharing the same apartment and insists it is her duty to inform Dottie's father (Jay Fassett.)","popularity":0.6469,"poster_path":"/17h7jjDhNH8JAZ4JVxW91ENM4Qa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Young and Willing","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Holden","original_name":"William Holden","popularity":1.1317,"profile_path":"/yx5LpyKzCc4H52mFjybrPTuwKPM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Norman Reese","credit_id":"52fe4a72c3a36847f81ce64f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Bracken","original_name":"Eddie Bracken","popularity":0.53,"profile_path":"/r7FMivfxnlnluluZ1JyxCPIacL4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"George Bodell","credit_id":"52fe4a72c3a36847f81ce653","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Hayward","original_name":"Susan Hayward","popularity":1.4115,"profile_path":"/cGCzhMs9Tr6o9u92H6LvxwW0Tkh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kate Benson","credit_id":"52fe4a72c3a36847f81ce657","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Benchley","original_name":"Robert Benchley","popularity":0.1837,"profile_path":"/qXJtEUZW459w8hKEcvo4FauhOBy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Arthur Kenny","credit_id":"52fe4a72c3a36847f81ce65b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha O'Driscoll","original_name":"Martha O'Driscoll","popularity":0.1305,"profile_path":"/9qpbAIKWrQVDPAQm2V4UEX7yaae.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dottie Coburn","credit_id":"52fe4a72c3a36847f81ce65f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Britton","original_name":"Barbara Britton","popularity":0.218,"profile_path":"/thwiFPj8vmkxBZp3tl5Js4tFdwJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Marge Benson Dennison","credit_id":"52fe4a72c3a36847f81ce663","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Paige","original_name":"Mabel Paige","popularity":0.2114,"profile_path":"/khc3P9c1O7x3Qi1zDpOp5gZ0ndr.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Mrs. Garnet","credit_id":"52fe4a72c3a36847f81ce697","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":179339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence MacMichael","original_name":"Florence MacMichael","popularity":0.1513,"profile_path":"/l7lTRWGSlo1lkE4htHfn0iPFjKQ.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Muriel Foster","credit_id":"52fe4a72c3a36847f81ce69b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Brown","original_name":"James Brown","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/u2p8vDXhgYEZu36HOvXqHh3VyMi.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Tony Dennison","credit_id":"52fe4a72c3a36847f81ce69f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1150486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Fassett","original_name":"Jay Fassett","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"J.T.
