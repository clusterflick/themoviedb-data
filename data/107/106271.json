For Motor Man Dan, the ultimate would be to have his very own serial killer, to fulfill his sick, obsessive, murderous appetite. Ryan, the victim of a terrible accident who suffered severe head trauma, would be that missing piece to complete Motor Man's demented collection. Motor Man would then tool and manufacture a half machine, half man, serial killer, which he would then orchestrate and produce an assortment of killing scenarios. From director Craig McMahon comes this gruesome/slasher tale of a desolate man that took collecting serious.","popularity":0.2611,"poster_path":"/ukO4F1ulyY3QgBHreV1uCM9jori.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Auto, food, and lodging...MOTORMAN DAN'S","title":"Machined","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David C.
