In the morning the land's owner Rafe turns up and orders them to get off his lawn but changes his mind when one of the girls emerges naked from the tent. Rafe explains he only comes down to the house at weekends and lets them stay providing they redecorate his house. The squatters agree but once Rafe leaves they plot to organize a pop festival at the house. Attempting to raise cash for the venture, the men coerce their girlfriends into making a blue movie. When this proves disastrous Jeff goes to London and poses as a pop journalist in order to book the groups \"Crazy Mabel\" and \"The Juicy Lucy\" for the festival.","popularity":0.4315,"poster_path":"/2tnuli7vBLb5wyT2HlIDmnFp1R2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19970,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salon Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1971-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bread","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Nigel","original_name":"Anthony Nigel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mick","credit_id":"52fe4a73c3a36847f81ce99f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Marinker","original_name":"Peter Marinker","popularity":0.2228,"profile_path":"/ys24WuW2ebo6KTn0Jz2qJL3RnV9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jeff","credit_id":"52fe4a73c3a36847f81ce9a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Haydon","original_name":"Dick Haydon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Trev","credit_id":"52fe4a73c3a36847f81ce9a7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noelle Rimmington","original_name":"Noelle Rimmington","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Cathy","credit_id":"52fe4a73c3a36847f81ce9ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2608195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz White","original_name":"Liz White","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Marty","credit_id":"5e9d4f48f6fd18001be64b9b","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2338769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yocki Rhodes","original_name":"Yocki Rhodes","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Terry","credit_id":"5e9d4f74680be80026c6049d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael McStay","original_name":"Michael McStay","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Rafe Bates","credit_id":"5e9d4f8de22d28001b6249c5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penny Brahms","original_name":"Penny Brahms","popularity":0.1959,"profile_path":"/uFjTuQ02DL7fHF4FpazTkA9q0W1.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Jan","credit_id":"5e9d4fa2dff66e001e0a6787","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Lynch","original_name":"Sean Lynch","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/iHbQyOWQcBZ6jU6Tk1JchqgEvD0.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Danny Brooks","credit_id":"5e9d4fdda5046e00259a2280","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Howard","original_name":"Ben Howard","popularity":0.281,"profile_path":"/6z8s5BZmzzEt0bIKuVzrHjqJOBs.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Gerry","credit_id":"64b99e5e11386c012df29f26","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1622386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter May","original_name":"Peter May","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":34,"character":"Policeman","credit_id":"67b9b7be06b5536bdc0a7b8d","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":568422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanley A.
