One of the aliens steals into a cave beneath a temple where the hapless but lovable Magic Lizard appears to be responsible for guarding some kind of treasure. After threatening Magic Lizard with a light saber, the alien makes off with a crystal of some sort, after which Magic Lizard starts with the high-pitched nattering and spazzing out that will characterize his behavior for the rest of the film. He runs to Yuk Wud Jaeng, the demon-like living statue previously featured in both Giant and Jumbo A and Tah Tien and pleads for his help. Yuk Wud Jaeng takes off into the heavens, not to be seen again for some time.","popularity":0.3102,"poster_path":"/8kC8ZXi8utk42wEyKaMAA3nowU5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chaiyo Productions","origin_country":"TH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magic Lizard","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","title":"King-Ka Kayasit","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","title":"King-ka kay-a-sit","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sawong Supsamruay","original_name":"Sawong Supsamruay","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/3AEbiS5Ymtb2uAwf0j2ca8JA4gS.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69215afbe36f0036432cda","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Promma Satongkaew","original_name":"Promma Satongkaew","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69242de267de003516706d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Si Tao","original_name":"Si Tao","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"","credit_id":"5f692440dbcade00382b54fb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lak Apichart","original_name":"Lak Apichart","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"","credit_id":"5f692292955c65003a7e4a2a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1267894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Der Doksadao","original_name":"เด๋อ ดอกสะเดา","popularity":0.3272,"profile_path":"/gE8fYx55T6aVKYCfXaOynEa5E5j.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"","credit_id":"65046e85ffc9de0ee178b323","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sompote Sands","original_name":"สมโพธิ แสงเดือนฉาย","popularity":0.0979,"profile_path":"/qR42VY0cQQMNiwa6gGIMBjnfBP6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a69c3a36847f81cc543","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sompote Sands","original_name":"สมโพธิ แสงเดือนฉาย","popularity":0.0979,"profile_path":"/qR42VY0cQQMNiwa6gGIMBjnfBP6.jpg","credit_id":"5f69239d688cd000351a5899","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787376,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wannee Thanarungroj","original_name":"Wannee Thanarungroj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6923bda0b690003848c360","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3263000","wikidata_id":"Q13013086","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.687,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8kC8ZXi8utk42wEyKaMAA3nowU5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":515}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11100,"name":"giant monster"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
