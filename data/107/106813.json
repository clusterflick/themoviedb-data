His convictions cost him his life.  What is a moral person to do in a time of savage immorality? That question tormented Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German clergyman of great distinction who actively opposed Hitler and the Nazis. His convictions cost him his life. The Nazis hanged him on April 9, 1945, less than a month before the end of the war. Bonhoeffer's last years, his participation in the German resistance and his moral struggle are dramatized in this film. More than just a biographical portrait, Bonhoeffer: Agent of Grace sheds light on the little-known efforts of the German resistance. It brings to a wide audience the heroic rebellion of Bonhoeffer, a highly regarded Lutheran minister who could have kept his peace and saved his life on several occasions but instead paid the ultimate price for his beliefs.","popularity":3.0104,"poster_path":"/5YtByr36A3Sa1WMjzz8LgTfbYDu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A true story of love, courage, and sacrifice.","title":"Bonhoeffer: Agent of Grace","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrich Tukur","original_name":"Ulrich Tukur","popularity":0.3785,"profile_path":"/8cRioOXiW0FSN0eWysHWdl4leEf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer","credit_id":"5345315fc3a3682589001572","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":987286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Klante","original_name":"Johanna Klante","popularity":0.3098,"profile_path":"/2RNxLHlYg2PUKyQP9yLxcmWRSvF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maria von Wedemeyer","credit_id":"5345317fc3a36825820014ea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":274256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatjana Blacher","original_name":"Tatjana Blacher","popularity":0.2274,"profile_path":"/fbLGQTnBZdSkX3Oe2F9SdKZB3F3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Christel von Dohnanyi","credit_id":"534531afc3a36825b10014d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrich Noethen","original_name":"Ulrich Noethen","popularity":0.2812,"profile_path":"/wetpWDhR88VBNXq1vjq6JT8N4O1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hans von Dohnanyi","credit_id":"534531dcc3a36825a00014eb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne Lothar","original_name":"Susanne Lothar","popularity":0.2474,"profile_path":"/51CyaN2rUTqvIiidOdOGvAyEGk6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sabine Leibholz","credit_id":"534531f8c3a36825910014a7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Horwitz","original_name":"Dominique Horwitz","popularity":0.2133,"profile_path":"/3YuwwLvwuDjl6R9RnBQ03A6vp3R.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gerhard Leibholz","credit_id":"53453213c3a36825980014b6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justus von Dohnányi","original_name":"Justus von Dohnányi","popularity":0.238,"profile_path":"/2zg2pY7w3X3z4FyYEqzlBHFZXK1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Eberhard Bethge","credit_id":"53453239c3a3682589001591","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemarie Fendel","original_name":"Rosemarie Fendel","popularity":0.1244,"profile_path":"/clBY9ks4qQ7t6ptx58msUMm44tP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ruth von Kleist-Retzow","credit_id":"53453260c3a36825b10014e4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dieter Kirchlechner","original_name":"Dieter Kirchlechner","popularity":0.1663,"profile_path":"/qsQtq38AtJXgf1r9jLyvpghqgP7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Josef Müller","credit_id":"53453275c3a36825a800147a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Doermer","original_name":"Christian Doermer","popularity":0.1183,"profile_path":"/kVmiixVm76FDAvMfeULihu0RrLu.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"General Hans Oster","credit_id":"53453298c3a36825b300140e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulli Philipp","original_name":"Ulli Philipp","popularity":0.1805,"profile_path":"/l03gxnr9XFlibN5eoQ1LJblEWV2.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Charlotte Friedenthal","credit_id":"534532adc3a36825b3001412","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Till","original_name":"Eric Till","popularity":0.1616,"profile_path":"/7WdzAO8FikKcOZiwPwM6zXCo8LA.jpg","credit_id":"53453149c3a36825a800144c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Till","original_name":"Eric Till","popularity":0.1616,"profile_path":"/7WdzAO8FikKcOZiwPwM6zXCo8LA.jpg","credit_id":"6494deb2d236e600e4733cd7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1258471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian P.
