Informed by the techniques of cinema verit√© and direct cinema developed in the 1960's by master documentary filmmakers, the band is allowed the space to do what they do without intrusions of any kind from the filmmaker, allowing for glimpses into the magical and mundane moments of everyday life in a hard working action rock band abroad. The Hellacopters: Goodnight Cleveland is a relaxed and open-handed portrait of a band on the road. Essential viewing for anyone pondering a career in the music business, or anyone merely curious.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/cuaemKB4T1Giu0tTwyCiPwB3CfV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hellacopters: Goodnight Cleveland","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0388997","wikidata_id":"Q5583515","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1471,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cuaemKB4T1Giu0tTwyCiPwB3CfV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
