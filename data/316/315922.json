A convent-bred lass on the verge of taking her final vows, Maria falls in love with a handsome artist, portrayed by popular operatic baritone Sandor Sved. Due to a silly misunderstanding, she walks out on Sved and marries his best friend Paul Javor. The frustrated suitor quits the art world to become a world-famous concert singer. Years later, he returns to reclaim Maria, only to find that she's not only still a wife, but also a mother and a dedicated nurse. Gracefully bowing out of her life, the Pagliacci-like Sved continues his singing career to assuage his broken heart.","popularity":0.2737,"poster_path":"/rr4XF6blL0WieFHVthse4d9bYo6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1704,"logo_path":"/sb3PuMTgJgpPUY7x634etBAhodu.png","name":"Bavaria
