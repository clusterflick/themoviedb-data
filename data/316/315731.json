While she's in the throne room awaiting him, he's outside playing with guns, drilling his soldiers, and dallying with the wife of a new minister. The queen catches him kissing her, her husband figures out that something fishy is going on, and the king tries his best to proceed with his plans for a night out. The queen contrives to keep him cuffed in the bedroom: king, queen, minister, and coquette end up in a game of musical beds. Will his royal highness get his night out?","popularity":0.5124,"poster_path":"/cyHYDdd3oqfZy5SW4taWzvsmvsW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The King","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Langdon","original_name":"Harry Langdon","popularity":0.1561,"profile_path":"/AuL3EB6cPn57RpdGkT3dgAqnb1s.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"The King","credit_id":"54aa5ec5925141580e001278","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thelma Todd","original_name":"Thelma Todd","popularity":0.2588,"profile_path":"/pXImIsfL2n0AXFB5fPWj3nb7fKK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Queen","credit_id":"54aa5ed6925141564600137a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Granger","original_name":"Dorothy Granger","popularity":0.2115,"profile_path":"/3iNHKiEQ0wx2bTYMzG2YdRz28HK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lady in Waiting (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa5ee89251414d670064eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles McAvoy","original_name":"Charles McAvoy","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Guard (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa5efac3a3680c21006f34","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1409239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Michigan","original_name":"Brad Michigan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Guard (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa5f0cc3a3680c21006f39","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Parrott","original_name":"James Parrott","popularity":0.3597,"profile_path":"/od32ZGilfKocacyL4EBKdcqkaL4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Minor Role (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa5f1d92514155f2001376","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Rogers","original_name":"Charley Rogers","popularity":0.1542,"profile_path":"/idd27mJQDuxXGduMeM11qfznC77.jpg","credit_id":"54aa5f3f9251414d670064f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131405,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James W.
