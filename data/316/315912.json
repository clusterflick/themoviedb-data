Given a six-hour pass after a tour of duty in India, several British Tommies (among them Robert Newton, Sebastian Shaw and Anthony Bushell) try to unravel their domestic tribulations before having to ship out again. American expatriate Tim Whelan was the directorial hand who kept the various plot threads from entangling, while another Hollywood vet, James Wong Howe, manned the cameras. The film became instantly dated with the advent of World War II, but in its own time Farewell Again was a box-office smash. The film was issued in the US as Troopship.","popularity":0.6923,"poster_path":"/9MzMiOwurXO99G6FbN4aXYZjPp4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":659,"logo_path":null,"name":"London Films Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1937-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell Again","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Troopship","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Banks","original_name":"Leslie Banks","popularity":0.1931,"profile_path":"/nZuJTNrU2stqxn7L39ELyaq1A42.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Col.
