After the wars of 1848, a retired Austrian army officer \"returns to the soil\" as a gentleman farmer in Hungary in the 1850s. The old campaigner is the father of two daughters: One of the girls comes to a sad end thanks to the malfeasances of a handsome spy, but the other has a happier fate when she falls in love with a Hungarian POW. The underlying theme is brotherhood, as the formerly warring Austrians and Hungarians at last find a common ground. Az Uj Foldesur was nearly twice as expensive as the average Hungarian film -- but at $40,000, its budget was a drop in the bucket compared to a typical Hollywood production.","popularity":0.242,"poster_path":"/cVj9gxF9rTeaZ6Dpr0BFCaRNmJq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90035,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hirsch and
