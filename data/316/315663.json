Mourning the loss of the only woman he ever loved, concert singer Tino Dossi (Gigli) is temporarily shaken from his doldrums by vivacious Montmartre entertainer Claudette (Kaethe Von Nagy). Dossi doesn't realize that Claudette is merely using him to advance her own singing career. Ultimately won over by Dossi's sincerity and courtesy, Claudette falls in love with him for real, only to suffer the pangs of conscience as a result. About to kill herself, she decides instead to return to Dossi's arms, vowing never to confess her original mercenary intentions.","popularity":0.137,"poster_path":"/lWqwZHK5xxnOFuR4XeHMjgB5qR1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1936-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ave Maria","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beniamino Gigli","original_name":"Beniamino Gigli","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":"/y7Rn9Kqe8veAzZe67UlbJ1qZzWa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tino Dossi","credit_id":"5a4d71869251417348000488","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"K채the von Nagy","original_name":"K채the von Nagy","popularity":0.1331,"profile_path":"/dP0fB5yzACRMv1C4zvNVzE35DRJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Claudette","credit_id":"5a4d71a00e0a26481400051a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harald Paulsen","original_name":"Harald Paulsen","popularity":0.1937,"profile_path":"/m7JkKrut1Z1VnZTcuuJQcf6a1rI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Michel","credit_id":"5a4d71ab9251417345000495","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Henckels","original_name":"Paul Henckels","popularity":0.2057,"profile_path":"/lOB0gXEAfTF5HO3Iu27OHKGLDhA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Amadeo Winkler","credit_id":"5a4d71c2c3a3683b7400054d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1118209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erna Berger","original_name":"Erna Berger","popularity":0.0915,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Violetta","credit_id":"5a4d71eb9251417343000511","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Auen","original_name":"Carl Auen","popularity":0.1824,"profile_path":"/otYwELAjrtTTCWExxC7Fm83Nolp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Arzt","credit_id":"5c3d19dd9251415524acb234","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert H체bner","original_name":"Herbert H체bner","popularity":0.2858,"profile_path":"/hUHd2MXZM7t7gxEh7p6zBMDLAuh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Konzertdirektor","credit_id":"5c3d19ee0e0a2654c18e2842","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Curt Blachnitzky","original_name":"Curt Blachnitzky","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62863a651f3e600052e256d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Riemann","original_name":"Johannes Riemann","popularity":0.2316,"profile_path":"/46LG5vuLB9TZ3ltgu0Oo6MtCUfI.jpg","credit_id":"54a9c6a6c3a368077b002d63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0027319","wikidata_id":"Q2873380","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":2574,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lWqwZHK5xxnOFuR4XeHMjgB5qR1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1697}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
