In 1825, impoverished composer Max (Patric Knowles) enrolls at Heidelburg University. Local girl Veronika (Carol Goodner) falls in love with Max, helping him to finance his education and clear his debts. Alas, Veronika is left out in the cold when Max becomes enamored with gorgeous tourist Helene (Grete Natzler). Little does he know that Helene is the daughter of the Grand Duke (Ivan Simpson), meaning of course that their romance is doomed to disappointment. Leading lady Grete Natzler later changed her screen name to Della Lynd, and under that cognomen co-starred with Laurel & Hardy in Swiss Miss (1938).","popularity":0.9181,"poster_path":"/2H8H0qi5CHZdclSE5T9MTDS7egr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1441,"logo_path":"/28DJnfE2ZaR5oNJVlZ38uvnLaCH.png","name":"Associated British Picture Corporation","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Student's Romance","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grete Natzler","original_name":"Grete Natzler","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/hSTQmiZvY2m5w5M4ONJCrze4VT8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Princess Helene","credit_id":"58406b9d9251416f3c000e5f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patric Knowles","original_name":"Patric Knowles","popularity":0.2789,"profile_path":"/sponrKX5PpUydRstnn69KjD1qpQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Max Brandt","credit_id":"58406babc3a36832c8000ee2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.H.
