Though Liszt himself is a major character, the heroine of the piece is Hungarian countess Maria Duday (Maria Salyok). Leaving her fiancé at the altar, Maria insists upon becoming Liszt's pupil. In addition to her passion for her teacher, Maria also becomes involved with a young orchestra conductor, who ends up being wounded in a duel with her ex-fiancé. In the end, however, Maria and the musician are reunited as she plays a Liszt concerto under his direction. A German-language version of Szerelmi Almok was filmed simultaneously with a different cast.","popularity":0.0723,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1485744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferenc Táray","original_name":"Ferenc Táray","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"559e9ba49251412db2001a66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1485745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"László Z.
