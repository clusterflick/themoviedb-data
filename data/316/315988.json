Hellmuth Costard places these basic prerequisites at the centre of his film: using a Super 8 camera system he developed, he films himself as he tries to raise funding for his film project. This creates an unconventional experimental setup, which reveals how the economics, politics, technology and aesthetics of filmmaking relate to each other – with the ‘great’ Godard being called up as a kind of chief witness.","popularity":0.247,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1978-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little
