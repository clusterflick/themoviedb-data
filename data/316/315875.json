They try to achieve success there with a play that speaks of man and his passage through life, but the spectators are becoming increasingly scarce. One day his old car breaks down and they stop at Zapallares, a lost town. There, on the eve of the municipal elections, they meet an old friend, Professor Roberto Tolosa (Dario Grandinetti), critical of the construction of a new hotel and with the political class of the place and that will try to reopen a theater with the help of their fifth-year students, despite opposition from politicians.","popularity":0.2631,"poster_path":"/gj1Ybg6GkYJJEkSyTLf9huXzRAO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1996-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El
