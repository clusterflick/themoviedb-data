Bound by the rules of the confessional, the cardinal is unable to disclose the multitude of sins revealed to him by one of his most influential parishioners. De Medici's dilemma is compounded by the fact that the confessor has committed a murder for which the Cardinal's brother has been arrested. The basic plot gimmick was good for another go-round in the 1953 Hitchcock flick I Confess. This 7-reel British film was based on a play by Louis N. Parker.","popularity":0.2896,"poster_path":"/feCTWPsEXqdlR1ojSy0q9kgKdWj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grosvenor Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1936-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cardinal","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matheson Lang","original_name":"Matheson Lang","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/qulfklVkQuXIdbuzhhyARbIyZjq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Cardinal de Medici","credit_id":"578a28e59251410deb004f39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Portman","original_name":"Eric Portman","popularity":0.2809,"profile_path":"/37W0YteueUf1Y6xUlJj0zmftcHB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Giuliano de Medici","credit_id":"578a28f4c3a3686a650064fe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Atkins","original_name":"Robert Atkins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"General Belmont","credit_id":"578a290292514163e8002da9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"O.B.
