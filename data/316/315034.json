One day, an army passes by the church near the border, and the two young ladies volunteer to take them to the base of the hostile force. On the way there, they witness the hardship and cruelty that the war has brought to their peaceful, holy-land. The war has also given them a better vision of love and understanding of humanity. The war is now over, and they must decide whether to leave the church for new found love or stay living alone.","popularity":0.294,"poster_path":"/1rM0jrWu5KZ5Il7oL5eX9SiczbR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73740,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yeh Hung-wei Film Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":4582,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xi'an Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home in My Heart","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"星语心愿","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"绝顶边缘","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Ring","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shu Qi","original_name":"舒淇","popularity":2.9069,"profile_path":"/ycuwRV9fEKieAAZN81rC3xcuxaE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lai","credit_id":"54a4b6f9c3a3680b27010da5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":120419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Wu","original_name":"Annie Wu","popularity":0.558,"profile_path":"/dy2oh3nXPXWLHEoSoaLYTchJxAR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Chun","credit_id":"54a4b6fec3a3682f1e0130e6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326287,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hung-Wei Yeh","original_name":"Hung-Wei Yeh","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54a4b6efc3a3682f1e0130e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326287,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hung-Wei Yeh","original_name":"Hung-Wei Yeh","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d357b19251413e6a010a0f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3980262","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/1rM0jrWu5KZ5Il7oL5eX9SiczbR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":570}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
