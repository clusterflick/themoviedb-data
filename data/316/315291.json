Throughout the majority of her music career, beginning in 1999, a world tour by Lopez was anticipated, though it never materialized. Following the release of her seventh studio album Love? (2011), she was more intent on touring than ever. However, it was not until March 2012 when the tour came into the works. As rumors began to circulate, Lopez later confirmed that April that she would be embarking on her first world tour. It commenced on June 14, 2012, in Panama City, Panama, and concluded on December 22, 2012, in San Juan, Puerto Rico.","popularity":2.0327,"poster_path":"/1i1Srwy1V9yNpglCbFI8paykIua.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1620,"logo_path":"/yTI712cgl8hh6FNT5E6td0eHfNb.png","name":"Nuyorican Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":308,"logo_path":"/e8F3mQM7DkJ5SfYYDp8FYzPBOGX.png","name":"The Weinstein Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jennifer Lopez: Dance Again","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":34,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Lopez","original_name":"Jennifer Lopez","popularity":5.0699,"profile_path":"/icNEXl1ziSvOKsnhtydi8BZppsY.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54a7255ec3a3680c3300010d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":167662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Seacrest","original_name":"Ryan Seacrest","popularity":1.2218,"profile_path":"/crjHM1N6RKMOOxwWXf070B4NDy3.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e5d242e357c0000132be89e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1215501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Jackson","original_name":"Randy Jackson","popularity":0.3438,"profile_path":"/57Jqf5iHDgp2EaRRLqCcM1vvNk1.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e5d247087e63e001a73fe51","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66733,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Benny Medina","original_name":"Benny Medina","popularity":0.1463,"profile_path":"/tjhHjHit7bvAotGT7wlJviPHBHs.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self -
