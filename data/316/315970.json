To prove him wrong, Clytie decides to feign a robbery and enters an apartment through an open window. She is apprehended by a policeman, who mistakes her for local robber \"Powder Nose Annie.\" Gilpin sees her in jail and, posing as crook Jimmy of the Dives, arranges to break her out and take her on a robbing spree. Finally, Jimmy returns her to her parents and then calls at her home as Gilpin, the critic. Clytie is suprised but forgives the deception and agrees to marry him.","popularity":0.4277,"poster_path":"/cZHAGBuPYOzr6zfARi1eN06eFGv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Danger Game","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madge Kennedy","original_name":"Madge Kennedy","popularity":0.1901,"profile_path":"/mVULjQWCITbvjCVNaRNu6RiNAH0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Clytie Rogers","credit_id":"54abf8069251416343000fcb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":166297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Moore","original_name":"Tom Moore","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/kFvjLdK2Tcw7cUbWcLo5vQeS0Bd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jimmy Gilpin","credit_id":"54abf84f92514155f2003da2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1409844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Doucet","original_name":"Paul Doucet","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"LeRoy Hunter","credit_id":"54abf8a7c3a3680c30009996","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1391875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ned Burton","original_name":"Ned Burton","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"William Rogers","credit_id":"54abf8b5c3a36822b7004061","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Ballin","original_name":"Mabel Ballin","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/1BHWwS9oA3sE2CnknHA3vbuzh6v.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"May Wentworth","credit_id":"54abf8c2c3a3682352003e35","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1409845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Blancke","original_name":"Kate Blancke","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/dDXIqrUuXZK5Xc0P3LtdicG0vz3.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Rogers","credit_id":"54abf8cbc3a368241e0031da","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1409843,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roy Somerville","original_name":"Roy Somerville","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54abf7f79251416343000fc6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry A.
