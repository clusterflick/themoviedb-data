She has kept her terminal diagnosis secret from everyone around her, her housekeeper and gardener, as well as her estranged son, Justin. As her health continues to decline, her doctor insists it is time to bring in a live-in nurse at home. Stubbornly proud, Norma rejects every candidate for the job straight away. That is until she comes across Emma Keating, who refuses to take no for an answer and whole-heartedly agrees to keep Norma’s secret.","popularity":1.9409,"poster_path":"/cMN1k1RrKDNP0MsuAZbKiE9Nlqf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Larry Levinson Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Touched","video":false,"vote_average":6.182,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'Infirmière du coeur","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Touched by Romance","type":"UPTV"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Roberts","original_name":"Doris Roberts","popularity":1.2213,"profile_path":"/bfJjsAKKRqUhm1lh2QC8u2atrov.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Norma","credit_id":"54a59d17c3a3682f1e014bab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":77767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachael Carpani","original_name":"Rachael Carpani","popularity":0.4709,"profile_path":"/vDV6e5Af9oJ110gtwAHRyLpZv53.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Emma","credit_id":"54a59cff9251411d5300f72e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Page","original_name":"Sam Page","popularity":1.0456,"profile_path":"/6yza06QDrRoOXWxGd2AmYZw9e1u.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Justin","credit_id":"54a59d0bc3a3684d8f007ea1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Hudson","original_name":"Ernie Hudson","popularity":1.506,"profile_path":"/kgAdQA2ItCDVvKXufeDHc6Omiso.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Beck","credit_id":"5601c246c3a3685541000082","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Gartin","original_name":"Chris Gartin","popularity":0.4754,"profile_path":"/6Oy9QRX9BjMc7rHFC0ttaI778i0.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Henry Luther","credit_id":"5601c3ef92514122c300009c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1225045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Bond","original_name":"Elizabeth Bond","popularity":0.3439,"profile_path":"/nIJXeZjiPjSuMNjAq5TFYf3Bgc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Amber Fells","credit_id":"54a59cefc3a3682f1b014fad","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tessie Santiago","original_name":"Tessie Santiago","popularity":0.1636,"profile_path":"/afaP3UZvfI8ugUReG9vkTxmOdZf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maria Luther","credit_id":"54a59d249251414e2800f7cf","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bradford May","original_name":"Bradford May","popularity":0.2027,"profile_path":"/p7pC1Ih1sSPyN8qBXZl1dYeNDKT.jpg","credit_id":"5601763292514122900019d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513592,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Urbina","original_name":"David Urbina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5601c39ac3a368553200006e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151127,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James W.
