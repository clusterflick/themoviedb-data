Influenced by the absurd humor of MONTY PYTHON, he was publicly acknowledged by them when they dubbed him \"The Lost Python\". Eddie Izzard is a master of switching between subjects with the most unexpected transitions and an unbridled energy. In his elegant and absurd universe he tells us his version of the history of humanity: from the Stone Age to the modern-day man, from the origins of language to Wikipedia, from banjos to helicopters, or even from the creation of the world to... bananas.","popularity":0.4926,"poster_path":"/uKMNYeppcFlgJ8GiBvK9m9Q3Ugc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eddie Izzard - Stripped : Tout en français","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Izzard","original_name":"Eddie Izzard","popularity":1.1846,"profile_path":"/H8zar1LxJu5jgThl33z59g2iqO.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Eddie Izzard","credit_id":"54a9ab28c3a3680c2100571d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Izzard","original_name":"Eddie Izzard","popularity":1.1846,"profile_path":"/H8zar1LxJu5jgThl33z59g2iqO.jpg","credit_id":"5fe17617f9a3fb003cbdc51d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fMcYkiSlw5yDiIdVowfNu7CTulc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/oWqbCuzqUwJ9inijyqzUvAAHqh9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uKMNYeppcFlgJ8GiBvK9m9Q3Ugc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
