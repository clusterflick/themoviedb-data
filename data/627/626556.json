In the film, all types of images flash quickly on screen. Images include fried eggs, Marlboro cigarette packages, and the American flag. The film continues flashing images in a quick, rhythmic pace and only slows down at three points in the film. The first slow sequence, is in a junkyard where an automobile is being set down by a tow truck. The second sequence is of two females in the nude, chatting, smoking, and eating saltines. The final slow sequence is of a man who appears to stick his tongue out, but as his \"tongue\" is pulled out further, it becomes apparent it's some sort of pink substanceâ€”not his tongue. In this film and in Festival of the Cyclists, Byron re-uses some of the same film scenes to create original content.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/ygbr4cju9sitYezFsZDPDMzb89H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hexagrams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2396421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Byron Grush","original_name":"Byron Grush","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d659b0058361b0013213c1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.741,"height":2062,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ygbr4cju9sitYezFsZDPDMzb89H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1527}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Knokke Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"1967-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
