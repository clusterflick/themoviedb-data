Dynastic managers are few and far between. They are disposable commodities in a ruthless industry which hires and fires with impunity.  In the 2018-19 season, 44 of the 92 managers in top four leagues lost their job. The merry-go-round was in full swing in the non-leagues, too.  The Gaffer, the latest in BT Sport’s award-winning series of feature-length documentaries, offers an intimate and compelling insight into the life of five National League managers in and out of the dugout.  Starring Harrogate Town’s Simon Weaver, Bromley-born Neil Smith managing his hometown club, lower league legend John Still and his mentee Hakan Hayrettin at Maidstone United, Eastleigh’s Ben Strevens in his first season as a manager, and Craig Hignett at Hartlepool United, the film provides an extraordinary fly-on-the wall account of life in charge of non-league clubs.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A unique glimpse into the world of non-league management","title":"The Gaffer","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
