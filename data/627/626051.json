As you take out your sword to contend with your foe, he proclaims, “Ha! I don’t believe in swords.”  You have three options.  1. Give him a lesson in metallurgy.  2. Apologize and put away your sword.  3. Cut him.  Dr. Voddie Baucham believes it is time for Christians to:  -Stop trying to prove the Bible is authentic.  -Stop apologizing for quoting Scripture in battle.  Dr. Baucham says it is time to start employing the two-edged sword like never before.  How does a Christian brandish that sword in a culture that scoffs, “Ha! We don’t  believe in the Bible!\"?  Let Dr. Voddie Baucham equip you to contend earnestly for the faith, not by putting our sword of Scripture in a sheath, but taking it out and wielding it.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oebu7KWyj1cR9rZnYTZbQNJP0yG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Expository Apologetics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oebu7KWyj1cR9rZnYTZbQNJP0yG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
