Somehow the Evangelical Church has turned the glorious gospel into:  A life enhancement program  A system to clean up the outside of the cup  A health and wealth promise  The gospel is none of those things. The gospel is far more magnificent.  Gospel Clarity seeks to reclaim the staggeringly glorious message of the gospel. Prepare to learn the true great news of the gospel for the first time, or be refreshed and reminded that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wretched Worldview - Gospel Clarity","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
