A woman suffers a panic attack on the street. The mundane life of a fireman is overlaid by the fragmented remnants of a burnt-out house. A deformed man's face fluctuates between broken and unbroken as a traffic accident occurs behind him. Electrical currents run through a boy's burnt legs. Something scurries through multi-coloured woods to the accompaniment of explosions. This is the world of British public information films, remixed and edited to create something new and experimental.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/uMZYq3xebkJkLotKJJgCwNnIEsN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dragonflower Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2017-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"British public information films like you've never seen them before.","title":"Experiment One: Lost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1979152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamish Newcombe","original_name":"Hamish Newcombe","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/iziNVoG48K6pYFYIA55U4D1C2Gy.jpg","credit_id":"5d632467bc8abc176c25b611","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1979152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamish Newcombe","original_name":"Hamish Newcombe","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/iziNVoG48K6pYFYIA55U4D1C2Gy.jpg","credit_id":"5d6324787f6c8d1b36ed70f8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1979152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamish Newcombe","original_name":"Hamish Newcombe","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/iziNVoG48K6pYFYIA55U4D1C2Gy.jpg","credit_id":"5d63248e6dea3a5cfd935179","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1979152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamish Newcombe","original_name":"Hamish Newcombe","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/iziNVoG48K6pYFYIA55U4D1C2Gy.jpg","credit_id":"5d6324babc8abc176c25b689","department":"Editing","job":"Archival Footage Coordinator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vONof32DDl17DWueqZQEFtP9apu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uMZYq3xebkJkLotKJJgCwNnIEsN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"M","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
