Teaching nursing to local women in a strict Muslim culture that forbids them to even to touch men is a formidable task. However, Grace challenges her own values and belief systems to find common ground with her students, helping them to excel and feel respect for themselves in a culture that doesn't respect them. Whether it is getting her hands painted with henna, swimming fully-clothed in the ocean, or marching bravely with them on International Women's Day, Grace bonds with her students in a very special way, and ultimately discovers how the West can learn a lot more from the Third World than she ever thought.","popularity":0.4663,"poster_path":"/kk2hjDIgqH2Q5i4bSDJqYlxdDxS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kanopy Streaming","origin_country":""},{"id":28620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentary Educational Resources","origin_country":""},{"id":122374,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kanopy (Firm)","origin_country":""},{"id":122375,"logo_path":null,"name":"Esperanto Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Calling to Care is the inspiring story of 55 year-old Grace Stanley, a Canadian nurse who left her home and prestigious career behind to answer a calling halfway around the world in Karachi, Pakistan.","title":"A Calling to Care","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2396646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Stanley","original_name":"Grace Stanley","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d640b00fd7aa400125bda5d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2396646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Stanley","original_name":"Grace Stanley","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6495ebbcf8c97590759bfc","department":"Writing","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505889,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robbie Hart","original_name":"Robbie Hart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d649537813cb60013f90773","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1166121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bobbi Jo Hart","original_name":"Bobbi Jo Hart","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/b6IHnXmPUWTmHEHdUxPBDbC5kGV.jpg","credit_id":"5d648ff5bcf8c97590758f55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1166121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bobbi Jo Hart","original_name":"Bobbi Jo Hart","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/b6IHnXmPUWTmHEHdUxPBDbC5kGV.jpg","credit_id":"5d649002bcf8c90012760ee7","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2396895,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Salimah Hashwani","original_name":"Salimah Hashwani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6495d2813cb60014f9218d","department":"Writing","job":"Other"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0325147","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s3x9qK9G9dxJN7H2gRsMQ51tRCD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1189,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kk2hjDIgqH2Q5i4bSDJqYlxdDxS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":792}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":428,"name":"nurse"},{"id":187,"name":"islam"},{"id":2470,"name":"education"},{"id":7021,"name":"pakistan"},{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"},{"id":191446,"name":"inspiring"},{"id":251150,"name":"cultural identity"},{"id":257155,"name":"karachi"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
