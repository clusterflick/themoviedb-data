She crosses paths with Matt, dropped there a few weeks earlier and just as disoriented as she is. There, weapons are at hand, self-service. Even more accessible than a pizza. There, Eva and Matt seem to be in the grip of an external force. A force that controls them and from which they cannot escape. In this chaos, has their good old technology remained a friend or turned into an enemy? While breathing spaces are rare moments, together they need to fight back for their freedom.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Eva","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muriel Rasolofo","original_name":"Muriel Rasolofo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a92c61238ad2d150e3ab52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fantasia Film Festival 2024","release_date":"2024-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
