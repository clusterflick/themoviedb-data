Shutdown: The Rise and Fall of Direct Action to Stop the War, is an action-packed documentary chronicling how DASW successfully organized to shut down a major US city and how they failed to effectively maintain the organization to fight the war machine and end the occupation of Iraq.  Created by organizers involved with DASW, Shutdown combines detailed information on organizing for a mass action, critical interviews on organizing pitfalls, and the wisdom of hindsight. It is a must-see film for those engaged in the continuous struggle toward social justice.","popularity":0.6858,"poster_path":"/4dTepJ9WWnWquoWY16jpcvJjbaD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sticks and Stones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shutdown: The Rise and Fall of Direct Action to Stop the War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4dTepJ9WWnWquoWY16jpcvJjbaD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4108,"name":"protest"},{"id":5939,"name":"iraq"},{"id":8862,"name":"uprising"},{"id":15087,"name":"iraq war"},{"id":164400,"name":"labor union"},{"id":181557,"name":"anti war protest"},{"id":288298,"name":"san francisco"},{"id":311322,"name":"anti-war"},{"id":314762,"name":"political organizing"},{"id":315816,"name":"anti-war activist"},{"id":317466,"name":"anti-imperialism"},{"id":322766,"name":"direct action"},{"id":324527,"name":"community organizing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SHUTDOWN: The Rise and Fall of Direct Action to Stop the War","key":"57710595","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2013-01-18T21:40:17.000Z","id":"66a9c0dd51d22f3078eefc8c"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SHUTDOWN - The Rise and Fall of Direct Action to Stop the War - trailer","key":"znfPrP-uRgQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2009-02-06T04:05:32.000Z","id":"66a9c0c2e1d640deea59daec"}]}}}
