It is troubled by eutrophication and the lack of oxygen it causes. With Finland's NATO membership, the Baltic Sea has also become part of conflict-sensitive world politics. However, the Baltic Sea is still much more. The wonderful documentary Minun mereni, written, filmed and directed by Ari Heinilä has been a gigantic work. It reveals to us land crabs the amazing beauty of our sea, which is less appreciated. The sea, which changes according to the seasons, offers unique nature experiences. The camera flying in the sky and travelling under the sea picks up spectacular details of the most beautiful destinations in the Archipelago Sea. The voices of the poetic narration act as e.g. Taneli Mäkelä, Irina Björklund and Martti Suosalo.","popularity":0.1829,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2024-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minun mereni","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martti Suosalo","original_name":"Martti Suosalo","popularity":0.1771,"profile_path":"/tSOpd5cqosrkxleYY5XlXkauPpl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"66ab6ac4fe947b8fea507f67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taneli Mäkelä","original_name":"Taneli Mäkelä","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/3WdJLnVQWBBLNEHXuTeI5NubaLZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"66ab6ad6630185022bc00b9c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Björklund","original_name":"Irina Björklund","popularity":0.3627,"profile_path":"/3kHlo4M9TxGpbMQsM8ST4FjH4sp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"66ab6ae785118ad368508324","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4860936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ari Heinilä","original_name":"Ari Heinilä","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"66ab6af7cafe2a3cc3f8dce4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4860945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Havu Westerlund","original_name":"Havu Westerlund","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"66ab6b06ca4548c3b0b2865a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4860936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ari Heinilä","original_name":"Ari Heinilä","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ab6a4e9f6dabe412c00aa7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4860936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ari Heinilä","original_name":"Ari Heinilä","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ab6b1dcafe2a3cc3f8dce9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Espoo Ciné International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
