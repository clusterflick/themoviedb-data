In 1974, a group of local farmers serendipitously unearthed this ancient wonder, revealing thousands of life-size soldiers prepared for battle even in the afterlife. Beyond the warriors, the discovery also encompasses painted figures, stone armor, and the bones of the Emperor’s mistresses, who met their end alongside their ruler. Dan Snow’s exploration uncovers new insights into the First Emperor of China, a ruler who unified the nation through fear and domination. At the heart of the burial complex lies a giant earth pyramid, serving as the final resting place for the Emperor’s body, guarded for eternity by his formidable Terracotta Army.","popularity":0.5182,"poster_path":"/6oHy3JA72mGGWOg9KYH1TtyMU07.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":229995,"logo_path":null,"name":"History Hit","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terracotta Army: The Discovery with Dan Snow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Snow","original_name":"Dan Snow","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/jZmgKAxfywMoEvbIVpuJ9udObrX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"67f35ffd6c3583c9759916a1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2380903,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Edger","original_name":"Mark Edger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f36078a5471a51ee994b29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fp8TvTL3RUKMyveMdTmgmBmsFLB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6oHy3JA72mGGWOg9KYH1TtyMU07.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
