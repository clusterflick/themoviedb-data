A war pilot, a radical revolutionary, and a cinephile... This is the portrait of a man who left the army and built a successful career as businessman in Europe. Only a few people knew that he was also an undercover member of the resistance movement against Turkey’s military regime in early 1970s. Mekin Gönenç later dedicated most of his life to the movies. When he died after suffering a heart attack while swimming in 2011, he left behind thousands of VHS tapes and meticulously crafted home-made film journals. His death between the two blues he cherished most—the sea and the sky— now give some consolation to his wife. Through archives, we trace the journey of a 20th-century romantic.","popularity":0.0895,"poster_path":"/eM2CMYZwV0tuTgXJyLviUXfn01C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"revolution, vhstapes, archive","title":"Blue, Revolution and VHS Tapes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4859826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Güneş Gönenç","original_name":"Güneş Gönenç","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Güneş Gönenç","credit_id":"66aa7e6225446b17debfe3ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4859828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doğan Özgüden","original_name":"Doğan Özgüden","popularity":0.0243,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Doğan Özgüden","credit_id":"66aa7ea434ca74620f756d4b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435054,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ahmet Gürata","original_name":"Ahmet Gürata","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aa7c22f92d01426459e17c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2089129,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Levent Çetin","original_name":"Levent Çetin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aa807a37c278d62abd0c46","department":"Editing","job":"Archival Footage Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2614074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serdar Kökçeoğlu","original_name":"Serdar Kökçeoğlu","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aa7bdb2013b716f1880085","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3255052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hazal Bayar","original_name":"Hazal Bayar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aa7f3f5e0a706dff683b4b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4534095,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tuncer Mert Aydın","original_name":"Tuncer Mert Aydın","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aa7f267c6055b0d04656f0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2989631,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Koray Kantarcıoğlu","original_name":"Koray Kantarcıoğlu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aa80568657210cf0bd0c2f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4859840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yağmur Canpolat","original_name":"Yağmur Canpolat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aa7fef4fe421310cd2a1a1","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4859832,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Elif Dizdaroğlu","original_name":"Elif Dizdaroğlu","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b120abc6d99e9ebd3a3a78","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4859842,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ulviye Aleyna Sarıgül","original_name":"Ulviye Aleyna Sarıgül","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67137e44650248b9db61eb63","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eM2CMYZwV0tuTgXJyLviUXfn01C.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":1668,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ktHYEdngtiaMYEwMPpua8znjLFc.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1253}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
