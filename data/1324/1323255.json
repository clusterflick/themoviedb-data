In this program, social psychologist Dr. Masao Miyamoto, author of Straitjacket Society; Dr. Makoto Shichida, founder of Shichida Children's Academy; the president of Keio University; and others address the true price of making the grade in a society in which only the most intelligent can thrive-or in some cases even survive.
