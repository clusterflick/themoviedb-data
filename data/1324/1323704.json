In 2010, after the loss of his brother Zachary, David climbs Colorado's Blanca Peak to fulfill Zachary's final wish, to say a prayer on top of a mountain. Documenting the ascent, David and his brother-in-law Ranko encounter challenges but ultimately reach the summit for Zachary's memorial. Moved by their journey and praying on top of a mountain they knew this experience was worth sharing with others. This led to the inception of the Saint Nicholas Mountain Climbing club where mountaineering and prayer intertwine.","popularity":0.4063,"poster_path":"/h3lsLz7biSFB1AtQAbjCvnNLuAG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Peak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4860307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksandar Jovic","original_name":"Aleksandar Jovic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aad7b90b55623cb9cd4287","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11256836","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h3lsLz7biSFB1AtQAbjCvnNLuAG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
