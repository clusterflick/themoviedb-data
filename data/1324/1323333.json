Weeks later, Richard pronounced himself King. The boys were never seen again. For centuries it has been assumed that Richard killed his nephews in a craven attempt at glory. But according to some, Richard was no child-killing monster. Rather, he was the finest King England ever had. Others say nobody killed the princes at all, and they lived anonymously into old age, far away from the cut-throat world of the English court. This film seeks the truth behind the mystery of their fate.","popularity":0.254,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":27856,"logo_path":"/jLMbth7gIW0UMxGqHB5zuHk1iJk.png","name":"Channel 5","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Killed The Princes In The Tower?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1623858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Jones","original_name":"Dan Jones","popularity":0.1095,"profile_path":"/vm5VOfv7L8jyGr0uaWrB5lK2gfq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"66a97edcc6c84bdc775c4653","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
