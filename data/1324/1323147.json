A man and a woman begin their respective tales: He saw a woman burst into flames on the street; she saw an American soldier go berserk and drive a tank into a crowd. Produced while Jonas was living in Berlin on an artist's fellowship, the disjunctive narratives are pervaded with a sense of cultural dislocation and alienation. The man and woman occupy separate narrative spaces as they tell their stories, which are intercut with a pastiche of word games, narrative reenactments, filmed sequences, isolated gestures and objects. Memory — elusive and ephemeral, personal and collective — is the catalyst for this complex work.","popularity":0.1684,"poster_path":"/1NPJwrwbBp9K8GvfyXdIywWmEyv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"He Saw Her Burning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Y Sa Lo","original_name":"Y Sa Lo","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66a8faa7b24b3ada9759c554","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1309429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Jonas","original_name":"Joan Jonas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/8rvC6EidwNnIVQvQgjmVdVNbTrp.jpg","credit_id":"66a8fa2addf4cf4b50ebc70a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290921,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Egon Bunne","original_name":"Egon Bunne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a8fa365a3b4e7c92dab180","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":930430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cynthia Beatt","original_name":"Cynthia Beatt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/vPSoNPw3uvJhmPObKsgGSih45R5.jpg","credit_id":"66a8fa4b037c3bc76b5c4533","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756243,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"The Residents","original_name":"The Residents","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a8fa5be90039b18ce0b1b1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gábor Bódy","original_name":"Gábor Bódy","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/x62CjS1jRDVNW6agDFAkYMNuy9F.jpg","credit_id":"66a8fa6f08dbe0dcbb02e8d5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Bódy","original_name":"Vera Bódy","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a8fa807aeef07dc2cd1874","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1NPJwrwbBp9K8GvfyXdIywWmEyv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1179}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
