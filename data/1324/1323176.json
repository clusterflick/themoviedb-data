DISPATCHES' research shows that drug use among pre-teenage and young teenage children is not confined to inner city areas, particular ethnic groups or 'problem' schools.  This programme focuses on the experiences of Damien (13) and Ranjit (14), both drug addicts, and the problems such young people face since there is very little support for that group after the withdrawal of government funds in April 1993.  In 1990 there were 135 drug advisory posts in education. Today there are only 75. Those taking part include various 9 - 14 year-olds who are either users or dealers, Colin Cripps (Newham Youth Awareness project), Rita Funnell (parent of drug-taker), and Chief Supt. David Gilbertson (Notting Hill Police), Yvonne Bailey-Smith (Family Service Units).","popularity":0.0743,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":235178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pillarbox","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1993-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dispatches: Kids on the Rocks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4234289,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kate Snell","original_name":"Kate Snell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self - Reporter (voice)","credit_id":"66a91dd9dc7202362aa37049","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857834,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claire Hynes","original_name":"Claire Hynes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91d028868186636df07aa","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857824,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Lubert","original_name":"Jonathan Lubert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91bee855e944f265fb4f5","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147889,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roy Cornwall","original_name":"Roy Cornwall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91c985ae69445c7cd1a34","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857823,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Souden","original_name":"David Souden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91bcd17ba3ae460933919","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bob Withey","original_name":"Bob Withey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91c6b7232d1f132cd165c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2264149,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Philip Chavannes","original_name":"Philip Chavannes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91c883d276fd298e0cc2b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857831,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rupert Watson","original_name":"Rupert Watson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91ccf6074492018f2a9ed","department":"Crew","job":"Editorial Staff"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857828,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Cardoza","original_name":"Mark Cardoza","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91c2a0b55623cb9cd1c6a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3257977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Roberts","original_name":"Tom Roberts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91bb5c7283b9803cd19e7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1774422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clare Richards","original_name":"Clare Richards","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":"/lwqwJGLsdcsYjyKyC0p1vgeb9sE.jpg","credit_id":"66a91aec224e05328a1a9697","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3235090,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nigel Read","original_name":"Nigel Read","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91c571575dd985adab256","department":"Crew","job":"Mix Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857833,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nigel Carter","original_name":"Nigel Carter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91cf1dd9d9856e65c4fa3","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857825,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Tony Connorton","original_name":"Tony Connorton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a91c0eddf4cf4b50ebc7fc","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30874015","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1993-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
