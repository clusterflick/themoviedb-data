In 'Starting Piece', the performer starts too far away to be captured by the camera; as he walks down the hill, he gradually enters the frame.  In 'Catching Up', the performer and cameraman walk side by side across a field. Sometimes the performer falls as the camera continues its pace; the performer must make an effort to catch up and return into the frame.","popularity":0.0553,"poster_path":"/rgHvW6jkUtNlyGjNP52pFrWcOX2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Attention Studies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vito Acconci","original_name":"Vito Acconci","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/kF3zEReeQUwVaifuUaXNMniO1v8.jpg","credit_id":"66abca74b9e67e4bee82d24c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rgHvW6jkUtNlyGjNP52pFrWcOX2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
