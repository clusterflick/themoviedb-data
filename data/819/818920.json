She had only visited Syria, her father’s country, a few times prior to the start of the civil war. Following her grandmother’s death, a desire grew within her to form a stronger connection to this country of which she knew so little. Serri studied old family photos and films, interviewed members of her family and other Syrians forced to flee their homeland, and in this documentary mixes her own memories with theirs. For some, Syria remains as alive and present as the scent of jasmine, while others' memories have already faded. They don’t usually talk about it, wishing to spare their children the traumas of the past: “They must look to the future.”","popularity":0.1427,"poster_path":"/fO2tfSrVzPMkd67tfx8Or2RnX0f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Portage Films inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Damascus Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054070,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robin Pineda Gould","original_name":"Robin Pineda Gould","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078d800746457003fd6f4e2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2764885,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Audrey-Ann Dupuis-Pierre","original_name":"Audrey-Ann Dupuis-Pierre","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078d834fbe36f00428a21ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Émilie Serri","original_name":"Émilie Serri","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078d81f5b370d0027a41680","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Émilie Serri","original_name":"Émilie Serri","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078d7d829383500404556b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2344517,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Andréanne Chartrand-Beaudry","original_name":"Andréanne Chartrand-Beaudry","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078d8122faf4d0078abfcb2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1790780,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Olivier Gossot","original_name":"Olivier Gossot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078d7ecf6787a0058f5b423","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2438633,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Omar Elhamy","original_name":"Omar Elhamy","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fe13629653f600894e0e6b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Émilie Serri","original_name":"Émilie Serri","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fe14057a4ee7007c729c98","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10264286","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fO2tfSrVzPMkd67tfx8Or2RnX0f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
